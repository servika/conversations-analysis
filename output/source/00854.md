Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sound's good. Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I''m a recruiter, so I use AI to make appealing Job Descriptions to post on Job boards and sites, to brainstorm creative ideas to increase post engagement, to collaborate on choosing which candidates are a better fit for which roles, To correct and enhance grammar, wording, verbiage on my ideas, emails, and other written communications, and for overall insight on how to be a better recruiter, streamline my workflow better, and give candidates the best hiring/onboarding exerience.

AI: That's a really comprehensive way you're integrating AI into recruiting. It sounds like you're using it across multiple stages of the process - from creating job posts all the way through to the candidate experience.

When you mentioned collaborating with AI on choosing which candidates are a better fit for roles, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you and the AI work together on that decision?

User: I normally tell the assistant the job description of the role im hiring for... then, copy and paste 2 persons resume into the chat and as the assistant to tell me which is a better fir for the role and give me the top 5 reasons why, and why those reasons were chosen

AI: That's interesting - so you're essentially having the AI do a side-by-side comparison and justify its reasoning. 

When the AI gives you those top 5 reasons, what do you do with that analysis? Do you typically agree with its assessment, or do you find yourself weighing factors differently than the AI does?

User: Both. some things in the job description the AI may over-prioritize. In those instances, I'll tell them to de prioritize that qual.

AI: That makes sense - you're actively steering the AI's priorities based on your recruiting expertise.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your recruiting process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Calling candidates is a big one where i just have to do it myself because a conversation has to be had organically. I would like if a note taking assistant could transcribe the conversation to make my note taking easier

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the need for that organic, human conversation versus having AI help with the administrative side like transcription. It sounds like you recognize where the human touch is irreplaceable but also see opportunities for AI to support the process.

When you use AI for the tasks you do delegate to it - like writing job descriptions or analyzing resumes - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with the AI, refining things together, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: For instance, If i don't like the wording used, or the role description is too formal or too lax, I'll give that criticism and ask the ai to change it.. we may go back and fourth, but sometimes I may end up having to piece together two sections of two different responses, or add my own sauce to bring it to completion

AI: That's a great example of true collaboration - you're not just accepting what the AI produces, but actively shaping it and sometimes combining different outputs with your own expertise to get the final result.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your organization using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently than your team?

User: I work remote and i can't say we've really brought it into meetings yet to discuss how we leverage it. i assume we are all using it

AI: So you're kind of operating in this space where everyone's probably using AI but it hasn't become an explicit part of your team conversations yet. That's really common right now.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated: not receiving the output i need and having to write it myself
Satisfied: everyday, receiving ideas i never would have otherwise considered,  copy and pasting beautifully written communications, asking for a second pair of eyes without having to hunt someone down with a free block of tine

AI: That's such a vivid contrast - the frustration of having to fall back on doing it yourself versus that daily satisfaction of getting fresh perspectives and polished communications without the usual friction of coordinating with colleagues.

When you mention "ideas I never would have otherwise considered," that really stands out to me. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm thinking about furthering my education honestly to learn more about ai in hr and also to broaden my knowledge reservoir

AI: That's a really proactive approach - investing in learning about AI in HR specifically while also expanding your overall knowledge base.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading for you as a recruiter?

User: I know AI isn't going anywhere so i see myself becoming an expert at integrating and leveraging ai in my everyday workflow to receive the best outcome possible. while being a forever learner as ai is ever-evolving

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - positioning yourself as someone who's going to master the integration rather than resist the change, while staying adaptable as the technology evolves.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you actively collaborate with AI to refine outputs and your recognition of where human conversation remains irreplaceable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your recruiting work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: not that i can think of

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're actively collaborating with AI - from refining job descriptions to getting that "second pair of eyes" without hunting down colleagues - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the frustrations and the daily satisfactions of working with AI. It's clear you're thoughtfully navigating this evolving landscape.

Thanks again for participating in our research!
