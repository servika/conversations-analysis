Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me! No questions, let's begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My typical creative work is editing real estate photos and videos, every now and then I might have to do some "people" photography and events, but mainly Real Estate.

A typical projects involves going out in person to the property to capture whatever the client inquired about, and then back in my office, editing the media to make it MLS ready. If a video was purchased, then I would have to sift through the video clips to find the best ones, put them in Premiere Pro, set the sequence based on the natural flow of the property, and then combine it with background music (cutting clips to a downbeat), and making any minor color correcting edits

AI: That sounds like a really detailed process with both the on-location capture and the post-production work. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: More specifically with photo editing, I find myself using AI tools to remove unwanted objects out of the image, adding in wanted objects, and sometimes asking AI on how to do a new things with editing if it ever comes up that I need to do something new. For example, a while back, I had to learn how to brighten up certain parts of an image to give it a "twilight" effect, I needed the help of AI to learn how to do so without having to go through multiple YouTube videos.

I also use it "uncreatively" in that I have AI help me make email campaigns to reach out to possible clients to help me with my pipeline of clientele. Making up emails to send out cold emails is not fun, so using AI allows me to have more time to actually interact with the people I currently work with and learning new things for my job.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI both directly in your editing work and for the business side of things. It sounds like it's helping you focus your time on what matters most.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: The most recent project that I used AI to help me with was editing out people and vehicle out of an image. Before, doing something like that would have taken an immense amount of time just to remove it, and then you have to worry about replacing it with something to match the background and doing that would just not look seamless because of different lighting and other factors. AI has helped with that process in that it removes, AND adds in background based on the surrounding image and it looks seamless. I use AI through Adobe Lightroom to do so

AI: That sounds like a huge time-saver and quality improvement. When you're using that AI feature in Lightroom to remove and replace elements, how would you describe the collaboration between you and the AI? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: Initially, its me who drives what exactly I want to be removed, but after that, it is all up to the AI to "make" the decisions as far as what it's goin to replace the object with. I haven't really delved too much into it since its simple objects that need to be removed, but if it comes to it, I'm not sure if I would be able to control the level of control in which the AI chooses to replace items with.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about where your control ends and the AI's decision-making begins. It sounds like there's this handoff moment where you set the intention but then trust the AI to execute it.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The time it takes to do any kind of editing. Editing has been so much easier to do and takes way less time now that AI has taken over a big chunk of that. That allows me to get images back to my clients in a timely manner, and allows me to have more time doing other activities than just work.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds really significant for your work-life balance. On the flip side, what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My concerns are that the barrier to entry might become too low and my clients will turn to AI to do their own editing. But without myself behind the camera, I'm pretty sure that my job will not go away any time soon. There will still be a level of "human" needed to get the images in the first place, and without the proper techniques for taking photos, no amount of editing can turn a horrible picture into something great. But if someone knows how to take photos and simply uses AI to edit, then yes, that would concern me.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - recognizing that your expertise behind the camera is still irreplaceable, but being thoughtful about how AI might change the editing landscape. It sounds like you see the human skill in composition and technique as your competitive advantage.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see AI evolving to a place where editing videos will be as easy as editing photos. Currently, it is hard to remove unwanted items, people, and such, from a video clip. It requires niche knowledge on how to do so, and to do it correctly to where the video as a whole doesn't look off. I believe that in the near future, AI will make that easier to manager. Currently, I've seen AI edits that can extend a clip, which to me is already a crazy advancement, that AI can create more frames from essentially nothing, can't wait to see how AI will help with what I've already explained.

AI: That vision of video editing becoming as streamlined as photo editing sounds exciting. The idea of AI creating additional frames and eventually handling complex video object removal seamlessly would certainly transform your workflow even further.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the barrier to entry concerns are balanced by the irreplaceable human expertise you bring to the actual photography.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI is transforming real estate photography - from the dramatic time savings in editing to your thoughtful perspective on maintaining competitive advantage through human expertise behind the camera - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the benefits and concerns around AI in your field. Have a great rest of your day!
