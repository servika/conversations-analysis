Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI often, as I work in retail, but I do occasionally use it to search for information - for example I sometimes ask an AI for information on certain textiles if a customer asks me something that I don't know

AI: That's interesting - so you're using it as a knowledge resource when customers have specific questions you can't answer on the spot. 

Tell me more about those moments when you turn to AI for textile information. What does that interaction look like for you?

User: I will pull up an AI - any of the major ones like Gemini or Chat-GPT quickly on my phone and then just ask it something like 'can a cotton and silk blend top go in the washing machine' and I will relay the answer back to the customer after I have checked the answer alongside another search result

AI: So you're doing a quick verification step - checking the AI answer against another source before sharing it with the customer. That's a thoughtful approach.

What made you decide to add that verification step rather than just relying on the AI's answer directly?

User: I tend to find that AI gets confused easily still, like if the wording is slightly off then it will misconstrue my question and give me the wrong answer, and I can't afford to give customers the wrong answer as they may use this to try to get a refund if my advice leads to them ruining the clothes

AI: That makes complete sense - there's real accountability when your advice could affect someone's clothing and potentially lead to returns or complaints.

When you say AI gets confused with wording, can you walk me through what that looks like? What kinds of misconstruals have you noticed?

User: I've noticed if it focuses on the wrong string of words like if I say can you wash a cotton-blend top with silk sleeves it may claim to answer positively for the whole question but actually only truthfully answer about the cotton-blend part

AI: That's a really specific observation - it sounds like the AI might be parsing parts of your question correctly but missing the complexity of garments with multiple materials.

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I will never ask AI to help me interact with customers or my colleagues in terms of how to speak to them or what to say or what wording to use, eventhough I know AI may be able to offer advice, because I believe it's important to have authentic conversations with people and I don't want to become reliant on AI. I also don't want to be going on my phone to use AI that often

AI: That's a really clear boundary you've drawn. You mentioned not wanting to become reliant on AI for interpersonal interactions - what does that concern about reliance look like for you?

User: I am just worried about the strength of connections we build with other people becoming overly surface-level if we start using AI to lead our conversations, real-world flaws and opinions and speech patterns are important to authenticity

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on maintaining genuine human connection. You've mentioned using AI sparingly and setting clear boundaries around it.

When you do use AI for those textile questions, would you describe your approach as more collaborative - like working through the question together - or do you tend to just ask it directly and take the answer to verify elsewhere?

User: I tend to just ask it directly - it isnt usually a question that I have my own ideas for like a brainstorming question, and I don't have time to do much more than asking it directly as I am usually customer-facing and need the interaction with AI to be as fast as possible

AI: That makes sense - you need efficiency when you're actively helping a customer. The direct question-answer approach fits that time constraint perfectly.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team approach it similarly or differently?

User: My company emphasises efficiency and correctness so that's influenced why I use AI to find answers, otherwise I may not use it at all. They're also trying to be more technologically forward as a whole so I feel like I should try to get on board with this too by being familiar with things like AI. I know a couple other people use AI similarly to search stuff and the staff that have been there longer don't really use it at all, I'm not sure if anyone uses it another way

AI: So there's this interesting dynamic where the company's push toward technology and efficiency is encouraging you to explore AI, but the actual usage seems to vary by how long people have been there.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I always find it really satisfying when a customer asks me and I'm able to give them a really comprehensive answer super fast because of AI, I feel like one of the perks is it usually gives a tiny bit of extra info that I might not have though about. One time I was helping this person who was clearly distressed and in a hurry and I was able to really quickly tell them how they could get a stain out by just checking with AI

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful moment - being able to help someone who was clearly stressed and in a hurry. You mentioned AI often gives you that extra bit of information you might not have thought of.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think a lot about this, it is quite daunting especially that AI could just eventually cause me and a lot of others to just eventually lose our jobs, which I think would be nice if the world could be a bit more automated but only if we werent so reliant on having those jobs as a source of our income. At the moment I think it's important to maintain my skills in areas like I mentioned above such as communications as I think it's important for our brains to stay engaged and not rely too heavily on machines

AI: You've touched on something really significant there - the tension between automation potentially being beneficial in theory, but concerning when livelihoods depend on those jobs.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as time goes on?

User: I can imagine, with the rate that its been evolving lately, that I will start to use AI more at work in the coming months/ years. There have already been talks about using it to map the store to make our understanding of product placement better to be able to show customers to specific pieces more efficiently

AI: That's fascinating - using AI for store mapping and product placement sounds like a much more integrated approach than your current quick lookups. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining authentic human connections and your careful approach to verifying information before sharing it with customers.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think those are pretty much my thoughts!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with authenticity, and how you navigate the practical challenges of using AI in a customer-facing role, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
