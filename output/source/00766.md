Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I currently use AI LLM's to help revise and clarify emails to be professional, friendly, and clear.  Generally I will draft what I want to say and have the AI refine it to give a consistently professional voice to all my emails.   I also use AI programs to sift through wildlife camera trap data (photos) to remove blank photos and categorize different wildlife pictures from our trail cams.  I also use AI to draft reports, develop treatment plans for weeds, guide nursery management activities, and perform research.  When I am starting something that is new to me I will go to the LLM's to give a quick breakdown of the main components of the thing I am studying.  Then I will often dig deeper in research and find sources to verify the information.

AI: That's a fascinating range of applications - from email refinement to wildlife camera analysis to treatment planning. It sounds like you're using AI across very different types of work.

Tell me more about how you use AI for research and studying new topics. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: I start with a general overview question like "What is the typical diet of Grizzly Bears".  Then dig deeper into the subject on follow-ups.  I will generally always ask for sources of scientific articles to help me learn more.  Sometimes I will set up the scientific articles as a "Knowledge Base" for the AI model to use in order to ensure the information I am getting is backed by science.

AI: That's really interesting how you've developed a systematic approach - starting broad, then drilling down, and using the knowledge base feature to ground the AI's responses in scientific literature. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The tasks I prefer to do myself involve face to face meetings with people to strategize.  Coordination between groups, etc. is founded in a personal touch.  Also, field studies would always still partially be done without AI, although it is becoming more and more part of that work as well.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the human connection aspect of strategy meetings and coordination work. You mentioned field studies would "partially" still be done without AI, but that it's becoming more part of that work too.

Can you tell me more about how AI is starting to work its way into your field studies? What's changing there?

User: In the past we used to have field data sheets and pencils to record data on projects.  Now we have developed survey forms through Survey123 and ArcGIS Fieldmaps to enter all the information digitally.  With that there is an opportunity to use AI programs to analyze and organize the data we collect.  Also, we use AI programs for identifying birds, plants, animals, which in the past would require having books and field guides.

AI: That's a significant shift from paper and field guides to digital forms with AI-powered identification tools. It sounds like technology is really transforming how you collect and process field data.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would say it is more collaborative at this point.  I am still involved in most tasks.  I am interested in having more AI Agent work in the near future where I could delegate complete tasks to the AI

AI: That's helpful to understand - you're in more of a collaborative mode now but looking toward more delegation in the future. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently than your peers?

User: I find that in my workplace I am the one who uses AI the most.  Others are really interested, but don't know how to use the tools as much.  I would say that is the biggest challenge, getting people to understand what AI can do and how to use it.  To most I work with AI is some mythical creature that they don't understand.  I myself also have much to learn.  In studying for a certificate in Applied AI from IBM I learned a lot about what AI can do and also some programming of chatbots, Python scripts, etc., but there is still so much to learn to be able to really apply it for streamlining my work.  It's like I know what it can do, but sometimes hard to know which AI programs would work the best for each task.

AI: That's really insightful - you're kind of the AI pioneer in your workplace, but even with your IBM certificate and programming experience, you still face the challenge of matching the right AI tool to each specific task.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have found it difficult to understand how to use AI for projects in ARCGIS.  I still need a lot of education on using Python in relation to analyzing spatial data.  Also, it can be difficult not having clearly defined steps to set up AI workflows.  If that could be demystified and simplified it would be easier to implement and more people would use it.

AI: That frustration with the complexity really comes through - especially around the spatial data analysis and the lack of clear implementation steps. It sounds like there's this gap between knowing AI's potential and actually setting up practical workflows.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think we always need to know the correct ways to do things, even if AI starts to do most of the work.  So I would say maintaining some skills would be important.  How will we know if the AI went wrong if we don't know ourselves what is right?  It's kind of like how I know to use a regular compass and map to get places, even though we now use GPS/GNSS for travelling places.  That backup and understanding is helpful if the systems go down or is in error.

AI: That compass and map analogy is perfect - having that foundational knowledge as a backup and verification system. That's a really thoughtful way to think about skill maintenance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see developing AI Agents for each of our program activities.  They could streamline data evaluation and reporting, help in schedule planning, develop weed treatments plans, provide nursery management planning, and help identify programmatic shifts.   The weight of decision making could be much lower if they are implemented.

AI: That vision of specialized AI agents for each program activity is really compelling - it sounds like you're imagining a future where much of the analytical and planning burden gets distributed to these focused tools.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the AI pioneer in your workplace while still navigating the complexity of implementation, and that compass analogy about maintaining foundational skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
