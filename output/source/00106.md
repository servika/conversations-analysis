Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI within my day job maybe 3-4 times a week, mostly for ideation or to help develop outlines for things like interview scripts, blog articles, etc. I sometimes use it to craft social media captions for me based on some notes I have about the topic I'm trying to write about. I also use it, rarely but sometimes, for research - for example, if I'm trying to find statistics about a certain topic.

AI: That's helpful context. When you mentioned using AI for ideation and developing outlines, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you usually interact with the AI when you're working on something like an interview script?

User: Usually, I will give the AI the topic of the interview, who the person being interviewed is (i.e, their role and company), and then ask the AI to draft a list of questions for me. From there, I'll select the questions I like the most and think are the most relevant, and sometimes I will either end the conversation there or ask the AI to create different versions of those questions for me.

AI: That's interesting - so you're curating and selecting from what the AI generates rather than using everything it produces. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: That's correct, I rarely take everything the AI produces 100% but prefer to curate and use it as a starting point or outline for my own work. There are times when I do prefer to handle tasks myself, even though AI could help. If it's a creative or writing task that I am excited about for example, I will tackle it myself instead of asking AI. Or if there's a very short task like writing a simple headline, and I know I have a good idea and it won't take me long, I'll do it myself.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like your excitement about the creative work and the efficiency of doing simple tasks yourself both play into that decision. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate with it. For example, if it hands me 5 potential interview questions and I like 3 of them, I'll tell it the 3 that I like and ask for it to come with more that are similar to those.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth sounds like a really iterative process. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Workplace culture is definitely changing to be more AI friendly now. My boss tends to use AI a lot, so I feel like I need to as well in order to stay efficient and get my tasks completed quicker than I normally would have in the past.

AI: That pressure to stay efficient is really interesting. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time recently, my boss had be use AI to perform research on best practices for ecommerce content on different retailer platforms. The AI sent over statistics very quickly, but upon double checking them for accuracy, many of them were not correct and so I needed to do some additional research in order to pull the accurate stats. That was frustrating, especially since I doubt my boss or all of my colleagues are fact checking every time they use AI.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially that doubt about whether others are fact-checking. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I often think about how I can actively maintain my writing skills when AI is around. I think ultimately it comes down to the humanization piece, and ensuring that the writing I create always has a connection to the audience from a human perspective.

AI: That focus on human connection is really thoughtful. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine that I will continue to use AI, probably more and more frequently at work, especially as new models come out and evolve. I am embracing it where it makes sense to, and trying to stay up to date on the best ways to use it professionally.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that human connection in your writing and how you're navigating the pressure to stay efficient while still fact-checking AI outputs.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the importance of fact-checking, and maintaining human connection in creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
