Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, let's go

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I tend to use it collaboratively, for content tasks such as refining blog posts, coming up with titles for things,  polishing emails and support ticket replies. I also find it very useful for "rubber duck" debugging, when I'm stuck on something complicated and need to find a way forward (not necessarily a solution, sometimes just a new approach is needed). I also occasionally get it to create code snippets, but they're generally short time saving things rather than big refactors or features. e.g. I recently asked a model to create an Elasticsearch query for me, as I knew it'd be 50 ish lines of deeply nested JSON, and typing that in detail would be tedious. The query generated didn't work, but the structure was close enough that it didn't take much modification to fix.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of uses. I'm particularly intrigued by your "rubber duck" debugging approach - that sounds like a collaborative way of working through problems.

Tell me more about that debugging process. When you're stuck on something complicated, how does that conversation with AI typically unfold?

User: I'll generally explain what it is that I'm trying to do, then describe the error or issue that I'm having. Often the active explaining is enough to make me realise what I've missed or where I might be going wrong, but if not, I find that the models can ask questions about that help me realise what I've not considered.

AI: That's fascinating - so it sounds like sometimes the act of articulating the problem is what unlocks the solution, even before AI responds. And when you do need that back-and-forth, it's the questions AI asks that help you see what you've overlooked.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it for content tasks and debugging, but are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When coding, I find that the results of asking AI to do large feature work autonomously aren't good enough; there are often subtle bugs or issues that require close examination to unearth, and often it's quicker just to write the thing myself that it is to debug the AI generator code. 

When writing content I feel that a collaborative approach just results in the best quality of output.

Unless there were other tasks you were referring to?

AI: No, that covers it well - you've touched on the key areas. It sounds like for substantial coding work, the debugging overhead makes it more efficient to just write it yourself from the start.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? You mentioned collaborative approaches - can you walk me through what that back-and-forth looks like, especially for something like refining a blog post?

User: So today, for example, I was working on a blog post and I roughly described what the article is about, and then asked Claude to generate me some title suggestions. We went through a few different choices, and then I settled on one. This helped me really figure out the tone that I wanted to write the article and and the audience I wanted to write it for.  Then, knowing the tone and audience, I wrote some more rough content and then asked Claude to make improvements, we went back and forth a few times and started turning out something good.

AI: That's a great example of true collaboration - it sounds like the AI helps you clarify your own thinking about tone and audience, and then you build on that foundation together. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself using it differently because of the environment you're in?

User: I'm the only employee here (I run a couple of small online businesses, one is in startup).

AI: Ah, that gives you complete freedom in how you approach AI tools then! Without colleagues or company policies to consider, you can experiment and find what works best for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think when I tried to get AI to generate a new code feature in a web app, it was just making dumb mistakes and fixing one led to more problems, very frustrating.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of situation you mentioned earlier - where debugging AI-generated code becomes more work than just writing it yourself.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying or successful? What made that experience different?

User: I don't know if it ever felt "satisfying".

AI: That's an honest answer. So it sounds like AI is more of a practical tool for you - useful but not necessarily something that creates a sense of satisfaction or accomplishment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think developers that use AI tools will replace developers who don't, but I don't think that AI will replace developers. I also think that standing still in the technology sector is going backwards so you have to continuously update your skill sets in order to be relevant regardless.

AI: That's a really pragmatic view - AI as a tool that enhances developers rather than replaces them, and continuous learning as just part of the territory in tech.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use it, or expanding into different areas?

User: I think perhaps a slow evolution, if it gets better at more creative code work that would be nice, but that doesn't seem to be likely to happen any time soon. There were a few things that would be nice to automate that are quite complicated to code, such as researching customers and measuring their risk for on boarding - it would be nice if AI could help more with that but I'm not sure that the whole agentic thing is quite ready for that yet.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement, and how you've found that practical, incremental approach to be most effective.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Thanks for your time.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI work, the practical limitations you've encountered, and your pragmatic approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
