Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, lets do it!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a body piercer and for a body jewelry company. For the latter I cold email customers, run our social media, and basically work as a customer service person. Basically if I'm not feeling great or don't have energy to think, which happens at least 1 day a week, I'll use AI in part for all of it. When making a social media post I'll ask for opinions and help with captions or call to actions for the post, when cold-emailing customers about specials I'll give AI points I need made and ask them to write an email for me, and occasionally ask for solutions to tech/ shipping other random customer problems.

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI as a kind of backup for those lower-energy days. 

Tell me more about what it's like when you're "not feeling great or don't have energy to think" - what does AI help you accomplish on those days that you might otherwise struggle with?

User: Mostly brain storming, a lot of the time it is simple writing tasks that specifically  need a professional element to them

AI: That makes sense - having AI handle the professional tone when your mental energy is low sounds really practical.

When you do have good energy and feel mentally sharp, are there parts of those same tasks - the social media, cold emails, or customer service - that you prefer to handle yourself? What makes you choose to do it yourself versus using AI?

User: Some aspects I do prefer to think of myself like social media because I want it to feel personal. I don't ever want someone to view our company account and be able to tell it was AI. For cold emails, I care less. They're required of me but I don't believe in this industry cold emails work so I don't have pride in them.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - wanting the social media to feel authentically personal while being more willing to let AI handle the cold emails since you don't believe they're effective anyway.

When you use AI for social media on those lower-energy days, how do you make sure it still comes across as personal and not obviously AI-generated? What's your process there?

User: I will always include a requirement for my prompt that I want it to be unique and personal. I also might edit or cut what it comes up with to make it a little more me.

AI: So you're actively working to maintain that personal voice even when using AI as a starting point. 

When you're using AI for work, would you say you're more collaborating with it back and forth throughout the task, or do you tend to give it what you need and let it handle things more independently?

User: Probably  working collaboratively with anything more creative. For example the jewelry company wanted to make a set of 8 new stickers that all have to do with the piercing industry so we used AI to help come up with creative little slogans and words that were relevant to the career / a lot of piercers/ etc, but typically with cold emails I ask for something with specific perimeters and the first response I copy and paste and use.

AI: That's a really clear pattern - collaborative for creative work where you want input and iteration, but more of a direct handoff for the routine tasks like cold emails.

How have your colleagues or workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk openly about using AI tools, or is it more of an individual choice you've made?

User: I work with 4 people in an office, the owners of the company and one other task person. I have used AI with the other person who works on tasks but I don't make a show of using it in front of the owners, mostly because I want them to think I'm doing all of my work myself. They're older and I have no clue their opinion on AI!

AI: That's such a relatable concern - not wanting to reveal AI use because you're unsure how it would be received, especially by older colleagues or bosses.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Every single time I don't have to write a cold email I feel satisfied. I don't think I can think of being frustrated honestly

AI: That's pretty telling that the cold email assistance brings you such consistent satisfaction! It sounds like AI is really solving a specific pain point there.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially for tasks like writing or creative work?

User: I personally don't feel worried about AI taking over anything creative, but that's just because I believe humans have a specific touch when it comes to storytelling that I don't believe AI could ever replicate. It can't feel, how could it create! But stuff like admin work, re-organizing text or brain storming, I actually love it for the help. As an aid if that makes sense. I think the AI needs me to operate it for these tasks so I don't actively consider it taking over my job

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as fundamentally limited in the creative, emotional realm but valuable as an administrative aid that still needs your direction.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different types of tasks as time goes on?

User: I think anywhere I think it can lend a hand, I'd use it. As my role becomes more planning and coming up with new sale ideas, jewelry ideas, product ideas etc I will use it to come up with new stuff

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a creative collaborator while maintaining that human touch for authentic storytelling - and how you've found it so helpful for those dreaded cold emails!

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically - as a backup for low-energy days, a collaborator for creative brainstorming, and a way to handle those tasks you'd rather not do - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about everything from managing workplace perceptions to your philosophy about AI's creative limitations. Thanks again!
