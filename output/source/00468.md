Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI daily to craft responses to guests through social media. I also use it to assist with special projects, to make sure my wording sounds professional.

AI: That's really helpful to know. When you say you use AI to craft responses to guests through social media, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: My job is to reply to hotel guests that post to social media with a complaint. I use AI to do multiple things. One is to change my reply to fit into the character limits for some social medias. Another is to make my responses sound more empathetic or professional.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI as a communication partner in a really customer-facing role. When you're working on these guest responses, do you typically write a draft yourself first and then have AI help refine it, or do you start by asking AI to generate an initial response that you then edit?

User: I actually use both.  I sometimes write a draft and have AI reword it, or I ask AI to generate a response that I then edit.

AI: That's really interesting that you switch between those approaches. What determines which method you choose in a given situation? Is it based on the type of complaint, how you're feeling that day, or something else entirely?

User: It is entirely based off how I feel that day, how my brain is functioning, or if I just can't come up with a nice thing to say because someone is just being so rude

AI: That's such an honest and relatable answer. It sounds like AI becomes particularly valuable on those tough days when you're dealing with really difficult guests. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of handling these guest complaints that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those parts different for you?

User: I prefer to answer the more personal requests myself. That is typically because I am so familiar with the hotels and their processes, that I find that AI doesn't answer to my liking.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you have that deep institutional knowledge that's hard to replicate. When you say "personal requests," could you give me an example of what that might look like? What distinguishes a personal request from the complaints you're more comfortable having AI help with?

User: A personal request would be someone reaching out wanting to order something for a celebration, requesting an upgrade, or requesting that someone look for a lost item.

AI: I see - so those requests require that specific knowledge you have about what's actually possible at each property and how things work behind the scenes. 

When you do use AI for the complaint responses, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with AI throughout crafting the response, or do you tend to give it the complaint and your requirements and let it handle the response more independently?

User: I typically give it the complaint and my requirements and it gives me a reply. Sometimes I have to ask that it provide more empathy, make it shorter, or make it sound more casual, but mostly it knows what I want because I use it so much

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've developed a working relationship where AI has learned your style over time. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at your hotel use it similarly, or are you more of a pioneer in this area?

User: Many of my colleagues have started to use AI more, in the same ways I have. Some are still anti-AI though, and they don't like to use it at all.

AI: That's a really common dynamic I'm hearing about. For the colleagues who are anti-AI, do they express particular concerns, or is it more of a general resistance? And does this create any tension in how the team approaches guest responses, or do you all just handle things your own way?

User: It is more a general resistance. It does not cause tension, we all do things our own way. As long as we are helping the guests in an accurate way, no one cares how we get there.

AI: That sounds like a really healthy work environment - focused on the outcome rather than the process. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was particularly satisfied with AI when I was putting together a project to help my co-workers build confidence.  I used AI to sort my thoughts into a presentation that made sense, and it was very helpful. It was satisfying to see my thoughts and words put into a presentation that made a difference.

AI: That sounds like such a meaningful use of AI - helping you organize your ideas to ultimately support your colleagues. It's wonderful that it helped you make that kind of impact.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given how much it's helping with your daily communication tasks?

User: I do worry about AI taking over my job sometimes, but my job does require a human touch, which so far, AI is not able to mimic.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective. When you mention the "human touch" that your job requires, what specific aspects are you thinking of? What is it about that human element that feels irreplaceable to you in your work with hotel guests?

User: Being able to provide special services, knowing the inner workings of hotels, and also going above and beyond to make sure a guest is comfortable and satisfied. That requires reading "between the lines" of a conversation, which is not an AI specialty.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the ability to read between the lines and understand what guests really need beyond what they're explicitly asking for. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular ways as the technology continues to develop?

User: I see using AI to develop processes and trainings, as well as other project needs that come up based on team dynamics. I also see more of my team using it for more responses to guests, that are more general.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you when you're having tough days dealing with difficult guests, and your clear understanding of where the human touch remains irreplaceable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: There is nothing else I can think of

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a communication partner in customer service, the balance between AI assistance and human judgment, and how workplace dynamics influence adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about everything from the practical day-to-day uses to the bigger questions about job security and what makes human skills irreplaceable. Have a great rest of your day!
