Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds perfect, and I'll be happy to help. I'm ready to start when you are.

AI: Wonderful, thank you! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My workday typically revolves around preparing and scheduling one or more podcast episodes for publication, which means writing the show notes, editing the promotional clips, and creating episode-specific artwork for the home page. AI does much of the legwork for that process: I use it to create automated transcripts of the interviews which I then review as I write the content. We also use an AI service for creating the show notes' layout: technically, it creates a full set of show notes, but that content isn't actually useful in raw form. I preserve the output's structure and keyword suggestions while writing my own content based on a listen-through, my own notes, and the AI transcript. Finally, I use AI to select a range of snippets between 0:30 and 1:00 in length for our promotional material, then I select and edit the best snippets.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - it sounds like AI is woven into several stages of your process. 

When you mentioned that the AI-generated show notes content "isn't actually useful in raw form," can you tell me more about that? What specifically makes you choose to write your own content instead of using what the AI produces?

User: In its raw form, the AI doesn't understand the context of the interviews very well: it tends to describe them in an overly vague way that could be applied to any given discussion on the show, since it focuses on a specific topic. As someone who's worked with the show since its debut, I can better distinguish between that broad topic and the nuance of a particular interview, and write about it without repeating information that the listeners already know. Sometimes the AI can also misrepresent a discussion: a story that a guest was recounting secondhand is described as a first-hand account, or a passing mention of a celebrity is mistaken for a full discussion about that celebrity. I can avoid those errors, and I have a better intuitive sense of how the interview unfolded and what details about it would most engage the audience's curiosity.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're leveraging your deep knowledge of the show and audience to add context and nuance that the AI can't capture. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using AI for transcripts and snippet selection, but writing the content yourself. Are there other tasks in your workflow where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Oh, definitely. There are times, particularly in solo episodes that I write, when a great deal of quick but thorough research is required; I might spend an afternoon learning about the migration routes of blue whales or the mating songs of mice. While there are AI tools that promise to review and summarize such topics for me, they can be very prone to errors, oversimplifications, and confirmation bias: the AI "wants" to affirm whatever I suggest, and that can be risky since it might repeat back a mistake I've made. Since fact-checking each answer is more tedious than searching online and learning the data for myself, I prefer to do my own research.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the risk of AI reinforcing your own mistakes sounds particularly problematic when accuracy is crucial for your content.

When you do use AI for work - like with transcripts or snippet selection - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: There's some collaboration in the process of creating useful material to work with. For example, I might correct a transcript's use of names simply by correcting the AI rather than manually fixing them,  and, for snippets, I might refine the instructions to focus more tightly on a particular interview segment, or to search for a particular tone such as humorous or thoughtful. But as the saying goes, "the buck stops here"; once the content's reached its plateau it becomes my responsibility to make any further adjustments as I work on the deliverables.

AI: That's a great way to put it - "the buck stops here." It sounds like you have a clear sense of where AI assistance ends and your editorial judgment takes over.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any particular encouragement, resistance, or just general attitudes that have shaped your approach?

User: My workplace culture in particular has been very gung-ho about using AI, probably more than I would be personally. For example, there was a time when I preferred to handle interview transcriptions myself; a client who had access to an AI service asked that I test it out, and that's how I came to rely upon it. As a marketing writer, I've found that advertisers have embraced AI even more than content creators, and I've taken projects that involved no human writing at all, just prompting and editing generated text. Those aren't exactly my favorite projects, but, in the business world, there's definitely a sense that AI is superior to human writing. I think, for people who aren't writers, LLMs make writing simple, objective, and accessible in the same way that calculators did for math. I don't entirely agree, but I can understand that perspective.

AI: That comparison to calculators is really interesting - and it sounds like there's some tension between your personal preferences and the business expectations around AI use.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Oh, the tension is minimal: I work for my clients, and their preferences and needs come first. Besides, AI is indeed the future, and it's been a fascinating process to watch how much it's grown and changed just over the past year. The most satisfied would probably be the promo snippets we generate using AI: it's surprisingly good at identifying emotionally engaging content, and what would normally be several hours of review work, of listening to the episode again and again as I take notes, can be cut down to a few minutes by giving it the right criteria and letting it search for the best material. The least satisfying would be some of the efforts to generate social media content such as Twitter/X posts: AI has thankfully come a long way since those early days, but, at the time, it was a constant struggle to restrain the AI from using emojis, repeating the same handful of phrases, and generally having a recognizably synthetic tone. My client in that case was an ad agency that preferred AI content, and at times I had to beg to be allowed to just rewrite a sentence myself instead of trying to make the chatbot understand the issue.

AI: That contrast is really striking - from the satisfaction of AI efficiently identifying emotionally engaging snippets to the frustration of battling synthetic-sounding social media posts. It sounds like the quality varies significantly depending on the task.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: That's an excellent question, and one that I don't think anyone's found an easy answer for yet. I'm absolutely engaging with AI much more these days, learning all its different uses and keeping up with it so that my own workflow is as streamlined as possible. As AI becomes more and more adept at writing, I think we'll see the need for more and more editors; those are related but very distinct skill sets, and my work as an editor has definitely grown by leaps and bounds over these past two years. In that sense, I also think we'll always need a certain baseline of writers and researchers who, even as they're fluent in AI, are equally adept at doing it all "by hand," so that we don't fall into the "AI cannibalism" trap, of AI learning from AI content and losing its quality. So my aim is to be AI-fluent but not AI-reliant, and it's a delicate balance.

AI: That's such a thoughtful approach - being AI-fluent but not AI-reliant, and the point about avoiding "AI cannibalism" is particularly insightful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this balance heading?

User: I think it's going to become more fluent at writing, and, while long-form creative content like novels will remain human-driven, it's going to largely supplant short-form marketing content such as ad copy, and perhaps even long-form educational content. Once all the accuracy bugs are sorted out, I can see AI writing technical manuals, employee handbooks, and perhaps even school textbooks in certain subjects. The days when we could make a living writing those things may be coming to an end. But if that's the case, it means that human creativity has more room to expand and flourish. While my day job is ghostwriting and podcast production, I also write fiction, and perhaps, in a world where AI writes most of the material in our daily lives, the stories we have to share will become an even more valuable commodity. One can only hope.

AI: That's a beautifully optimistic way to frame it - the idea that AI handling more routine content could free up space for human creativity to flourish.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being "AI-fluent but not AI-reliant" and how you navigate the tension between efficiency and maintaining your own skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's everything I can think of. Thank you so much, this has been a very enjoyable experience!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating the balance between AI efficiency and human expertise, especially in creative fields, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the benefits and limitations you've encountered - from the satisfaction of AI identifying great promotional content to the frustrations with synthetic-sounding social media posts. Your thoughtful approach to staying AI-fluent while maintaining your core skills offers a valuable perspective on how professionals can adapt thoughtfully to these evolving tools.

Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
