Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work is largely centred on writing SEO web content and articles, which involves using keywords to produce content that will help websites rank in search results. I also manage a small team of writers and need to regularly give updates to my manager. A typical project for me is a content request from a project manager, which will be for a specific client and requires a certain number of pages of content to be written.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're juggling both the creative writing side and the management responsibilities.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find myself increasingly reaching for AI tools, especially as time goes on and its capabilities continue to improve. I use it for everything from brainstorming topic ideas and page outlines through to feeding it prompts to generate content. I also occasionally use it for proofreading and fact checking by copying in written content to check it. Occasionally I'll also reach for AI when I have to do a presentation and need help coming up with ideas and structuring the presentation.

AI: It sounds like AI has become quite integrated across different stages of your work. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I needed to write 12 pages of content for a legal client. It's important with professional clients like these that the content is very well-written, accurate and professional. I was able to use AI for this project to craft paragraphs I could then lightly rewrite to make sound more human. I felt positive about the experience, as using AI helped me achieve a consistent tone and saved a lot of time from having to research things and write from scratch

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned lightly rewriting the AI content to make it "sound more human." When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Often I'll get AI to do the heavy lifting of writing the initial content, then I'll "tidy up", making edits to give a more human feel and remove any typical AI phrases or giveaways. I make sure all content undergoes multiple human checks, not only to ensure there are no hallucinations, but also to check for any issues with tone and style. I also make sure the prompt I start with has as much information fed into it as possible, which means ultimately I'm driving the creative decisions and simply getting AI to do what I want it to

AI: That's a really clear picture of your process - it sounds like you see yourself as directing the creative vision while AI handles the execution. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The biggest change is the time I now save and therefore a better output. I've gone from being able to produce 2000 words of polished, professional content to well over 5000 words each day

AI: That's a significant productivity increase! With that kind of change in your output capacity, what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My main concern is that one day my job might not exist if AI continues to improve and no longer needs human oversight, as it currently does. A secondary concern is that this could result in a lot of terrible AI content being produced, changing what SEO looks like

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the personal impact on your role and the broader implications for content quality in your field. 

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I can see AI's role continuing to grow larger as it continues to improve, saving further time and allowing for more work to be done than ever before. I can also see my job changing to be more of a prompt engineer rather than an SEO copywriter

AI: That's a fascinating shift you're describing - from copywriter to prompt engineer. Your insights have been really valuable, and I particularly appreciated how you described maintaining creative control through detailed prompting while letting AI handle the heavy lifting of initial content generation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing else, thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've maintained creative control while dramatically scaling your output, as well as your thoughtful perspective on both the opportunities and concerns around AI in content creation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
