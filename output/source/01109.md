Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Totally. Over the past 6 months, I began to work closely with the social media side of things at my Martial Arts locations (they're sister schools). I pretty much run the show, I come up with content ideas, film, edit, generate captions/hashtags, post and even respond to comments. Right now, we're primarily focused on Meta apps (Instagram and Facebook) but I do light work on Google Business and have recently begun to integrate our reels over to TikTok. Its a lot of fun, especially because I'm always learning something. I came to this job with literally no prior knowledge besides having some of my own videos on TikTok go viral. Projects vary, as I'm always trying new things, but we do have a consistent "Student of the Week," segment I prepare for all content, including OptiSigns.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic role with a lot of variety! I can see how you'd be constantly learning and adapting with all those different platforms and content types.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: All. The. Time. hahaha! ChatGPT is my best friend when it comes to caption generating. *I really hate *

AI: Tell me more about that - what is it that you really hate? I'm curious to hear where you were going with that thought!

User: My bad, I'm gonna be so honest I accidentally started italicizing my words and was trying to fix it hahahaha. I really hate coming up with captions, especially because I'm posting so many different types of content every single day between two schools. It can be very taxing, especially because I also am an instructor/manager of one location and that is my primary role. By being able to just spit out what is racing through my head and have a LLM generate the perfect captions, even adhering to shifting things slightly for different forms on content is incredible. I sometimes will go as far as hashtag generating, but I still feel like AI needs some work on that. Occasionally, I will use AI for straight up ideas, but rarely. I find in my experience AI doesn't pick up on the trends fast enough to make meaningful video ideas.

AI: That's really insightful! So it sounds like AI is most valuable to you for translating your ideas into polished captions, but you're still the one driving the creative direction and staying on top of trends.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Sure! Often, like I said previously, is I really just start spit balling out what I'm looking for in a caption. Most recently, I made a video targeted towards beginners. It was just some clips from our beginner KB class and the video read, "POV: You're not Afraid to be a Beginner." I really wanted that vibe to represent well in the caption, without sounding like I was making a sale, or being condescending. I used ChatGPT specifically for this. Its often my go-to. I find that when a long caption is needed, say for an Instagram Reel like I needed here, it does excellent and hits it on the money every time (Granted, I provide a lot of detail. My ADHD brain just goes lol) but it struggles to do the same for short, punchier captions. This can be frustrating when I'm on a time crunch (which I was at this time) This video in particular needed to be posted to Instagram and TIkTok, but it took 5 tries to get a caption I liked for TikTok that matched the vibe but was much more concise.

AI: That's a great example - I can really see the nuance in what you're describing. It sounds like AI excels when you can give it that detailed context from your ADHD brain, but struggles with the more condensed formats.

When you're working with AI like that - going through those 5 tries for the TikTok caption - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that back-and-forth?

User: Me, for sure. In my experience, I don't find that chatbot going out of its way to provide that type of insight. Sure, follow up questions are usually included but they're very simple, "how's this look?" type of stuff.

AI: That makes sense - you're clearly in the driver's seat throughout that process.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'm less stressed, honestly. It has created a ton of efficiency for me so I can focus on my favorite aspects of the job (filming and editing)

AI: That's wonderful that it's reduced your stress and freed you up for the parts you enjoy most! 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: As much as I praise AI, I do worry about the overall impact it will have. I find AI can easily replace social media managers one day, which is essentially my job and honestly my dream is to pursue it head on one day. I'm more so worried about the impact it will have on spreading false info, however. Even now you see it, a simple google search prompts an AI response and its often wrong. I don't want my work to be tainted.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the professional impact and the broader issue of misinformation. It sounds like you're experiencing this tension between AI making your current work better while also potentially threatening the field you want to pursue.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: The ultimate hope is that AI will become intelligent enough to help predict trends accurately. This will make coming up with content even easier. I'd hope if this the case, it also would have well rounded hashtag generation, and could come up with hashtags based on the apps being used, and what is generating views at the time. I think AI will playing a huge part in creating and  sustaining engagement for sure.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - AI that could essentially become your trend-spotting partner and adapt hashtags in real-time based on platform performance.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as that bridge between your racing ADHD thoughts and polished content, while you maintain creative control throughout.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think thats it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a translation tool for your creative ideas, while staying firmly in control of the creative direction, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. 

I really appreciated your honesty about both the benefits - like reducing stress and creating efficiency - and your concerns about the future impact on your field. That kind of nuanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand how AI is really being used in the wild.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your social media work for the martial arts schools!
