Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: O, let's begin

AI: Great! Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently I use it to generate ideas for sales and marketing emails to existing or potential clients. I will ask for suggestions for catchy email subjects, brainstorm themes for email campaigns, and suggestions on product offerings that will be important to my clients

AI: That sounds like you're using AI as a creative partner for your outreach efforts. 

Tell me more about how you work with AI when you're brainstorming those email themes - do you come to it with a rough idea already in mind, or do you start completely from scratch with AI?

User: I come to it with a rough idea in mind and input the parameters accordingly

AI: I see - so you're providing the framework and letting AI build within those boundaries.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your sales and marketing work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to write the email myself, using the ideas and suggestions provided by the AI. I do not use AI to draft the acual email. I prefer to do this myself as I want the tone to sound like me and I enjoy doing it

AI: That's really interesting - you're drawing a clear line between ideation and execution. It sounds like maintaining your personal voice and the actual craft of writing are important to you.

When you are using AI for those brainstorming sessions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Do you tend to go back and forth with it, refining ideas together, or do you ask for a batch of suggestions and then work with what you get?

User: It depends on the quality of the first batch of suggestions, if it sparks an idea I will work with what I initially get. If it does not spark inspiration right away I will go back and forth, refining my thoughts on what I would like to say and use the suggestions from AI to narrow down to what I think is the best idea to proceed with

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're letting the quality of the initial output guide how deep you go into the collaboration.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: I have developed my own approach. I work very independantly and have autonomy to prepare my own marketing and email communications in whatever way I see fit

AI: That autonomy sounds like it's given you the freedom to experiment and find what works best for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I am generally satisfied with the result of what I am using AI for, I recently crafted an email campaign to highlight 3 product offerings to our existing customer base. I wanted creative ways to present them that would set me apart from the competition and resonate with my customers and using ChatGPT to  generate suggestions, really got those creative juices flowing

AI: That sounds like a really successful collaboration where AI helped unlock your own creativity. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have been thinking about utlizing AI for more routine, menial tasks, however I do have concern that new people joining will then not learn properly how to do these tasks on their own, and will therefore not know how to identify if there is an error with the AI or be able to modify and correct where needed

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern about the learning curve for newcomers and the importance of foundational knowledge. It sounds like you see value in understanding the basics before leveraging AI assistance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will continue to use it for creative brainstorning, and will slowly test out using it for routine and menial tasks. If that goes well, I will explore what other aspects of my job could be streamlined with the use of AI. I will implement a rule that it is not available to new staff until they have shown a strong foundational knowledge of how to do the tasks without AI support

AI: That's a really strategic approach - both for your own work evolution and for managing how new team members develop their skills.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's creative capabilities while preserving the human elements you value, like your personal writing voice and ensuring foundational skill development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative brainstorming partner while maintaining your own voice, and your thoughtful approach to skill development for new team members, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
