Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a content creator that runs faceless Instagram and TikTok pages. I use AI daily to generate images, videos and text for these videos. Also, occasionally for inspiration or ideas on what to post. I sometimes try to use it for analyctics.

AI: That sounds like AI is pretty integral to your content creation process. When you say you use it for analytics, what does that look like exactly? What kind of analytics are you trying to get help with?

User: It is. It helps me massively because I save time not having to stage and record my own videos/take my own photos. Well in a perfect world, it would be able to tell me the optimum time to post content, which content to post, who to target, etc.

AI: That makes sense - you'd want it to handle the strategic side too, not just content creation. When you say "in a perfect world," it sounds like the analytics piece isn't quite working the way you'd like it to. What's happening when you try to use AI for those analytics tasks right now?

User: That's accurate. As it stands, those platforms have their own insights and analyctic tools, but there are often barriers to entry. For example I might need a certain amount of followers or views before I can see all the data. This makes starting new accounts more of a guessing game. If there were AI chatbots that I could upload my account data to that would be able to assess it for me then it would ease the process, make it quicker and, therefore, more profitable. At present I have not found a model that can do this for me.

AI: That's a really interesting gap you've identified - being locked out of the platform analytics when you're just starting out, right when you probably need that data most. 

When you're working on the content creation side where AI is helping you a lot, how do you typically interact with it? Are you collaborating back and forth throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete brief and let it handle things independently?

User: I usually give it a brief of what I'd like generated, if I'm currently creating a post. However, there are times that I ask it for ideas or scripts. However, I find most models seem to struggle taking their own ideas and then generating acceptable images/videos from them. I often need to parrot their idea back to them with some specifics and make it clear I'm asking for it to generate that particular image/video. Most models seem to struggle to generate more than one image at a time as well, for example, if I say "Those three ideas sound good" or "Generate me three images of..." it will still usually only produce one. I then have to ask for the others separately.

AI: That's a frustrating workflow issue - having to break down what should be a simple multi-part request into separate steps. It sounds like there's a disconnect between the AI's ability to conceptualize multiple ideas versus executing them all at once.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your content creation process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I prefer to write my own captions and comments, I feel that whenever I use an AI generated piece of text it stands out like a sore thumb. I'm aware that may seem hypocritical when I'm using AI to make the images in the first place, but I think I can hook people more efficiently with that human-touch. I also prefer genuine video and photos to AI generated, but I don't always have the time or resources to capture high quality and appropriate content. The task I am probably most comfortable leaving with AI is combining images or clips to make a reel, that does save me a lot of time as well and tends to come out as well as if I'd done it myself.

AI: That's really insightful - you've found this sweet spot where you keep the voice and personality human while letting AI handle the more technical production work. The distinction you're making between where the "human touch" matters versus where efficiency wins out is fascinating.

How have your colleagues or other content creators in your space influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself adapting your approach based on what others are doing?

User: I don't speak to a lot of other content creators about this, but a lot of creators that I know are passionately against the idea of using AI generated images/videos, but don't mind using it to assist with the admin side of it. However, I can also see, from being on the platforms, that it is a growing trend to see AI generation in these spaces. It also allows for a low cost startup. You may need to purchase a subscription, but you don't need to purchase a high quality camera, studio space, props, etc. Meaning you save time as well as money.

AI: That tension you're describing is really interesting - the philosophical resistance from some creators versus the practical reality of seeing more AI-generated content succeed on the platforms. It sounds like you've landed somewhere in the middle, weighing those practical benefits against the creative considerations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure, only last night I was trying to create an image that depicted a front room on a traditional style Christmas morning from the 80s or 90s, but the model was constantly adding wall-mounted televisions or other modern references. I also, often, have trouble getting the generated images to look realistic, they often look like a picture instead of a photo.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - trying to get that specific nostalgic aesthetic but having the AI keep inserting anachronistic elements. And the "picture instead of a photo" issue you mention is interesting - like it's too polished or artificial looking?

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying or when it really clicked for you?

User: Too artificial looking is probably a good way to describe it.

For sure, there's plenty of times its been excellent for me. A few days ago, I was having a bit of a creative block, so I had a conversation with a chatbot and we bounced ideas back and forth, then before I knew it, I had an A4 page of ideas that will last me weeks.

AI: That's such a great example of AI working as a creative partner rather than just a tool - that back-and-forth brainstorming session sounds really productive. It's interesting how different that collaborative approach was from some of the more transactional interactions you described earlier.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you're building your content creation business?

User: It definitely is. I can imagine that, eventually, platforms such as TikTok will adpot their own AI which will generate content for people. I don't think I support that. As it stands, you can use AI to your advantage or to "cheat" as some people call it, but you still need to have the ideas, collect the content, put it together, edit it, polish it, caption it, choose when to post it, etc. If all of that is taken away then I think it would somewhat decrease the value of what content creators do.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you're distinguishing between using AI as a tool to enhance your creative process versus having it replace the creative decision-making entirely. It sounds like you see value in maintaining control over the strategy and creative direction.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think this is all heading for you as a content creator?

User: I think it will continue in the same vein for a while yet. Hopefully it will get better at generating realistic images/videos. Maybe one day a personal AI account will be like an assistant. So it's on my phone, smart watch, PC, etc. and if I take a photo when out and about, I can just ask it to file into my ideas folder on my PC, then when I get home I can open it up, edit it and create a post from it, ask the assistant to post it for me, while I do something else. Something akin to that could be very useful.

AI: That vision of a seamless AI assistant that follows you across devices and handles the workflow logistics sounds really compelling - especially that ability to capture inspiration in the moment and have it automatically organized for later use.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on where you draw the line between using AI as a creative tool versus maintaining that human touch in your voice and strategy.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your content creation work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI efficiency with creative authenticity, and especially your thoughts on the evolving landscape for content creators, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
