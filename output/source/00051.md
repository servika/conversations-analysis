Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! I don't have any questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent research project was related to modeling the sulfur content in Titan's subsurface ocean (a moon of Saturn). My project prior to this was also related to modeling Titan's subsurface ocean so it made sense to continue along this path. One of the big unanswered questions about Titan's ocean composition is whether it's primarily dominated by sodium chloride, ammonia sulfate or magnesium sulfate so it also made sense to model the stability of sulfur in Titan's ocean to attempt to answer this question. Lastly, we were also interested in knowing whether sulfur primarily takes the form of sulfide vs. sulfate and what the ocean's redox state is. In order to create this model, we used a geochemical modeling software called EQ3/6 which models the equilibrium state for a given aqueous composition and also models water/rock interactions and the resulting equilibrium state. In the end we found that sulfates were the main form of sulfur and that the ocean could very well be dominated by sulfates.

AI: That's fascinating work on Titan's ocean chemistry! It sounds like a complex modeling challenge with some significant implications for understanding the moon's habitability.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: When I was doing background research for this project, I ran into some issues with understanding the significance of determining the redox state for Titan's ocean as well as what the key factors are during a planet's formation that determine its redox state. I had come into this project with a physics background instead of a chemistry background and felt a little lost in understanding these concepts. I used AI to help me better understand these concepts. I also used AI when I was looking for high pressure low temperature thermodynamic data for a specific mineral which I wanted to add to the software's database. I was having a hard time finding papers containing that data using my usual search methods and asked AI if it could suggest any papers that might be helpful. There might have been one other time when I asked AI for help with finding papers containing specific information.

AI: That's really helpful to understand how AI fit into your research process. I'm curious about that first example you mentioned - when you were trying to understand redox states and planetary formation factors. 

Tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for getting up to speed on those chemistry concepts.

User: I had already tried my traditional approach and was still struggling to understand the concept. I was also struggling since the textbooks and papers I was reading through didn't quite answer my exact question. I decided to use AI since I'd be able to ask the specific question that I wanted the answer to and would hopefully get a response that would be understandable to me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI when you needed that specific, targeted explanation. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Mostly feeling nervous about it getting information incorrect. Especially in areas where I'm not very confident and don't have a lot of knowledge, I'd worry that I wouldn't know enough to identify if or when AI explained something incorrectly.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern - the challenge of not knowing what you don't know when working in areas outside your expertise.

When you did use AI for those chemistry concepts and paper searches, how did you verify or validate what it produced?

User: It was easy for the paper searches; I just looked up the papers it suggested to see if the data was there. For the chemistry concepts, I cross referenced with the textbooks I had been using as well as looking at the sources that it cited.

AI: That's a smart verification approach - especially checking the sources it cited. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Definitely finding papers that focus on specific concepts. My field (planetary science) is extremely interdisciplinary and relevant papers could be buried in any number of journals focused on any number of topics (chemistry, biology, geology, physics, astronomy, etc.). Digging through all of this on my own can become extremely overwhelming and time consuming! Especially when you factor in that different fields use different terminology as well! Then it becomes a game of trying different combinations of keywords and terminology from different fields to try to find the right paper with the right data or information. If AI could help me sift through literature more easily, I would absolutely love that.

AI: That interdisciplinary search challenge sounds incredibly frustrating - having to essentially translate between different field terminologies while hunting for the right papers across so many different journals.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI can help bridge knowledge gaps while being mindful of verification challenges were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the challenge of interdisciplinary literature searches and how you navigate trust through cross-referencing really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's clear that AI has found a valuable place in helping you bridge knowledge gaps between your physics background and chemistry concepts you needed to understand, while you've developed thoughtful verification strategies to manage the trust question. Your vision for AI helping navigate the complex, multi-field literature landscape in planetary science particularly resonated with me.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
