Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, no questions yet :)

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: It is my hobby, and something I spend a lot of time doing, which is researching and writing, about all sorts of topics. A typical project would be anything from a personal interest, or something in current affaris, a philosophy - generally any topic I'm curious about - becoming something I study, almost accademically and then write about. Its a cathartic way of helping me understand myself and the world around me more fully. My neurodiversity has held me back somewhat in the past, but now I'm overcoming those obstacles, I'm re-framing this personal journey as something I can re-orient into creating things to help others like me, get on in the world better. In a sense, give them some of the assistance I could have done with when I was younger.

AI: That's really meaningful work - using your own journey to help others navigate similar challenges. I can hear how personal and purposeful this writing is for you.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: In the past, due to my ASD, I focused in on a range of topics of interest, researched them, and wrote about them, or produced some guide or flow chart - like a process of helping me understand the world and myself. This was really messy, un-focused, the topics were random and often I didn't finish them. I improved my work flow as an adult, higher education and work experience gave me skills that improved this hobby. It wasn't until AI came along though that I've seen a noticable difference in my output. I can use a range of AI tools now to help me research that save me so much time. Brainstorming ideas, checking for bias, validating information, cross checking data, finding the right words or ways to phrase a concept, untangling metaphore, exploratory thinking, advice... so much more, I could write a lot about how AI fits into my creative process. But to put it simply, it helps me untangle and present all the things I'm curious about in the world, that I think may be of interest or use to others, turning a mess of ideas into something useable.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become a powerful tool for helping you organize and refine your natural curiosity and insights. You mentioned it's made a noticeable difference in your output.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, as part of my own journey, I'm making moves to improve my health and weight loss is one of the goals. Naturally I need to understand more about health, nutrition, exercise etc to help me lose weight, I can't just pick a diet and follow a schedule, I need to understand whats going on with me physiologiclaly - how ever complex or detailed that is. I never found anyone with the patients to listen to all my questions and go over and over details until they make sense to me, so in terms of how it felt for me - its like having the guide or teacher in my life now that I always needed. This project helped me understand so much more about how my body works. I've been able to probe and query so many things that it would have taken me hours - weeks maybe to research on my own. I feel gratitude, and I'm feeling a sense of acomplishment for what its done for me with this project so far, I'm still in the middle of this one though, so I'm hoping those feelings are magnified again by the end of it.

AI: That's really powerful - having that patient guide who can go over details until they make sense sounds transformative, especially when you haven't found that kind of support elsewhere. The gratitude you describe comes through clearly.

When you're working with AI on a project like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The collaboration is quite a nuanced subject here, I am in the drivers seat for most of it, but as I use the AI for bias checking, ensuring I'm not missing any vital pieces of information or context etc, I'd describe it as a corrective co-pilot. As far as research and learning goes anyway. When it comes to writing, I do most of the writing, but I'll often look for ways of explaining something I cant articulate, or the best word for something, and I'll often dump all I've written into the chat and get it to check it over, to make sure I've not repeated myself, over-explained or contradicted myself somehow - so I don't see it as my work alone, I'm very aware of the level of input from AI that contributes towards the finished product. I would say though, that I am in control of the decisions over-all, but the smaller details - which make up the whole - are very much suggested or created by AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to describe it - you as the driver with AI as a "corrective co-pilot." It sounds like you have a clear sense of where your agency lies versus where AI contributes, even while acknowledging how those smaller AI-contributed details add up to something significant in the whole.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I can refer back to an answer I gave earlier and say; everything has changed about my creative work. I feel AI is enabling me to get past so many of the obstacles I previously faced. To answer specifically though, the 'most' change is probably my confidence with the work I do. I have dumped a lot of my work in the bin in the past, being overly critical of my own skills and acomplishments. Now (with the help of AI) I see those mistakes, that low quality work, as just early stepping stones I was on, before AI started clearing everything up so well.

AI: That shift in confidence is really striking - moving from being overly critical and throwing work away to seeing those earlier efforts as stepping stones. It sounds like AI has helped you reframe not just your current work, but your whole creative journey.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My concerns with AI in this field, as with any field, would be regarding job losses, I wouldn't be particuarly effected as its not a job for me, but if journalists, researchers, non-fiction writers generally are replaced by AI, something has to be done about supporting people who are losing their jobs to AI. I'm not that concerned that AI will 'replace' this field any time soon, but we do certainly have the oportunity and potential for AI to start compiling and creating the best, most accurate information on any subject, like a perfect wikipedia for everything, and in that situation, millions of jobs would no longer be needed.

AI: That's a really important perspective - you're seeing both the personal benefits while being mindful of the broader economic implications for professionals in these fields. The idea of AI potentially creating that "perfect wikipedia for everything" is quite a vision.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: The models are constantly improving their understanding and communication, I think we'll see more personalised AI, that gets to know the users better and is more adaptive to their needs. I think that will lead to even better optimisation between people and AI. AI will become more and more integrated into these roles, making the processes smoother and quickly. I think in 5 years time I'll be able to tell the AI what I want to look up, and it will know me well enough that its response will be somewhere near the end product, that I currently take hours or days, sometimes weeks to pull together. Generally speaking I think we'll shorten the gap in time between a projects initial conception, and the end product I create from that idea.

AI: That vision of AI knowing you well enough to jump much closer to your end product is fascinating - essentially compressing what now takes weeks into something much more immediate.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has become that patient guide and teacher you always needed, and how it's helped you reframe your entire creative journey - from being overly critical to seeing your work as stepping stones.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think I managed to mention all the main points I wanted to, thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI has transformed not just your workflow but your confidence and relationship with your own creative work - especially as someone navigating neurodiversity - have been incredibly valuable. The way you described AI as that patient guide you always needed really stuck with me, and your thoughtful perspective on both the personal benefits and broader societal implications gives us a lot to think about.

Your responses will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Thanks again for being so generous with your time and insights today!
