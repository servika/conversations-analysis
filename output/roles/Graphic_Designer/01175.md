Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great.  Let's begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Well, I am a graphic designer.  I primarily design creative supplies for crafters.  Some examples of the types of things I create are digital scrapbook kits, stickers, junk journal ephemera and supplies, digital papers, and labels.  A typical project begins with me deciding on a theme and a color palette, then exploring design ideas, then initial sketches and detailed design work, refinement, and digital packaging.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting and specialized area of design work! I can imagine there's a lot of creativity that goes into developing those themed collections for crafters.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI throughout several steps.  If I don't already have a color palette and theme decided on, I start there with AI assistance.  I typically will say something like "I am creating a fall themed scrapbooking kit.  Give me an image with some color palette ideas."  I might also upload a color palette I'm going to use and ask AI to give me 10 theme ideas.  Once I have decided on my color palette and theme, I will do some brainstorming work on my own.  After this step, I will go to AI and give it my color palette and theme, then ask it to generate a list of things I could include in a scrapbook kit.  From there, I will use AI to generate inital sketches or ideas for the style I might use for some of the items.  This could look something like telling the AI I'm creating a happy mail themed scrapbook kit with a color palette (I'd upload the image).  I would ask it to create an image with several ideas for stickers or elements I could include.  I typically will have a pretty long conversation with AI where I continue to ask it to generate idea images.  After this step, I go back and look at all the ideas it gave me, and I will take note of what I want to include in my kit.  At this point, I go to my Procreate app and start drawing/creating things.  Occasionally if I am having trouble, I'll have AI create an element of something tricky - like maybe I can't get my squirrel to look like a squirrel.  Once it generates something, I will download one I like and use it as a reference for my artwork.  Once I've completed my kit, I will typically upload it to AI and ask it to tell me what it is missing or what would make it look better.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI is woven throughout almost your entire creative process, from initial ideation all the way through to final review. I'm particularly intrigued by how you use it for that brainstorming conversation where you keep asking for more idea images.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, I actually just began a new kit 2 days ago and had a lengthy conversation with AI.  I first provided my color palette image and theme I had decided on - which was the fall happy mail theme.  I first asked it a more broad request, which was something like "I am creating a fall happy mail themed scrapbooking kit.  Give me an image of a bunch of elements you think would work well for it using these colors."  I then asked it to give me more a few times until there were quite a few to choose from.  It started using the wrong colors at one point, so I refined the results by reminding it that it needs to use only the colors I provided.  Once I had a large selection of ideas, I narrowed it down.  For example, one of the elements it gave me was an owl.  I asked it to provide me with an image of several different owl element designs similar to the one it already gave me.  I did this with any elements I was interested in, like squirrels, cats, mushrooms, foliage, leaves, envelopes, etc.  I then asked it to create a sheet of word art.  I went through the same process, asking it to create more of the types I liked and refine them as needed.  I am currently at the stage of drawing my kit.  While drawing, I will open my conversation with AI to see some of the ideas it gave me and go from there.  Once I'm done drawing everything I think I'll need, I'll create a kit preview myself in Photoshop, then upload an image of it to AI to ask for its feedback on how I can improve it.

AI: That's a really detailed walkthrough - thank you! It sounds like you had quite an extensive back-and-forth with the AI, almost like having a creative brainstorming partner. I'm curious about that dynamic.

When you're working with AI in those long conversations, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It's definitely a collaboration.  I would say I lead the process even though the AI gives me ideas.  I start it out with some guidelines, it provides ideas, then I continue to refine and give feedback.  If the AI provides me with something that isn't the style I'm looking for, wrong theme, wrong colors, nonsense lettering, etc, I always provide it with feedback and get more clear on what I want it to produce.  I think usually we work together well, and it is extremely helpful for me.

AI: That's a great way to put it - you leading the process while working together. It sounds like you've developed a real skill in guiding the AI toward what you're envisioning.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think what has changed most since I started using AI for my design process is that I have a more extensive brainstorming and ideation process, and I end up with more diverse kits as a result.  While I used to just draw my kits with whatever ideas came to mind or maybe adding in some ideas that I found online through othre research, I get a much wider variety, and the AI definitely helps me think of unique ways to present different ideas.  For example, if I tell the AI I want it to show me happy mail stickers, it will likely give me a few I have thought of (or at least similar), but it will also likely give me a few that I would not have thought of, and normally at least one is something really cool that I'd like to put into my designs.  So overall, my creation process is now longer, but it's also more fun I'd say, and my designs are more interesting and varied as a result.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI has actually expanded your creative horizons and made the process more enjoyable, even if it takes longer. It sounds like it's helping you discover ideas you wouldn't have naturally arrived at on your own.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I definitely do have concerns.  There are some designers in my field that will have the AI create elements or stickers that they directly download, extract, and add to their kits.  While I don't think this is necessarily awful, I definitely think it detracts from what I like about art - the fact that someone created that and now I am using it.  I also think that since AI can generate lots of things quickly, people can put together huge packs of elements or other items fast.  Some people just want to make a quick buck, so they upload designs that haven't been well refined.  I've seen this in things I've purchased.  I recently was at a Barnes and Noble and saw a really cool looking coloring book about fairies.  When I was looking at the cover, I noticed the fairy had 5 fingers and a thumb!  These are things that the AI sometimes messes up, and without a human who actually cares to make sure it's accurate, can lead to degraded quality.  I've also bought stickers online only to find similar flaws that someone missed - probably someone quickly batch creating things using AI and not checking things over.  I think that AI participation in the creation of art can definitely take profit away from true artists who are creating work with their hands because people who don't necessarily value true handmade art will buy the cheapest thing, which will definitely be AI generated.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns, and I can hear how much you value the craft and care that goes into creating quality work. It sounds like you're seeing a real tension between AI as a creative tool versus AI as a shortcut that might undermine quality and authentic artistry.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see myself using AI in a similar way to what I do now.  I think what I'd like to see is the AI being able to really help me automate the boring parts of my job.  Creating descriptions (I know it can do this, but I haven't utilized it), maybe uploading listings for me, creating pdf documents with links for customers to download my products.  In a dream scenario, I'd love to use the AI to actually create a customized blog featuring my designs, complete with a shoppable interface.  I'm sure soe of this is possible, but again, I just haven't gone that far with it yet.

AI: That's a really interesting vision - using AI more for the administrative and technical tasks while keeping the creative core in your hands. It sounds like you see AI's potential to free you up to focus more on the actual design work you love.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has expanded your ideation process while you still maintain creative control, and your concerns about quality and authenticity in the field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered it.  Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a collaborative brainstorming partner while maintaining your role as the creative director, along with your thoughtful concerns about quality and authenticity in the field, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you've found that sweet spot of leveraging AI to enhance and expand your creative process without losing what you value most about handcrafted work. Best of luck with your fall happy mail kit!
