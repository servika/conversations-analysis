Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: All good, go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, I use AI most days for work. I frequently consult it on how to pitch to new and existing business partners, ensuring that I'm being appropriately emotionally intelligent and leveraging psychological tools where possible to try to build trust. I also rely on it to create captions and posts for my business and for creativity to generate ideas that might draw an audience. I use it for regulatory information and writing up policies, SOPs and Risk Assessments, complex documents which would take hours to put together from scratch - AI is perfect for those types of otherwise laborious tasks.

AI: That's quite a range of uses. It sounds like you're leveraging AI for both the strategic, relationship-building side of your work and the more administrative documentation tasks.

When you're working on those business pitches and trying to be emotionally intelligent with partners, how do you typically approach that with AI? What does that process look like for you?

User: I would typically ask the model to assume a role, such as an "expert sales person" or "business psychologist" and provide a paragraph of background information before asking it to give me bulleted tips or a rough script to run through.

AI: That's interesting that you set up specific roles for the AI to take on. 

Tell me more about how you use that rough script or those bulleted tips once you get them. Do you follow them pretty closely in your actual conversations, or do they serve more as a starting point for you?

User: I'd much rather use it as a starting point and to generate ideas for me. Scripts work well but I'd struggle to memorise every part of the script. In that sense, with bullet points or a rough script, I can remember key points and bring them into a natural conversation with a business partner, using my own tone and style of speaking

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it to spark ideas and key points rather than trying to follow something word-for-word.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Hmm, there aren't many tasks that I would prefer to handle myself necessarily. I think most of the time AI can offer some good insights if nothing else. There's no risk or hinderance in using AI for all manner of tasks, so why wouldn't you? The most you have lost is a couple of minutes of time, and could potentially gain some interesting insights and viewpoints which you hadn't considered before - It's like sounding something out with an intelligent friend or colleague.

AI: That's a really open approach - treating it like bouncing ideas off an intelligent colleague. 

When you do use AI for these various tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, going back and forth, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and let it handle things independently?

User: I would say that I prefer to give the model a very good background initially. So I'll spend a couple of minutes putting together a good context paragraph, potentially asking the model to assume a role, then bounce back and forth from that point onwards. But for me, it's really key to provide the model with a strong context and role, otherwise the results aren't anywhere near as good as you'd have liked them to be

AI: That preparation phase sounds really important to your process - investing time upfront in setting the context and role to get better results later.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: I'd say using it for spreadsheets and slides is something that I hadn't really thought of before, but colleagues have opened my eyes up to this use of the models

AI: That's interesting that colleagues showed you new ways to use it for things like spreadsheets and slides - applications you hadn't initially considered.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There's no one standout moment, but I'd say that occasionally the models really don't grasp the tone or perspective you're aiming for. Despite a strong context paragraph, sometimes the models just don't quite hit the nail on the head and you end up carrying out the work yourself

AI: That tone mismatch sounds frustrating, especially when you've invested time in setting up that context.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Hmm, I don't feel particularly threatened by AI in my work, but potentially that is due to my work being more hands on and not being a direct threat from AI at the moment. I am however investing in myself and studying a Masters in Sport Psychology, which could definitely be at threat from AI. But even then I feel like because it relies so much on human behavior it will be a long time before AI can converse on deep levels in person (for example within a sport setting) with humans

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - recognizing that the in-person, deep human interaction aspects of sport psychology create a natural buffer against AI replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I aim to continue using AI tools in my work, and learning more and more as it becomes more powerful. I'd love to continue leveraging it and seeing how it incorporates more into our professional lives.

AI: That's all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI like bouncing ideas off an intelligent colleague, and how you've developed that approach of investing time upfront in context-setting to get better results.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, all good, thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner, the importance of role-setting and context, and how colleagues have expanded your thinking about new applications - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
