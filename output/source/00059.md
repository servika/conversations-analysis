Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way through to the final output.

User: I work in green energy, and specifically am a compliance engineer.  I am regularly researching new regulations, codes and standards and assessing how they do (or don't) apply to our product.  When I find a relevant regulation, I then break it down into specific requirements, primarily focused on design requirements.  
After that, I'll review the requirements with appropriate stakeholders and subject matter experts and once we reach a consenus, I will enter the agreed requirements into our requirements management software.  From there I'll support the design and testing team as they implement the regulatory requirements into their design and develop validation plans to demonstrate our products are compliant.  
Once the validation is complete I will collect documentation demonstrating that we meet each requirement and assemble a report and technical file.  With the file completed, I will get the appropriate manager to sign off on a declaration of conformity.  There are other activities related to continuation engineering of products in production, but the bulk of the work is what I described above.

AI: That's really helpful - I can see there are quite a few distinct stages in your compliance process, from the initial research through to that final declaration of conformity.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: A few places.  
1. Giving me summaries of new regulations I am not familiar with
2. Creating cross comparisons of standards that address similar topics, highlighting what the key differences are so we can evaluate them
3. Creating document templates for things like technical files, assessments and other reports
4. Application support for the different software tools I use.

AI: Those are some really interesting applications. Let's dig into one of those - when you're using AI to get summaries of new regulations you're not familiar with, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: When I need to assess a new regulation or standard I am not familiar with, it entails reading the entire document.  These can frequently be 50 to 200 pages long with most of it in technical or legal jargon.  Other options to reading the full document for an inital understanding could include reading industry journals, white papers, or blogs that address the regulation.  However, those are often difficult to find, are not specific to the context of our products, and there is no opportunity to dig in with follow up questions.  AI provides an easier to access, single tool, that addresses several of those shortcomings.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those are substantial documents to work through. When you do use AI for those regulation summaries, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the AI summary is accurate before you act on it?

User: Typically I will use the AI summary to assess whether we need to dig into a particular regulation or standard further.  To ensure the AI is correct, I will ask it to provide references to specific clauses so I can confirm what it is saying matches the text in the standard. I'll fully read the scope, introduction, and selected key clauses for myself and check them against what they AI said.

AI: That's a smart verification approach. Now thinking about the other parts of your compliance process - the ones where you haven't used AI yet - what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: I would love to use AI to read a standard (for example ISO 6469-3), pull out all the design and test requirements from the standard and place those into a template (excel, word, or something similar) so that we can put them into our requirements management system. This is an extensive copy-paste activity normally and takes a lot of time.  Why I don't do that is the few times I've tried it, AI had trouble reading the PDF files correctly, formatting in the output was not done well (data in the wrong fields), and there are licensing concerns with feeding standards under copyright into an AI

AI: Those are significant barriers - the technical limitations around PDF parsing and formatting, plus those copyright concerns with feeding proprietary standards into AI systems. That's really insightful.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: The one I just described

AI: Ah, of course - that requirement extraction process you mentioned. That would clearly save you a lot of time on what sounds like pretty tedious copy-paste work.

Beyond the technical and copyright issues you mentioned, are there any other concerns you'd have if AI could suddenly do that task perfectly? Or would you feel completely comfortable handing that over?

User: Both professional ethics and my personal ethos would demand I validate the AI's work, but if it could do the job competently I would be happy to let it do the bulk of the work while I take on more of a supervisory/quality control role over it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - maintaining that supervisory role while letting AI handle the heavy lifting. 

Those are all my questions - your insights about how you balance efficiency gains with the need for verification, and particularly your thoughts on the copyright barriers to using AI with proprietary standards, were really illuminating. 

Is there anything else about AI in your compliance work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: One other area which is a big strech right now would be do the same sort of thing but on the validation end of the process.  My pie in the sky dream is that I could the design documentation for a particular product (e.g. CAD files, drawings, test reports, material specifications, etc), feed those into an AI and get the AI to assess whether the product design complies or does not comply with a given standard or regulation, and identify the specific gaps where it does not.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - essentially having AI perform compliance gap analysis by comparing your actual design documentation against regulatory requirements. That would be incredibly powerful for your field.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in compliance work - from the copyright limitations with proprietary standards to your thoughtful approach to verification - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering work. The tension between wanting efficiency gains and maintaining professional responsibility came through clearly.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: Bye!

AI: Bye! Thank you again - this was really valuable!
