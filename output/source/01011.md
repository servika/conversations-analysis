Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have any questions. Let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am in sales and marketing, and I use AI for many things. Those things include: writing social media posts, creating captions, creating promotional products, developing brochures and other printed media, writing emails to customers/leads, and even document creation (SOW's, product marketing guidelines, etc)

AI: That's quite a range of tasks you're using AI for across different aspects of sales and marketing. 

When you're working on something like writing emails to customers or creating those SOWs, walk me through what that process typically looks like - are you starting from scratch with AI, or do you usually have some initial ideas or framework that you bring to it?

User: I usually have some ideas already. I will typically write something, and then paste it into AI and ask the AI to make it sound more professional, clever, concise, etc.

AI: That's interesting - so you're starting with your own work and then using AI to refine it. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I never use AI for tasks that involve proprietary information.

AI: That makes sense from a security standpoint. 

Beyond the proprietary information concern, are there other types of work tasks where you think "I want to handle this myself" even when AI could potentially assist? What drives that choice for you?

User: Yes there are. I consider myself a thoughtful, creative writer, and sometimes I feel like what I develop is better than what an AI model would create.

AI: That's a really valuable perspective - trusting your own creative instincts and recognizing when your voice is what's needed.

Can you think of a specific example where you made that choice? A time when you decided to stick with your own writing rather than involving AI?

User: Yes. There is a specific, clever flow of writing/communication that we use to market one of our products. I haven't been able to get AI to adopt this style, so I will use my own work rather than working with AI.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you have a very specific brand voice or communication style that's hard to replicate.

When you do use AI for work tasks like those social media posts or email refinements, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it something and let it handle it independently?

User: I typically go back and forth with it, refining things to make the result as creative and fitting as possible.

AI: So it sounds like it's more of a collaborative process for you - that back-and-forth refinement.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: I work with a wide range of ages. It seems like my older colleagues. do not understand- or care to understand- how to use AI or how it could make their work more efficient and better overall. My younger colleagues tend to use and appreciate more.

AI: That generational divide is really interesting. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had some sales contractors that were acting unprofessionally, and their behavior/talk couldn't really be addressed because our company didn't have any documents addressing that sort of thing. I need to put something together really quickly, and I had limited time in my day for it. I went to AI, and I had a four page document ready in maybe 10 ten minutes. That was very satisfying.

AI: That sounds like a really effective use of AI - getting something important done quickly when time was tight.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I've considered, but it's not something I'm worried about. My sales role will always require a human for face-to-face interaction, facility tours, tradeshows, etc so I feel my job is secure.

AI: That's a practical way to think about it - focusing on those uniquely human aspects of your role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I definitely see my relationship with AI at work evolving. It has made my workflow so much more efficient, which is allowing me to take on extra work that I wouldn't have had time for before. That extra work is only going to require increasing that relationship with AI.

AI: That's a really compelling perspective - AI creating capacity for you to take on more rather than replacing what you do.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has created efficiency that allows you to expand your workload, and that distinction you make between tasks where you trust your own creative voice versus where AI collaboration works well.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative refinement process, the generational differences you've observed, and how AI is enabling you to expand your capacity rather than replace your skills - these will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
