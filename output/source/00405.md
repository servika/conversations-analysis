Assistant: Hello! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you?

User: Sure, ask away!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I often use AI for tasks that do not require a lot of expertise, but are tedious. For example, creating code templates. 
I also use AI as a replacement for google to ask questions about various things I need to know throughout the day.

AI: That's helpful context. When you mention creating code templates, can you walk me through what that looks like? What kind of templates are you typically creating?

User: If I am writing a scraping tool, for example, I would explain the process to the AI in a somewhat detailed format, and use the code created by the AI to then suit my needs. Modern LLMs got better at creating professional code.

AI: Tell me more about how you take that AI-generated code and suit it to your needs. What does that process look like for you?

User: The LLM can give me a template for scraping some items from a website. However, it might make mistakes, or skip something. In those cases, I edit the code and test it.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yeah, mostly debugging tasks. I admit AI has gotten better at such tasks, but I have two primary reasons for doing this myself:
1. To keep sharp.
2. To prevent possible harm, since despite improvements, the LLMs still can't handle some edge cases correctly.

AI: That's really interesting - you mentioned wanting to keep sharp. Can you tell me more about what that means to you? What happens if you don't stay sharp in those areas?

User: I noticed that when using LLMs, people get over-dependent because of the convenience they offer. A year or two of this dependence, and they forget how to do their jobs themselves. 
Furthermore, the constant context switching between the code and the LLM disallows getting into that meditative stance that a coder gets into.

AI: That meditative stance you mentioned - can you describe what that feels like when you're coding without AI? What does that state bring to your work?

User: In that moment, one could focus on the code while at the same time, listen to music, or podcasts. But using LLM requires shifting focuses. This breaks the immersion in code and thus, reduces efficiency.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Collaboration is my go-to, usually.

AI: What does that collaboration look like in practice? Can you walk me through a recent example of how you collaborated with AI on a task?

User: I had this project to make a tool that can convert children's drawings into realistic counterparts. If I were to work on the frontend, it would've taken a lot longer. Instead, I created the business logic, while using LLM to generate a frontend for me.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They don't notice. I don't use it that much.
They do notice I used it in the frontend when I present the prototypes.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied:
The scraping tool I was talking about right now. It handled all the edge cases well. I didn't have to do much.
Frustrated:
I was making a mod for a game. The LLM just couldn't figure it out, despite having access to the documentation.

AI: Tell me more about that frustrating experience with the game mod. What was it about that particular situation that the AI couldn't handle, even with the documentation?

User: The game had a deep JSON structure weaved with the LUA script. The LLM was unable to parse the JSON with LUA.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Sure. It's improving by the day. However, the results seem diminishing.

AI: What do you mean by diminishing results? Can you elaborate on what you're observing?

User: The LLM isn't improving as quick as it used to in 2023. 
Feels like it is reaching an upper limit. I might be wrong though.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that meditative coding state and how context switching with AI can break your immersion.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: None. Thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with maintaining your own skills, and especially your thoughts on the meditative aspects of coding, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
