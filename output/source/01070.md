Assistant: Hi there, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, and I have no questions.

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I haven't found a wide variety of applications for AI in my typical workday yet, although in some specific scenarios it's been very useful. I work as a bookkeeper within a company, and I deal with customer and supplier invoices and statements. We received a supplier statement with several old invoices on it, and the supplier was chasing us to make payment for these. However, because the supplier had allocated credit notes in a different way to us, our ledgers were not matching. Hence, I needed to to do some investigation to see if I could work out if we did owe what the supplier said we owed on their statement. I fed some individual invoice and credit note totals into an AI chatbot, and asked it if any combination of those figures equaled a separate figure that I'd obtained from looking at our ledger. I've asked AI to help me with something similar as well, where we received a payment from a customer and I couldn't work out which invoices were included. I fed the invoice totals to the AI, and asked if any combination of those figures were equal to the total amount paid. I've seen email suggestions from an integrated AI tool, but haven't yet delved into that aspect! So I mainly use AI to help me reconcile figures as part of my bookkeeping.

AI: That's really interesting - you've found a very specific application where AI excels at something that would be quite tedious to do manually. 

When you're working through those reconciliation problems, what does that process typically look like for you? Do you feed all the numbers to the AI at once and ask it to find matches, or is there more back-and-forth as you work through the problem together?

User: Yes, I feed all of the numbers to the AI at once. For some reason I do this as a line separated list (so I put a separate figure on each line), almost as though I don't want to confuse the chatbot! I've just asked something like, "do any combination of these numbers add up to [figure]?" before providing the list, and that's suited my purposes well.

AI: That's fascinating that you format it as a line-separated list - it sounds like you've developed your own intuitive way of communicating clearly with the AI.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your bookkeeping work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different from the reconciliation work you described?

User: Yes, there are some tasks that I prefer to handle myself. I've always taken pride in my writing abilities, so when it comes to writing emails to customers, suppliers and colleagues, I'm reluctant to employ AI to help with this. I think another part of what contributes to this reluctance is that I have a program installed on my computer that checks my grammar and spelling, and on multiple occasions I've disagreed with what the program has suggested. It feels like if I were to delegate writing to AI, I'd lose control over something that I take pride in! I'm also worried that an email recipient would find out that I've used AI and be upset.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like writing is something where you value having your own voice and maintaining that personal touch. 

Tell me more about that concern regarding email recipients finding out you've used AI. What do you think would upset them about that?

User: Yes. I think in general people like to feel valued and heard, and if they were to find out that I'd delegated responding to them to AI, they might have feelings such as 'this person doesn't value me', 'they can't be bothered dealing with me', and potentially even 'they think I'm stupid and don't realize that this is AI'. That might harm our professional relationship.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the relational aspect of communication. It sounds like you see email as more than just information exchange - there's a human connection element that feels important to preserve.

When you use AI for those reconciliation tasks versus handling emails yourself, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like with reconciliation, you delegate the complete task to AI, but I'm wondering if there are other work situations where you find yourself collaborating with AI throughout a task rather than just handing it off entirely?

User: Well, perhaps I need to clarify somewhat. In the example where I was trying to reconcile a payment from a customer, I first had to search up that customer on my accounting software and bring up a list of outstanding invoices and their amounts. I then manually wrote those figures into the AI chat window together with my request. So I suppose it was more of a collaboration than a complete delegation. I do have a task in mind where I expect to collaborate with AI again, but I haven't started it yet.

AI: That clarification is really helpful - you're doing the detective work of gathering the right information, then bringing AI in as a computational partner for the mathematical analysis.

What's that upcoming task where you're expecting to collaborate with AI? I'm curious what makes you think that one will be collaborative as well.

User: Well, I've been asked to put together a spreadsheet where I list repeat orders from customers who order certain products from us. The reason for this project is so that we can make decisions about whether to order certain products in bulk from our suppliers, hence reducing unit costs and increasing our profit margin. My plan is to collate the raw data manually, but then ask AI to read the data and make suggestions as to which orders should be ordered in bulk. I suppose I'll be asking AI to produce an action plan. It just feels like it will save time as opposed to me writing it myself.

AI: That sounds like a really strategic use of AI - letting it process your carefully gathered data to identify patterns and recommendations. It's interesting how you're positioning AI as the analyst while you handle the data collection.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you discussed these kinds of applications with others, or is this something you've been exploring on your own?

User: I haven't discussed AI much with my colleagues, although I know that a few of them subscribe to premium AI tools, so they are using it. I once received an email from a colleague where I thought, 'this doesn't sound like them, it sounds like AI!', which I suppose contributed to my reluctance to use AI for writing. Our workplace has recently purchased a subscription to a premium AI product that integrates into many of our existing software programs, so I expect that over time we may as a company increase our usage of AI.

AI: That's really insightful - you've actually experienced firsthand that moment of recognizing AI-generated content, which seems to reinforce your preference for keeping your writing authentic.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, as I mentioned before, I've only really used it to help me with reconciliation so far. I felt satisfied after having used AI for this, because I know it saved me a decent amount of time versus trying different combinations of invoice totals myself!

AI: That satisfaction from saving time on such a tedious task makes perfect sense. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially as your workplace starts integrating more AI tools?

User: I've spent enough time with AI to know that in its current form, it's still very susceptible to errors and hallucinations. I feel that it's important to maintain my bookkeeping knowledge and skills, because even if AI starts playing a more prominent role in my day-to-day tasks, I think its work will still need monitoring, to make sure it isn't making mistakes.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing AI as a tool that needs oversight rather than a replacement. It sounds like your professional expertise becomes even more valuable as a way to quality-check AI's work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding beyond reconciliation and analysis tasks, or staying within those boundaries you've established?

User: I feel that if AI progresses in its writing abilities, I may gradually acquiesce and start using it to help me with composing the odd email here and there. Perhaps if an AI were able to study my own writing style and emulate it to a reasonable degree, I would feel more at ease using it, because I'd be less worried about it coming across as 'robotic' in its writing! I'm also very open to seeing how AI evolves and assessing whether additional opportunities will arise for integration into my bookkeeping role.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the relational aspects of communication influence your AI usage decisions, and your practical approach to using AI as a computational partner while maintaining oversight.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I wouldn't say so; I think I've mentioned everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that sweet spot between leveraging AI's computational strengths while preserving the human elements that matter in professional relationships will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were about the nuances of when and how you choose to integrate AI into your work. Have a great rest of your day!
