Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great let's go

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Yep, so I work writing show notes for podcasts and I find AI great at either improving what I've written or helping me come up with gripping engaging content (specifically titles). I'll use AI throughout the day as I work on different deliverables either at the start of working on that particular deliverable or right at the end to improve what I've written. I mainly use AI for two different tasks. One is to help me with creativity when I get 'stuck', and the other is to rewrite text to make it flow better or sound more gripping/engaging.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI serves as both a creative partner and an editor for you. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yep, a lot of podcast producers use AI to create the timestamps and 'what we've talked about section'. They use AI to convert the audio into a transcript and then use another AI to convert this transcript into the show notes. I prefer to handle this myself because I can't trust the AI to not miss something important or to correctly extract the correct information. I also really enjoy this part of the process of my work so although it would be more efficient to use AI it would take away from the part I love most about my job (listening to the episode) and the output wouldn't be quite as high quality as if I do it myself. I think when getting a AI to create the key points in this way it is about 90% as good as if I do it myself but does take minutes as oppose to about a hour

AI: That's fascinating - you've identified a clear trade-off between efficiency and both quality and job satisfaction. It sounds like there's real value in that hour of deep listening for you.

When you do use AI for those creative and editing tasks you mentioned, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It's definitely a collaborative process throughout the task. A typical pattern would be me writing a brief description of the episode along with a outline of the type of title I want followed by asking the AI to give me 5 suggested titles, I would then pick one out of the suggestions and maybe edit it a little. I would then write the entire show notes and copy and paste the finished show notes and ask the AI to improve the content, make it flow better, make it more engaging, and remove any unnecessary fluff. I would then assess the changes it made and add in any that seemed appropriate to the original. I might also get stuck on how to write a particular segment (this is when I find AI the most useful) as I can write something awfully and get the AI to make it adequate.

AI: That's a really clear picture of how you work together - it sounds like you maintain creative control while using AI as a thinking partner and refinement tool.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: That's a good question. Some colleagues are adamant at keeping the show notes as a human centred process, they don't want me to use AI and although it is fine for me to use it, it is better that I keep them unaware that I am using it. The workplace culture is moving towards using AI more and more and some processes now are done more or less completely by AI but as I said there is pushback in certain areas by certain people and creators.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like there's some tension between efficiency gains and maintaining human authenticity in the creative process. The fact that you sometimes keep your AI use private suggests there are some complex dynamics at play.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: In terms of when I felt particularly satisfied to be honest that's with almost every interaction I have specifically in Title creation. For example, I couldn't think of an adequate title that would hit SEO while also sound interesting and engaging to the listener. I wrote some frankly awful titles and put these as well as a description of the episode into the AI and it immediately gave me a top class title I could use with only a little editing. If I didn't have this tool it probably would have taken me another 10/15 minutes of deep creativity when it instead took one minute of easy work.

To be honest, I don't think it ever leaves me feeling frustrated as I can always get a helpful output if I structure my prompts correctly.

AI: That's a great example - saving 10-15 minutes of mental effort while getting a better result sounds incredibly valuable, especially for something as specific as balancing SEO with engagement.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I consider it but more in terms of those skills becoming somewhat obsolete or maybe just changing in the type of skill that's needed. AI is becoming better and better everyday and so the skill of coming up with gripping titles (for example) is less important for me to have and instead I need to have the skill of creating an effective prompt and reviewing/editing the titles the AI produces. Undoubtably, my skills of title creation are decreasing as I don't practice this skill but the skill is almost becoming obsolete anyway.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about skill evolution - recognizing that the core competency is shifting from direct creation to effective collaboration and curation. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Sadly, I think my job will be almost completely replaced by AI in the next year or 2. Instead of having me manage 10 podcasts, I will be able to manage 100 or more by using AI to write the entirety of the show notes and me just reviewing the material. In reality, this means that I will probably lose my job as instead of needing 10 show notes writers the industry will only need 1 (in the example of 100 podcasts). Therefore, I believe my relationship with AI at work will cease to exist as I lose my job, however whoever stays in this field will undoubtedly have to have a deep relationship with AI as they become more of a 'AI output reviewer' and less of a show notes writer.

AI: That's a remarkably candid and thoughtful perspective on what's clearly a significant personal and professional challenge. It sounds like you're seeing this transformation happening in real time.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how skills are evolving rather than just disappearing, and your honest assessment of the industry changes you're witnessing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really, although I should mention that some clients have already made this transition to relying on AI for their shownotes and not using a writer at all but just having the producer review the AIs output.

AI: That's a crucial detail - it really confirms what you were saying about the industry transformation already being underway. It sounds like you're observing the shift from the inside as it happens.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI work, the skill evolution you're experiencing, and especially your candid perspective on the industry changes will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. 

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've reflected on both the immediate benefits and the longer-term implications of AI in your field.
