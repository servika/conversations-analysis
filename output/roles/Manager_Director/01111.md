Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Fire away!

AI: Great! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I create content for my blog (writing in Wordpress), my YouTube channel (filming in OBS and editing in Adobe Premiere), and also for my church as Creative Director (lots of graphics in Canva).  For the YouTube, a typical project is storyboarding the video, shooting the footage, editing, then prepping thumbnails, writing descriptions and titles, etc. For the blog, I'm outlining the content, writing it up, and integrating images and video. For church, it can be anything from sermon graphics to social images, planning and edition short-form video, etc.

AI: That's quite a diverse creative portfolio you've got there! It sounds like you're juggling multiple formats and audiences across your blog, YouTube channel, and church work.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I don't reach for AI a lot, but I guess you could count Grammarly suggestions for writing. I also use VidIQ and YouTube's AI tools to assist me with refining my video descriptions and titles.

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like you're using AI more in the refinement and optimization stages rather than in the initial creative conception. 

Tell me more about that experience with VidIQ and YouTube's AI tools for your video descriptions and titles. How does that process work for you?

User: I get so overwhelmed with all the "noise" on the internet and changing trends. Having an engine to keep up with algorithms, feature changes, and trends to point those details in the right direction is helpful. I still make sure the "bones" are authentically me, but being able to A/B test or use an AI checklist to score my work keeps me honest and up with the times.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to put it - using AI to help navigate the "noise" while keeping the authentic "bones" of your work intact. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used these AI tools? What role did they play, and how did that feel for you as you were working through it?

User: For a recent YouTube video, I did a side-by-side comparison between two different hair gels. I wrote up the description, but I was struggling with a catchy title (as I often do). I used VidIQ's Optimize features to get recommendations for titles and test refinements to my description and determine what keywords to focus on.

AI: That's a great example. So you had your content and description ready, but got stuck on the title - something a lot of creators struggle with.

When you're using VidIQ's recommendations for titles and keyword optimization, how would you describe that collaboration? Are you feeling like you're in the driver's seat making the creative decisions, or does it feel more like the AI is guiding the direction?

User: I definitely feel like AI is guiding the direction, which is the part I feel uneasy about. The AI feels like it is concerned with what will make successful (not a bad thing at all), but not necessarily with maintaining my voice.

AI: That tension you're describing is really fascinating - wanting the success that AI optimization can bring, but feeling uneasy about potentially losing your authentic voice in the process.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using these AI tools? Have you noticed any shifts in how you approach your projects or think about your content?

User: Honestly, I am less in tune with industry standards, so to speak. Before AI, I dedicated more time to researching what was changing with social media, keeping up with new features, etc. Now, I somewhat trust AI to know that kind of stuff for me and let me know through the refinement process.

AI: That's such an insightful observation - that AI has essentially become your industry research assistant, which has freed you from that constant monitoring but also created some distance from those trends.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Number 1: Abuse of intellectual property. I see so much deep faking and manipulation of media. I love humankind, but we are famous for taking positive things and using them negatively. Works get stolen and used without attribution or permission. Or people's likenesses get used in placed where it shouldn't... Number 2: It makes the world smaller and bigger at the same time, and that influences the breadth of work that gets created. For example, before the internet, just about everything that was created was born out of the human experience. They traveled places, tried new things, met new people...and then they wrote about it. Drew it. Photographed it. The list goes on. AI certainly makes some things more accessible, but it also mimics the known instead of encouraging people to seek the unknown. How do we grow from that? If AI can only do what we train it to do, it's limited to what we know. I'm afraid that some of the discovery that drives expression could be lost.  AI should be a supplement to the stages of the creative process, not a substitute.

AI: Those are really profound concerns, and I appreciate how thoughtfully you've articulated them. The tension between AI making things more accessible while potentially limiting us to "the known" rather than encouraging discovery of "the unknown" is particularly striking.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Given these concerns you've shared, how are you thinking about navigating that balance?

User: I'm exploring time-saving functions, such as using Opus Clip to grab shorts from a two-hour church service. I also would love to level up  some of my video editing. However, I'm making a conscious effort to continue my education, so I'm using AI as a true assistant and not crutch. Furthermore, expanding my skills will help me to maximize AI's capabilities when I do use them through better prompt writing and such. I am committed to supplying the "raw data" - my writing in my style and my images and videos from my perspective. There's a whole group of people counting on me to do that.

AI: That's a really compelling approach - using AI as a "true assistant and not crutch" while staying committed to providing that authentic "raw data" from your unique perspective. The responsibility you feel to the people counting on your authentic voice really comes through.

Those are all the questions I had prepared, but you've shared some incredibly thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I'm particularly struck by your distinction between using AI for optimization and industry knowledge while maintaining ownership of the creative "bones," and your commitment to continued learning so AI enhances rather than replaces your skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I really hope that cultural competency remains important in the development of creative AI. As a Black woman, representation in the physical world has always been an issue, along with such things as colorism, texturism, and featurism. I have to admit that early AI has not done a great job of handling these things well. For example, if I plug my photo into an image generator/manipulators, O

AI: I can see your message got cut off there, but what you've started to share about cultural competency and representation in AI is incredibly important. The issues you're highlighting around colorism, texturism, and featurism, and how early AI has struggled with these - that's such a critical perspective that needs to be part of these conversations.

Would you like to finish that thought about what happens when you use image generators or manipulators?

User: Yes -sorry. For example, if I plug my photo into an image generator/manipulators, I can all but guarantee that my skin will be lightened, my hair texture will be loosened, my eyes might come back lighter, nose slimmer, and my body will probably be smaller. In a world where so many people get their body image expectations from the internet, it's dangerous for an AI engine to send the message that the ideal is anything and everything BUT what you are. Text is become less mockingly stereotypical, but there's still work to be done.

AI: Thank you for sharing that - and for finishing that thought. What you're describing is so important and really highlights how AI systems can perpetuate and amplify existing biases in ways that have real psychological and cultural impact, especially around beauty standards and representation.

The fact that you can "all but guarantee" these changes when using image tools speaks to how deeply embedded these biases are in current AI systems. And your point about people getting body image expectations from the internet makes the stakes of this even clearer.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly, including that crucial perspective on representation and cultural competency. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with authentic voice, the concerns about limiting discovery, and especially the need for better representation in AI development - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to share these thoughtful reflections with me today.

User: Thank you!

AI: You're so welcome! Thank you again for being such a thoughtful and open participant. Your insights were really valuable, and I learned a lot from hearing about your experiences. Take care!
