Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good and I understand!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: On a very occasional basis (like less than once per week) I'll use an AI assistant to help draft or check my correspondence via DM or email with an advertiser or collaborator at my social media job. I don't often use AI to draft these messages because I worry that if a partner or advertiser checks my message using one of those AI detector websites like Quillbot that they'll feel as though I'm not being professional, or that they're not talking to a real human.

Additionally, I sometimes use AI tools in the video editing software I regularly use for work. Occasionally I need to blur faces in videos for anonymization purposes and AI tools like face trackers can be useful for that.

AI: That's really interesting - you've touched on something I'd love to explore more. You mentioned worrying about AI detectors and how partners might perceive AI-drafted messages. 

Tell me more about that concern. How does that worry influence the way you decide whether or not to use AI for communication tasks?

User: I often decide not to use AI to draft my messages because of that concern. In fact, I'll typically only use AI to draft my messages if I'm reasonably confident that the collaborator or advertiser I'm communicating with is using AI to draft their messages. I don't really have much justification for this degree of circumspection; I've never had an issue with somebody confronting me or terminating a deal or partnership because they suspected I was using AI. It's just something I worry will seem unprofessional, because sometimes I feel myself that when partners use AI to communicate with me that it's slightly unprofessional.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - this sense that AI communication might feel unprofessional, even though you acknowledge it's more of a feeling than something based on actual negative experiences.

When you do sense that a partner is using AI to communicate with you, what specifically makes it feel that way to you? What are the telltale signs or qualities that give you that impression?

User: Good question. I'd say overuse of emojis in a message (this is more common in social media DMs) as well as highly sensitive, reassuring, or sentimental language is a telltale sign for me. For example, highly expressive language like "we're absolutely delighted" "we're overjoyed" "we can hardly wait" feels a little artificial in certain contexts.

I'll say that for my job I often communicate with company representatives based in China and overseas, and it seems for these companies especially it's very common to send messages that seem either drafted or translated by AI, with very repetitive use of certain phrases, punctuation, and emojis. In this context I don't have any issue with it, and I'm generally just grateful that AI is available to help us bridge the language barrier and open up opportunities that otherwise might not have been available.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you've made - how context shapes your perception of AI use. The language barrier situation versus domestic partnerships seems to create very different feelings for you about AI communication.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones where you're more comfortable using AI assistance?

User: When it comes to video editing, I'm comfortable using AI-assistance tools for very repetitive and non-creative tasks like tracking a subject, animating or panning/zooming using keyframes, that kind of thing. For more creative tasks and fine-grained tasks like color editing, most sound editing, and cuts/transitions, I prefer to do that myself even though an AI or AI-assistance tool might make it easier.

As far as communication tasks go, I generally prefer to handle those myself, unless there are clear signs that whomever I'm communicating with is okay with having AI assist our conversation.

For research tasks, I'll sometimes use AI to provide a general idea, but I always triple check any specific claims because I don't really trust AI to provide reliable and comprehensive research at this stage in its development.

AI: That's a clear pattern - you seem to draw the line between repetitive, mechanical tasks versus creative or nuanced work. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I rarely collaborate, not necessarily because of any preferences one way or the other but just because I'm not sure how I'd integrate a more collaborative workflow into my specific tasks. The video editing software I use makes it about as easy as clicking a button to have AI track a subject or animate a scene, so that work is very delegative. For research, I'll sometimes have an AI tool like ChatGPT write up a report with sources when I'm exploring how successful a given product is likely to be in a new market, but I don't collaborate beyond that: I check the sources and then use those as a jumping off point for further research, which I conduct myself.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like your workflow is more about discrete handoffs rather than ongoing back-and-forth.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any discussion about AI use policies, or have you picked up on attitudes from others that have shaped your approach?

User: My social media work is freelance. It keeps me busy and there are specific partners I regularly communicate with, but there isn't really an established workplace culture since I'm running everything myself. I've noticed an attitude of increasing acceptance towards AI use within the social media ecosystem at large, but there's still a general disdain for interactions that feel "artificial" or disingenuous. AI seems to be more readily accepted when it doesn't feel like it's being used to try and sell you something, if that makes sense.

AI: That definitely makes sense - there's a distinction between AI as a behind-the-scenes tool versus AI that feels like it's directly interfacing with people in a sales context.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time I used an AI tool in the video editing software I regularly use, I was surprised by how good of a job it did tracking the subject's face and applying effects. That felt satisfying, because it saved so much time versus my typical workflow.

Sometimes when I'm using AI to troubleshoot issues with my video editing software or even to troubleshoot other issues - like accessing certain social media analytics tools - it's very frustrating because the AI will be referencing information that is outdated or doesn't seem to exist. The high degree of certitude that an AI assistant will use to communicate information that is objectively incorrect can make the interaction feel very frustrating. To be fair, this is also true in contexts where real humans are being used for tech support or to provide troubleshooting help.

AI: That confidence in delivering incorrect information does sound particularly frustrating - especially when you're trying to solve a time-sensitive problem.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's something I actively worry about. I'm not sure this is relevant, but before my current job I worked as a copywriter for small online retailers. My job mostly consisted of using SEO techniques to write posts for these companies' blogs so that they would appear more highly on various search engines, and I took pride in doing a good job writing blogs that were engaging and well-researched. That was one of the first industries to change dramatically when LLMs became accessible and reliable enough to essentially do the work I was doing. 

I worry, likewise, that the skillset I've acquired with video editing, as well as doing social media promotion and analytics, is going to become redundant in the same way that my SEO and prose-writing skills became redundant. Part of the reason I've sought to work freelance instead of with a particular agency is to maintain professional contacts and to situate myself so that I'm a person who is known for using these tools effectively. I don't want to be replaceable.

AI: That experience with copywriting gives you a very personal perspective on how quickly industries can shift. The strategy of positioning yourself as someone who uses these tools effectively rather than competing against them sounds thoughtful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision it changing dramatically, though I'm not sure exactly how yet. I hope that AI tools are integrated into video editing software to the point where I can give higher level instructions, as opposed to only deploying AI tools for very specific tasks. Likewise, I hope that these tools become more customizable. If I could further refine an AI assistant's "voice" when communicating with partners and advertisers, I'd feel more comfortable using it regularly for communication tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your experience with SEO copywriting has shaped your current approach - that firsthand experience with industry disruption really adds depth to how you're thinking about positioning yourself now.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Hmm, I can't really think of anything. I feel our conversation has just about covered it.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution from copywriting to social media work, the nuances around professional communication, and how you're strategically positioning yourself in a changing landscape will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candor about both the practical benefits and the genuine concerns you have about AI in your work. Take care!
