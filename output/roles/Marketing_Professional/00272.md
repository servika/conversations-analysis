Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I am ready for the interview.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to draft emails to communicate with other businesses that we have to deal with. I often use AI to summarize the contracts we have with other businesses or to extract specific information from those contracts. I run a fast food business so sometimes I also ask AI for some creative work, such as marketing plans or coming up with new menu items.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of uses - from the more administrative side with emails and contracts to the creative aspects like marketing and menu development. 

When you're working on those contract summaries or extractions, how do you typically approach that? Do you feed the AI the entire contract and ask for what you need, or do you have a different process?

User: I feed the entire contract or multiple documents in some cases. I can give you two recent examples where I used AI to extract information from the contracts. One is when I realized that our energy provider increased our bills without notifying us when we had a contract with a fixed price for 3 years. I uploaded the contract document and the latest invoices to an AI model to find out any issues, and it did find the issues where the energy company violated the contract by increasing the energy prices before the 3 years.
Another example is when I needed to find out if there is an option to pause the payments for one of our business contractors, or if it's possible to delay some payments, and AI helped me extract that information from the contract.

AI: Those are really compelling examples - it sounds like AI helped you catch a contract violation that you might have otherwise missed, and potentially saved you money in both cases.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, currently, I handle all the accounting tasks myself, where I manually organize and categorize all the invoices and receipts before I send them to my accountant. I believe if, in some way, I can digitalize all the receipts and invoices, AI can help me classify all the documents, but digitalizing so many documents feels like a hassle.

AI: That makes sense - the digitization step feels like a barrier even though you can see the potential value AI could bring to the categorization work.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task. For example, when I ask to draft an email, I have to proofread the entire email and tell AI to fix or remove parts from the email. Earlier, I gave an example of using contracts to fix the energy bills. In that situation, I had to collaborate as well by uploading multiple documents in different turns to give more context to the AI. I think I can delegate creative tasks, such as coming up with an ad campaign, to the AI, but again, I will have to collaborate by providing more context, such as my target audience and demographics in my restaurant area.

AI: That collaborative approach seems to be central to how you work with AI - you're actively guiding and refining rather than just handing things off completely.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Well, it hasn't changed much for my colleagues as it's a fast-food restaurant. My colleagues deal with the customers, and I am the only one who handles administrative tasks, so I am the one dealing with AI. I see in the future there is a potential to help my colleagues by integrating AI into the workflow. For example, I can integrate AI into online food orders, and AI can help us sort and group the orders that we should prepare together and send in the same direction instead of figuring it out ourselves by checking each address manually.

AI: That's a practical vision for how AI could help optimize your operations. It sounds like you're in a unique position as the business owner handling the administrative side while your team focuses on customer service.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Like I told you earlier, AI really helped us fix our energy contract and save us money that would have been an impossible task for me if I tried it myself, as there is difficult writing in the contracts for a layman like me to understand. The frustration comes when AI goes off the rails and forgets the context of the situation, and I have to start over. I often need to translate documents, and more often than not, I have to keep reminding AI to communicate with me in English and only draft the emails in my specified language.

AI: That contrast is really telling - the energy contract situation where AI handled complex legal language you wouldn't have been able to navigate alone, versus the frustration when it loses track of your instructions about language preferences.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think of AI as a threat but as a useful tool to assist us and help us. My work at a restaurant requires manual labor, and to automate that manual part would be extremely expensive because I would need robots. The administrative side of the operation can be handled using AI, and it makes my life easier. Instead of sitting down and dealing with emails all day, now it takes me a few minutes to get the emails summarized and respond using AI. I don't see AI taking over in my field of work anytime soon.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - you're seeing AI as complementing rather than replacing the core aspects of your business.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it as becoming an essential tool in my workflow. Instead of spending hours dealing with all the administrative stuff, it will take me minutes with the help of AI. It will help me in the long run.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a complement to your core business operations rather than a replacement, and how that energy contract example really demonstrated AI's value in handling complex tasks you wouldn't tackle alone.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool in a small business context, especially the practical examples with contracts and the vision for streamlining operations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
