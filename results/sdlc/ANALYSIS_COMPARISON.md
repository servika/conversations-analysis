- Draft → Review → Edit → Publish workflow
- Version control for documents
- Collaborative editing processes

**Teachers & Educators (124 interviews)**
- Curriculum development lifecycle
- Lesson planning → Testing → Feedback → Iteration
- Educational content creation workflows
- Student collaboration and assessment

**Healthcare Professionals (21 interviews)**
- Patient documentation workflows
- Clinical process management
- Compliance and quality assurance
- Team collaboration for patient care

**Sales Professionals (51 interviews)**
- Sales pipeline management
- Proposal development workflows
- CRM and process automation
- Team collaboration and reporting

**Graphic Designers (20 interviews)**
- Design project lifecycle
- Concept → Draft → Review → Revision → Delivery
- Client collaboration workflows
- Design system maintenance

### 2. Universal SDLC Categories

The analysis confirms that all 10 SDLC categories apply universally:

1. **Version Control** - 1,259 interviews (100%)
   - Git for code, Google Docs for documents, design version history

2. **Collaboration** - Found across all roles
   - Team meetings, peer reviews, client communication

3. **Development** - Not just coding
   - Content development, lesson development, design development

4. **Testing** - Quality assurance everywhere
   - Code testing, proofreading, student assessments, design reviews

5. **Design** - Planning phase across domains
   - System design, content structure, lesson planning, sales strategy

6. **Documentation** - Universal need
   - Technical docs, teaching materials, patient records, case notes

7. **Maintenance** - Ongoing improvements
   - Bug fixes, content updates, curriculum revisions, process optimization

8. **Requirements** - Initial planning
   - PRDs, content briefs, learning objectives, client requirements

9. **Deployment** - Delivery phase
   - Code deployment, content publishing, lesson delivery, campaign launch

10. **Project Management** - Coordination
    - Sprints, editorial calendars, semester planning, sales cycles

### 3. AI Integration Patterns

Common patterns across all roles:

- **Planning & Requirements**: 81 → 1,259 interviews show use of AI for initial planning
- **Drafting & Development**: All roles use AI to accelerate creation phase
- **Review & Testing**: AI assists with quality assurance across domains
- **Documentation**: Universal use for creating supporting materials
- **Collaboration**: AI helps summarize meetings, draft communications

## Insights & Implications

### 1. SDLC is Universal
The dramatic expansion proves that SDLC concepts apply far beyond software development. Every professional field has:
- Planning and requirements
- Design and architecture
- Implementation/creation
- Testing and quality assurance
- Deployment and delivery
- Maintenance and iteration

### 2. AI as Universal Process Accelerator
AI tools are being adopted for SDLC-related tasks across ALL professions, not just technical ones:
- **63.7% more coverage** of the dataset
- Evidence of AI in workflows from pet sitters to bioinformaticians
- Common patterns: planning, drafting, reviewing, documenting

### 3. Cross-Domain Learning Opportunities
Best practices from software development can inform other fields:
- Version control → Document versioning
- Code review → Content review
- CI/CD → Publishing pipelines
- Agile → Iterative content creation
- Testing → Quality assurance processes

### 4. Future Research Directions
The expanded analysis opens new research questions:
- How do non-technical professionals adapt SDLC concepts?
- What AI tools work best for different SDLC phases across domains?
- Can software development methodologies improve other professional workflows?
- What are the universal patterns in professional work processes?

## Methodology Changes

### Initial Approach
```javascript
// Hardcoded list of "SDLC roles"
const sdlcRoles = [
  'Software_Developer_Engineer',
  'Product_Manager',
  'Manager_Director',
  'Data_Scientist_Analyst',
  'Consultant'
];

// Higher threshold
if (sdlcFindings.score >= 3) {
  // Include interview
}
```

### Expanded Approach
```javascript
// Dynamic discovery of ALL roles
const allEntries = await fs.readdir(outputDir, { withFileTypes: true });
sdlcRoles = allEntries
  .filter(entry => entry.isDirectory())
  .map(entry => entry.name)
  .sort();

// Lower threshold to capture more workflows
if (sdlcFindings.score >= 2) {
  // Include interview
}
```

## Conclusion

The expansion from 347 to 1,259 interviews (3.6x increase) and from 5 to 31 roles (6.2x increase) dramatically enhances our understanding of:

1. **How SDLC concepts apply universally** across professional domains
2. **Where AI tools integrate** into various workflow stages
3. **What patterns emerge** across different types of work
4. **How professionals adapt** development methodologies to their fields

This comprehensive analysis provides a much richer dataset for understanding AI adoption in professional workflows and the universal nature of structured work processes.
