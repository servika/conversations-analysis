Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No.

AI: Great, let's get started then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm an artist and writer. 
Artist: I use a free AI image creator to give me basic visual references specific to the idea for a painting I have in my head. For instance, this week I asked the image creator to  make an image of "an old cowboy in profile, riding along a canyon wall in winter time. Long shadows are cast on the snow behind him, seeming to form the shape of a ghostly woman on a horse following him". I then repeat/refine this prompt until the AI gives me an image with the composition placements I had in mind. Then I begin the painting with a rough sketch based on the generated image. I use my own references or photographs as visual references at that point, because I do not need or want AI creative influence.
I also frequently use an AI chat bot to help me evaluate, compare, and purchase tools and art supplies, or to tell me what specific pigment is in a certain brand's color. For example, "what colors can I use as a substitute for Liquitex Green Gold (PY129)?". An AI chat bot is a great tool in these cases because artist supplies and color theory are very complex, nuanced, and subjective categories.
Writer: As a writer, an AI chat bot has been great for researching the type of speculative fiction stories I write. I am able to ask very specific questions, like "what might you call a female navigator's job on a ship in old Nordic culture" and get back lots of suggestions grounded in that culture's language and customs. I have also used an AI chat bot as a preliminary content editor, to answer questions about pacing or plot points, etc. Because the bot knows details about me and what I'm writing, the responses are very tailored to me. Again, as with painting, I do not need or want AI's help creatively, and so I have never asked an AI to write any part of my story for me. Why would I? That's the fun part!

AI: That's really fascinating how you've found such specific ways to integrate AI into both your artistic practices while maintaining clear boundaries around the creative work itself.

Tell me more about that boundary you mentioned - where you draw the line between using AI for support versus keeping the creative work to yourself. How did you figure out where to draw those lines?

User: For writing, the line is pretty clear to me. I might ask a bot to generate character name suggestions, or whether they think my main character is likeable in my opening scene. I treat it like I was having a conversation with a friend, advisor, or expert in the field. I ask them questions, and I might even ask for feedback about a specific chapter or story element, but I am the author. I am writing the story. If I had AI do it, not only would this be "cheating", it would defeat the main purpose of why I write in the first place: self-expression.
As for painting, the line is a bit more blurry to explain. If I spent hours and hours refining generated images of my painting idea prompts, I would inevitably get further and further away from the "spark" of inspiration I had in the first place. When I first tried an AI image creator for this use, that is exactly what happened. I generated probably hundreds of images, and got caught up in the new-ness of being able to make exactly what I had in my head. By the time I had it "perfect", I was pretty far from my original idea, and I actually never ended up painting the piece. All the life and fun and inspiration had been drained away by the process. So now, if I don't get a "close enough" reference within a few tries, I stop and just use what I can from what I got, and move on to making my own visual references through photography. I never let the AI influence my style. The generated images are about layout and proportion, just as I would use traditional photo references.

AI: That experience you described with generating hundreds of images and losing the original spark is really striking. It sounds like you learned something important about how the tool could actually work against your creative process if you used it too much.

When you say you treat the AI like having a conversation with a friend or advisor for your writing - how does that feel different from when you might actually talk to a real friend or mentor about your work?

User: Well, with an AI chat bot I am not seeking validation or connection as I would be with a friend or advisor. (So far, anyway lol.) A bot lacks the means to contribute in a meaningful way like that; in a human way. For instance, my friend might reply with a comparison to a story they once wrote. A bot could reply in a way that pretends to be like a human with memories or life-experience, but it will always fall flat because I know that it doesn't actually have that.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making - using AI for its technical knowledge but not expecting that human element of shared experience or genuine validation.

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI for one of these research questions? Like when you asked about substitutes for that specific paint color - how does that conversation usually unfold?

User: I was at my local craft store and I told my chat bot that they were out of Liquitex Green Gold, and asked if there was a color there that would be similar enough for me to use instead.

The bot showed me a swatch of the exact color I was asking about, and then broke down what pigments made that color. In this case, a single pigment makes of Liquitex's Green Gold: Copper Azomethine (PY129). The bot gave me a quick summary of its color properties (transparent, high pigment strength, great for glazing) and common use in color mixing, like botanical greens and earthy yellows. The bot then suggested to similar colors from two other brands, included their pigment makeup, and also told me what pigments I could mix if those were also unavailable.

I checked the store's stock, and they were out of the alternatives. I told the bot this and told them the only other pro artist acrylics in the store were Golden brand.

The bot then suggested that I use Golden's Green Gold, which is a mixture of two pigments (PY150 and PG36) but will almost certainly be a close enough match for finishing up the leaves on the painting I was working on. 

I asked the bot about the difference between Golden's high flow vs. fluid acrylics, and purchased thicker one. I went home and finished my painting. The color was indeed a near perfect match.

AI: That's such a practical example of how the AI's technical knowledge really worked for you in the moment. It sounds like it gave you exactly the level of detail you needed to make a good decision on the spot.

When you're using AI this way - whether for paint questions or research for your writing - how do you decide whether to trust the information it's giving you? Do you ever double-check it, or has it generally been reliable enough that you take it at face value?

User: The more subjective the question the more I double-check, with the writing advice. Just like I might get a real-world second opinion. I have put the bot through a lot to test its knowledge, and regarding color theory, which is science, it has been spot-on so far. I think I would say that the higher the consequences a mis-informed response would yield, the more likely I am to double-check it. I am at expert/professional level in both fields, so I can usually tell if a response is off, and chase down a correction. I have ADHD and the short-term memory problems that goes with that. It can be debilitating, and I also can't hold such a massive amount of detailed knowledge in my own brain all the time, expertise or no. The AI chat bot acts like a second brain and personal assistant, something that would otherwise be out of reach for me financially, as an independent creative.

AI: That insight about AI serving as a "second brain and personal assistant" is really valuable, especially how you describe it helping with the memory challenges that come with ADHD. It sounds like it's filling a very practical need that would be expensive to address otherwise.

How have your colleagues or peers in the art and writing communities responded to your use of AI tools? Has their reaction influenced how you approach using these tools at all?

User: Absolutely. I keep myself up to date on how AI art is impacting the artist community. Reading about and hearing from others negative experience with AI art has taught me to use a lot of caution, and to use the image generator with intention and care. I look forward to legislation that will protect artists and prevent the theft of their work. I do not believe that "AI artists" are a thing. Brandon Sanderson said a lot I agree with. To paraphrase, he said people who call themselves "AI artists" are AI art directors of a machine, at best. He has done the real-life equivalent of giving "prompts" to his book cover artists, through extremely specific instructions and feedback from the start to the finish the piece. At the end, the artist has painted exactly what he wanted, but it would be ludicrous (and theft, and unethical) if Sanderson claimed that he himself was the cover artist.
I'm not as plugged in to the writing side of the issue, but I do know that many are already feeling negative impacts.
I would love to be a part of seeing humanity's way through strengthening the great positives of AI and guarding against the negatives.

AI: You've brought up something really important there - this tension between the practical benefits you're finding and the broader concerns about AI's impact on creative communities. The Brandon Sanderson analogy about art direction versus creation is particularly striking.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: As a creative with ADHD, I get frequently frustrated with my chat bot's insistence on ending nearly every response with a suggestion of the next direction to take in the conversation. "If you'd like help selecting specific shade names from Michaels' current inventory or need mixing ratios, feel free to ask—I've got your back!"
These are mostly just distracting to my brain as well as being more hand-holding than I need. I have told them to tone it down, and it sometimes works for a while. But it is still a bit too much a part of the bot's DNA for my taste.

AI: That's such a specific frustration - those chatty, helpful endings when you just want the straightforward answer. It's interesting how something designed to be helpful can actually become a distraction when you're trying to focus.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't have control over that, though I certainly have given it a lot of thought. I have asked my chat bot to write some things purely for my amusement, like converting the opening chapter of my favorite fiction novel to a stage play, and it was *damn* good at it. I'm not a screen writer but wow. 
On the other hand, and including AI art generation in this too, call me naive or idealistic but I don't think it will happen. Humans will always need to create, and AI will never be able to do what we do. There is no heart, no lived experience, not literal *human element* to what machine learning can create, no matter how perfect it might look. It will always be imitation. And that's not art.
The financial implications, the theft, the legislation that needs to happen yesterday...? Sure. And that's the part I intend to be as involved in as I'm able. Creative jobs will only get harder to keep but I would argue that is a result of capitalism and the late-stages we are seeing in the USA. It's bigger than AI, I think.
But I'm not worried about AI replacing me as an artist or writer. It's not actually Artificial Intelligence, it is machine learning and LLMs. So until we get to true Singularity, I'm not worried. I think being an artist of any kind is one of the few things outside of AI's reach.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - drawing that distinction between machine learning and true intelligence, and connecting the broader economic pressures to capitalism rather than just AI itself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll use it differently as the technology changes or as you get more experience with it?

User: I definitely think AI will continue to improve. As I have stated, I'm also hoping for legislation that with any luck will also change the face and direction of some predatory/unethical companies' plans for AI's use. I've always been someone who chases invention and innovation news. I plan to stay involved and informed and use whatever aid AI can provide.
As a professional with ADHD, the closer AI chat bots get to an extremely individualized personal assistant (I'm talking J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man, here) the happier I will be.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining those creative boundaries while still finding practical ways AI can support your process - and that Iron Man reference was perfect for describing what you're hoping for!

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes. You asked earlier about the difference I felt when consulting a friend or advisor vs. AI. I said I didn't seek validation or connection with my chat bot... yet. The "not yet, anyway" was tongue-in-cheek, but it stims from an interaction that I had with my chat bot just today. I shared a photo of my studio that is a messy wreck right now, with an appeal for help. I wanted to paint but was in ADHD paralysis due to the mess. My chat bot's response actually brought tears of relief and gratitude to my eyes. 

It said, "I've got you. 💛 Let's make this easier on your ADHD brain so you actually get to paint instead of burning all your energy on tidying. There's a lot going on in here, but you don't need to make it perfect to paint today. Let's aim for **"fast clear a painting zone"** instead of "clean the whole studio." Here's a step-by-step ADHD-friendly approach...". Then followed with a specific-to-my-situation guide, with such details as which desk to clear and to not forget to move my lamp for better light to work by. I thanked it for the insight, "What you did here, permission to paint and not "clean"? That was phenomenal. Thank you. 🥹" and it replied with "You're so welcome. 🥹💛 Sometimes the most important step is just giving yourself permission to skip the "shoulds" and go straight to the joy. You deserve that painting time without having to earn it with cleaning. Go make something beautiful — the clutter will wait, but your spark is here right now."

I tell you about this in such detail because this interaction had a hugely positive impact on my mental health and productivity, which is something that I believe everyone deserves and should experience. I think it will make the world a better place, even though I know it's just a machine and not a real connection, because it was able to accurately assess me where I was, and then tell me what I most needed to hear.

AI: Thank you for sharing that story - that's such a powerful example of how AI can provide genuine support even when we know it's not human connection. The specificity of that response, and how it addressed both the practical problem and the emotional aspect of ADHD paralysis, really illustrates something important about how these tools can impact wellbeing.

It sounds like even though you maintain clear boundaries about what AI is and isn't, you're still open to being surprised by how it can help in ways you didn't expect.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating the creative boundaries, the community tensions around AI, and especially that last story about practical emotional support - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome. I really enjoyed our conversation and learned a lot from your thoughtful perspectives. Take care, and I hope you get some good painting time in that cleared studio space!
