Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great and happy to begin straight away.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me summarise articles online or textbook chapter, I find it really useful to have the main points given back to me instead of reading through all the texts. I then either send the summaries out to the my students or I may then ask the chatbot  to create a set of worksheets or tasks based on the source material. I also use AI to help me with grading, I will add the student work and ask for feedback.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you with several different aspects of teaching. When you mention using AI for grading and providing feedback on student work, can you tell me more about how that process works for you?

User: I upload the assignment brief and module guide and sometimes supporting materials plus the assignment submission. I then ask the chatbot to determine whether the student has met the assessment criteria and provide feedback on whey they did well and areas for improvement. I have usually marked the assignments or have an idea of the grade but it helps me focus my feedback or pick things I have missed.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - using AI as a kind of second opinion or to help refine your feedback. When you're going through this process with student assignments, do you find yourself collaborating back and forth with the AI, or do you typically give it all the materials at once and let it provide a complete assessment?

User: I have used both approaches, for simpler assignments with more discrete answers I add everything at once and get the complete assessment. However for longer assignments or multi-part assessments I will work more closely with the AI and focus on one area first, e.g. how well did the student meet the learning outcomes. I would then focus on the technical aspects of the assignment and ask the AI if they generally met these or where consistent throughout the work. I now have a set of tried and tested questions I use for AI feedback.

AI: It sounds like you've really developed a systematic approach over time. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I like to set up glossaries and key term activities myself as I want to make sure they students are using the terminology for a specific exam board or to other courses they are doing at the college. I could get the AI to create these sets for me but I find it helps me with my teaching as I have had to put this together and I find I am clearer in my own delivery.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like the process of creating those materials yourself has value beyond just the end product. You mentioned that working through the glossaries and key terms helps with your own clarity in delivery. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at your college using it similarly, or have you taken a different path?

User: I have found there is a lot of ambiguity around AI usage in education as there aren't any nationally set guidelines. Institutions have started to set their own standards but there is a general lack of clarity. In my own workplace some teacher use AI very little and use education packs they purchase or materials from previous years. Other colleagues use it on a daily basis from creating powerpoints, worksheets and assessments through to marking. I am somewhere in the middle where I use it alongside my own materials. I also think it depends on the subject being taught.

AI: That's a really telling observation about the lack of clear guidelines creating this varied landscape. You mentioned that you think it depends on the subject being taught - can you tell me more about what you mean by that?

User: Yes, I would say more traditional subjects such as English and social sciences tend to use the same texts over several years and there is little variation in the specifications that exam boards use. In other subjects such as engineering, computer science and STEM in general need change more quickly and with new advancements teachers have to adapt to this and bring in real world examples and case studies. AI is great for helping find case studies in this field. I also think that AI has difficulty marking handwritten mathematical problems and it is still very time consuming to mark those.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the dynamic nature of some fields versus the more stable curriculum in others. You've touched on both positive and challenging aspects of using AI. Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI made me feel really satisfied when I was able to work with it to turn quite a try textbook chapter on variables and control flow into a set of engaging lessons complete with worksheets tailored for that the specification. I have also had time where the AI has marked an assessment really high however the student did not follow the initial instructions, I did several prompts to get it to recognises this but the AI was just echoing my thoughts and it did not look as if it was actually reading the submission again. I gave up with it and just did my own feedback. It was like it was stuck.

AI: That frustrating experience really stands out - it sounds like the AI got locked into a particular assessment and wouldn't reconsider even when you tried to redirect it. That must have been quite time-consuming.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel that AI will take over things like assessments and feedback and will be developed in the future to create whole courses, e.g. materials and assessments and even video content. However I think that people will still want to talk to a real person and have that contact. I try to do as much training as I can, particularly on new developments and features in AI so that I can utilise them and also teach students how to use it to help them with their studies.

AI: It sounds like you're taking a really proactive approach - staying current with AI developments while focusing on that irreplaceable human element. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I think I will increase my usage of AI as I become more confident in what it can do. I see it as a really useful tool in the workplace, particularly for my role. I would like to develop a set of more bespoke chats for things like programming labs, computer science theory, etc and also for feedback.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in education. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how different subjects have varying needs when it comes to AI integration, and your balanced approach of using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining those uniquely human elements of teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we have covered everything in detail from my perspective of the benefits to the challenges of using AI in an educational setting.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating the ambiguous landscape of AI in education, your systematic approach to grading and feedback, and your thoughts on maintaining that essential human connection with students will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both the successes and the frustrations - that balanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the real-world experience of working with AI tools.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
