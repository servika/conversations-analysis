Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI applications in my workplace to search for local resources according to a specified set of parameters. In my industry (Social Services), I worked with unhoused populations, and I have to find immediate resources and multidisciplinary teams quickly, in sometimes emergent situations. Although my workplace has an immediate list of local emergency resources available at hand, sometimes I need to access highly specific resources that might otherwise be missing. AI has assisted me in the past to locate resources quickly for clients that I work with, without needing to scan and search for google search results, which can be time consuming. AI also assists me with keeping track of logs, interactions, and daily task lists at my work. For example, shift logs are updated every day, and on busy days, I can have up to 10 logs that describe occurrences at my housing location. I can quickly use AI to summarize events that occurred, and to prioritize events based on their order of importance, which is especially useful at shift change, where the most important events should be discussed early on with my night shift team. I also enjoy using AI to be a visual check for cleaning and maintenance tasks.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI is helping you in some really critical, time-sensitive situations. 

Tell me more about that visual check for cleaning and maintenance tasks. How does that work in practice?

User: We have a running lists of tasks that must be completed daily, and we typically have 4 staff at our location at all times. There are about 35 tasks throughout the shift that must be completed, and we decide ahead of time what each staff member would like to do. Once we decide what everyone will be doing, I create a task list for myself using AI. I usually update each task with "done" or something akin to that. Having a running list on the desktop is easier for me to work with than a pencil and paper, as all of my other logs and work are on the same desktop as well.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having everything centralized on your desktop rather than switching between digital and paper systems.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do enjoy writing the basis for all of my logs independently of AI. I want my original interaction to hold true when I log notes. During a busy day, I do appreciate that AI can embellish and emphasize my writing in a way that might be lacking as the day goes on. It definitely helps with the mental load of multitasking, and switching up between desktop based work, and hand on work.

AI: That's really insightful - you want to maintain the authenticity of your original observations but appreciate AI's help with the presentation when you're mentally stretched.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will usually collaborate with it throughout the task. I will read over its output briefly, and make adjustments as I go. Typically, the adjustments have to do with verbosity and emphasizing particular interactions. I am a bit anxious to just let AI do all of the thinking for me, because I still want to have some autonomy and control over my workflow.

AI: That need for autonomy and control makes complete sense, especially in your field where the details really matter.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: In social services, a lot of technology that is used in the workplace is out of date. I think embracing newer initiatives in AI technology is a good step forward in this industry, since a large majority of the work is still person-centric and hands on. I haven't been updated on any policies regarding the use of AI, and my workers enjoy using it to complete their work in a similar manner to me.  I do find many people letting AI do everything for them, which I try my best to avoid.

AI: It's interesting that you've noticed colleagues letting AI handle everything while you're more intentional about maintaining that balance.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: In one particular situation, I wanted to use AI to allow me to explain directions to a resident who urgently needed to get to a location across town, probably a 25 minute walk by foot. They didn't have access to any services (as this was late in the evening), and our office was out of taxi chits for them to use. I was new to the work location at the time, so I didn't have a good idea of where everything was, and I was the only individual in the office, so I couldn't rely on my coworkers to explain to the individual how to get to their location. I used AI to describe the directions to the location (which involved about 7 specific steps) from the office location, and copied the output to a word document to print for the individual. I checked back in with the resident about a week later when I saw them again, and they were very pleased with the assistance.

AI: That's a wonderful example of how AI helped you provide critical support when you really needed it. It sounds like having that reliable backup was invaluable in a situation where someone was depending on you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something that I think of frequently! Using AI to assist in using critical thought and analysis is something that everyone should be aware of. I think AI should be used in conjunction with with these skills, and not just relied on exclusively. If I have AI do all of the shining for me, I would lose out on honing these skills, and transferable abilities that I have built in my career. Of course, in my industry, hands on skills and working with people is still the basis of the work itself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - using AI in conjunction with your skills rather than as a replacement for them. The fact that your work is fundamentally people-centered probably gives you a good foundation for that balance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I want to maintain my relationship with AI in the same way I do now- using it as a tool to assist me, helping me balance the mental load of tasks that could be done in a more efficient manner, while also maintaining a critical awareness of its overuse. I think balance is the key to everything, and using AI should be no different. I will definitely keep using it as I have been!

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's efficiency while preserving your own critical thinking skills and the authenticity of your client interactions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that covers everything! Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. The way you've found that balance between efficiency and authenticity in such critical work really highlights some important considerations for how AI can best support people in their roles.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
