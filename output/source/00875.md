Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Perfect. Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I generally use AI to help me compose emails, mostly external emails, but sometimes to people on my team (especially when wanting to be careful about how I am approaching a sensitive topic). I also use AI to help generate themes from data sets and to find connections. I use AI to help me reword complex documents into more "lay" language or to summarize lengthy documents into more readable segments. I will also use AI to help me find information and help with research.

AI: That's a really diverse range of uses. I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about using AI for sensitive topics with your team. 

Can you tell me more about what makes you turn to AI specifically for those careful conversations?

User: I have a tendency to avoid being direct with people when I'm afraid of hurting their feelings or sounding too harsh. AI is really good at helping me strike a balance between being upfront and clear, without being avoidant or harsh.

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you navigate some really nuanced communication challenges. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle easy emails, especially ones that I want to be very much in my own tone of voice. I prefer to handle organizational tasks myself, like scheduling and planning, and generally meeting minutes (if I'm developing a summary of the meeting and then actionable items).

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you draw some clear lines about what feels right to delegate versus keep for yourself.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate. I might ask the AI to help me write an email and then give broad strokes of the content and a specific tone I'm looking for. Then I will usually iterate on the response, asking for changes or edits until we get to exactly what I'm looking for. I might give the AI a dataset and ask it to find common themes, then provide more nuance to refine the themes and get more specific. There's usually a fair amount of back and forth

AI: That back-and-forth collaborative approach sounds really intentional. It seems like you're treating AI more as a thinking partner than just a tool to complete tasks.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: AI is still pretty underused in my workplace, but not frowned upon. I didn't really start using it myself until recently. I work remotely quite a bit (post-COVID), connecting with my team throughout the day, but have really missed the in-office opportunities for collaboration. AI has provided another way for me to collaborate when missing the in-person brainstorming.

AI: That's a fascinating connection - using AI to fill some of that collaborative gap from remote work. It sounds like AI has become a substitute for those spontaneous brainstorming moments you used to have in the office.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt super satisfied recently when I was doing some thematic analysis with a group of interviews. There was so much content and I was getting really overwhelmed. This is usually when I would sit down with a teammate and start mind mapping together. I fed some of the quotes I had collected from the interviews and asked the AI to help me develop some themes and subthemes and start grouping the quotes. Once we had the skeleton, I used the AI as a sounding board to refine and work through the material until I had a pretty substantial framework. It really cut my worktime in half and made me feel super confident and efficient.

AI: That sounds like such a productive collaboration - and it's clear how much that efficiency and confidence boost meant to you. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, absolutely. I have worried that I would become a bit lazy or reliant - but what I actually find is that I'm getting better at things like those challenging emails and in mapping out my thoughts. I think AI has been supportive in that way, giving me more confidence and providing me with ideas to prime the pump.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like rather than making you dependent, AI is actually helping you develop those skills more confidently. The idea of it "priming the pump" is a great way to put it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will continue to use it as I have, maybe a bit less in those areas that I just needed a boost (email writing), but will probably start using it more for tasks that I haven't been, now that I've developed more trust that it is reliable. I think it would be very useful for taking a meeting transcript and then making a summary and action items. I think I will start using it more organizational tasks, like to-do lists scheduling. Given how helpful it has been with my qualitative data analysis and structuring, I'm likely to start using it for support in similar areas, idea development and refinement.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has become a substitute for in-person collaboration and how it's actually building your confidence rather than creating dependency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative thinking partner, especially in remote work settings, and how it's helping you build confidence in areas like sensitive communications will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
