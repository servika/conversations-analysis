Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm with Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a philosophy-focused social media influencer, I utilize LLMs to relate philosophical ideas together from overlapping traditions, increase the precision of language for novel concepts, and engage in a socratic dialogue. I utilize latent diffusion models to generate visual media such as thumbnails, and I'm hoping to integrate agentic LLMs to design a workflow to generate content ideas, titles and thumbnail composition descriptions, script outlines, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across multiple aspects of content creation. Let me dig deeper into one part of what you mentioned.

When you say you engage in Socratic dialogue with AI, what does that actually look like in practice? Walk me through how that unfolds during your work.

User: Based on the prior step of the conversation, I think of potential solutions I have to the problem at hand. Rather than state it, I propose it as a question to constrain myself with intellectual humility. For instance, regarding the ontological categories of Form and Function in the context of Process Philosophy, I may state "Form is the totality of internal relations of an actual occasion? Function is the totality of external relations of an actual occasion?"

AI: That's a really specific approach - using questions to test your own thinking rather than making direct assertions. 

Tell me more about what happens next in that dialogue. How does the AI respond to those questioning formulations, and how do you work with its responses?

User: The AI will typically start by responding Yes or No, and then briefly explaining a summary as to why. Thereafter, it will go into more detail and often relate the question to ideas of schools of thought already mentioned in the conversation history. For instance, it may relate my idea of Form and Function to the ideas expressed in a published work of a thinker, such as Alfred North Whitehead who proposes a form of process philosophy in his book Process and Reality.

AI: So the AI becomes almost like a philosophical sparring partner, connecting your formulations to established thinkers and works. 

When the AI makes these connections - like linking your ideas to Whitehead - do you find yourself accepting those connections, or do you push back and continue the dialogue? What determines how you respond to its analysis?

User: I consider the response, though I consider the value of the relation to be low most of the time, but when it is valuable, it is substantially valuable since it would have been hard for me to find it without doing rigorous research over a breadth of material. I typically continue on my own line of questioning, editing the question I proposed to get more precise based off the push back rather than engaging with the relation, unless it brings up something valuable such as a new reference to a relevant quotation.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're primarily using the AI to refine your own thinking through that questioning process, rather than following its suggested connections.

When you say you edit your question to get more precise based on the pushback, can you give me an example of how one of your questions evolved through that back-and-forth process?

User: A relevant example would be an investigation into Aesthetics, particularly the question "What is Beauty?". I started with "Beauty is the phenomenal quality of the True?" I got push back with the Whitehead idea that Beauty is Harmony of Contrasts with Intensity. From that I relate to an idea of Jordan Peterson that meaning exists in a balance of Order and Chaos and the Daoist Taiji, which gives rise to yin and yang, which represent at least something similar. I ask it to expand upon those relations and come to the next question that Beauty is the alignment of patterned and novel occasions with the Taiji/Dao/Creativity. After pursuing that line of thought I intuited another angle to come at it from and continued my investigation. I hope that is sufficient.

AI: That's a perfect example - I can see how you're using the AI's pushback as a springboard for deeper inquiry rather than an endpoint. You took Whitehead's "Harmony of Contrasts with Intensity" and wove it into your own synthesis with Peterson and Daoist concepts.

I'm curious about something you mentioned earlier - you said you're hoping to integrate agentic AI to generate content ideas, titles, and script outlines. How does that kind of task delegation compare to this Socratic dialogue approach? Are you thinking about those as fundamentally different ways of working with AI?

User: I consider those to be similar, but distinct processes. My Socratic dialogue is extremely dynamic, existing at the edge of my understanding, while the content ideas, titles, and script outlines will have respective statically engineered system prompts with dynamic user prompt input. The similarity comes into play with my editorial selection of the best from the rest and setting up the AI to iterate upon the ideas.

AI: That distinction is really clear - the edge-of-understanding dialogue versus the more structured content generation. 

When you talk about "editorial selection of the best from the rest," what criteria do you find yourself using to make those judgments? What makes one AI-generated content idea or title stand out to you over others?

User: My criteria will be/tends to be aesthetic, trying to maximize beauty of text with media to create a beautiful narrative/experience that will be worthwhile from those to allow their attention to be drawn, without using grotesque techniques of capturing attention. Such grotesque techniques would be like using near-inappropriate imagery, inflammatory language, over-saturated quick moving media, <2 second shot duration (quick jump cuts), etc.

AI: I appreciate that ethical dimension - actively avoiding those attention-grabbing tactics that feel manipulative. 

Since you're applying these aesthetic criteria to AI-generated content, are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I will never let an Artificial Intelligence make an ethical determination, as it cannot be held responsible. The final decision to edit and publish will always be mine and mine alone as I can be held responsible. Not just for the liability of publishing something that goes against the Terms of Service of a social media platform, but as an expression of the virtue of craftsmanship over the vice of sloth.

AI: That's a powerful principle - maintaining responsibility and embodying craftsmanship rather than sloth. The ethical dimension and personal accountability seem central to how you draw those boundaries.

How have your colleagues or the broader community in your space - other philosophy influencers or content creators - influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you encountered different approaches or perspectives that have shaped your thinking?

User: Other content creators have utilized freelance workers and have designed full AI pipelines and agentic organizations to produce videos from start to finish, but I'm not typically a fan of the final aesthetic value of the videos. They tend to produce videos with sufficient information in them to have viewers rationalize it as informative while primarily containing artificial entertainment value. The result is a video that will get attention by a pathological choice on the part of the viewer, such that the viewer did watch the video, but they should not have if they wanted to have a beautiful day.

AI: That's a striking way to put it - the difference between content that genuinely enriches someone's day versus content that exploits pathological viewing habits. It sounds like you see your approach with AI as fundamentally different from these full automation pipelines.

Can you share a specific time when using AI in your work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I feel satisfied when working with AI when it is able to generate meaningful responses that contain references to relevant thinkers or ideas that I haven't heard of, such as the relation of the Order and Chaos relation of Beauty to Entropy and Information Theory. I feel mildly frustrated when the AI is overly-agreeable, as it just gets patronizing after a while. I feel frustrated when it doesn't pick up on implicit context that I think is obvious. For instance, for shorthand I used ^ as a logical AND, but it took the next character as an exponential. Thereafter I said that it meant AND, so it just restated that it meant AND without changing the symbol. I asked it to use the AND symbol, but the model just replaced "^" with "AND", thereafter I  got it to work, but that was a lot of back and forth that got rather frustrating.

AI: That frustration with the symbol confusion sounds maddening - especially when you're in a flow state with philosophical inquiry and get derailed by something that basic. The over-agreeableness issue is interesting too.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you integrate more AI into your workflow?

User: Every skill regards an action and those skills where AI will take over will still need a value orientation which will be best provided by a human. The technical finesse of the skill will be less important to learn to use in practice, but I think understanding it by doing it oneself will still be key to understanding the skill at an abstract level. That is why I think AI augmentation to integration into a routine has to occur rather than having an AI do all the work so that one can grow in skill with the AI rather than having the AI do all of the work.

AI: That's a thoughtful framework - maintaining that understanding through practice even as the technical execution shifts to AI. The idea of growing in skill *with* AI rather than being replaced by it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading as the technology continues to develop?

User: I hope to offload the majority of idea generation through association to AI and just engage in editorial evaluation of the association, which will help me stay in a flow state rather than switching between two mental modes, hastening production. This won't just be related to my Socratic dialogue, but with the script writing, sound design, and visual media generation.

AI: That vision of staying in flow state through editorial evaluation rather than constantly switching mental modes is compelling - almost like the AI handles the generative heavy lifting while you maintain creative direction.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your approach to AI integration. I was particularly struck by your principle of never letting AI make ethical determinations, and your distinction between augmentation that maintains craftsmanship versus full automation that might lead to what you called "pathological" content consumption.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective on maintaining ethical responsibility while leveraging AI for philosophical inquiry and content creation has been incredibly insightful. The way you've thought through the boundaries between human judgment and AI assistance - especially around aesthetics, ethics, and craftsmanship - will be really valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your approach today.
