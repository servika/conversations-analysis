Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm creating an animated series that is beyond just the show. The show itself is created in a painterly style with an immersive world of different characters and backgrounds. The basic idea of the show is after an apocalyptic event a wife tries to find her husband but starts to realize that maybe the event was caused by someone and not something. My typical project is creating a story line, characters and the finally animating it all into a scene.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating and complex project - I love the mystery element of the wife discovering the truth behind the apocalyptic event. The painterly animation style sounds really distinctive too.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use the AI to deepen the lore of the world and the characters inside. For example, there is a government faction that believes they know what's best for the world so I used the AI to create names, background stories and beliefs so that I don't have to spend too much time on those details. It also helps that I can just ask the AI about a character rather than have to find what I'm looking for through pages and pages of notes. I also use the AI to link in-series events with real world events so that the show borders on reality but is still a little sci-fi. I also use the AI to create reference images that I base the characters on so that I can get a front and side view from the AI and model it out from there. I also use the AI to plan out the plot line for each season and each episode. I know the rough direction that I want the show to go but the AI gives me some out of the box options that I wouldn't have thought of otherwise. And lastly, I also use the AI to create textures for UV maps.

AI: That's a really comprehensive integration of AI across so many different aspects of your creative process - from world-building and character development all the way through to the technical production elements like UV mapping textures.

Can you describe a specific recent project or scene where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the creator?

User: I am creating a teaser trailer for social media and I used the AI for a lot of it. One of the first things was making sure I wasn't giving away too much of the story. So I told the AI what my vision was and it suggested ways to make it more mysterious. I also used the AI to explain how to do different techniques within Blender (3d modeling software) such as parallax images. The AI to me is like an assistant that has great ideas and I never feel like it's taking anything away from the creative process. The scenes and characters are all based on my descriptions and the AI helps me take it from good to great.

AI: That's really interesting how you describe the AI as an assistant that helps take your work "from good to great." I'm curious about that dynamic.

When you're working with AI in these different ways - whether it's suggesting plot points or helping with Blender techniques - how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions? How does that collaboration feel to you?

User: I'd say it's mostly me but sometimes the AI makes a great suggestion and we go with that. Sometimes I do tell the AI it has "creative freedom" for things that aren't as important, such as background characters or objects. Sometimes the AI tells me it has the capabilities to do things that I wouldn't have even thought to ask (such as textures for Blender). Overall, I'd say I steer the creativeness when it's something important (such as a main character) and the AI drives the less important things, such as background objects (e.g., I needed a table of family photos for the bedroom of the show but it didn't matter what any of it looked like and the AI created a wedding photo, a photo at the park and some other random scenic photos).

AI: That's a really thoughtful way of thinking about creative control - having you steer the important elements while letting AI handle the supporting details. It sounds like you've developed a clear sense of what you want to maintain ownership over versus what you're comfortable delegating.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The biggest change I think is the idea process. Before I would have to come up with all of the ideas and since I do the production myself, I'd have to keep in mind that whatever I brainstorm I also have to create. So my early projects felt very basic. Now that I can bounce Ideas off of the AI and even have it create background elements it frees up more time for creating assets as well as beefs up the quality of the work. Using the photos on the desk example from the last question; before I used AI I'd have to image the photos I want to use, create them in Photoshop, then create the frames and table in Blender. Now I can just take the image the AI gives me and essentially paste it onto a shape in blender and it's done.

AI: That's a powerful shift - it sounds like AI has really expanded what's possible for you as a solo creator by handling those time-intensive background elements. You mentioned that your early projects felt "very basic" because you had to limit your ideas to what you could realistically produce yourself.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Personally my only concern is what will happen if I can't use images that AI provides due to copyright or something like that. Overall I'm worried that some people may use AI to oversaturate certain markets and media making user created work less intriguing. I've already seen it happen with 3D asset marketplaces. They are filled with AI generated models that have terrible topography or are super cheap compared to user created assets.

AI: Those are really practical and valid concerns. The copyright uncertainty around AI-generated images is definitely something many creators are grappling with, and it sounds like you've already seen the market impact firsthand with those 3D asset marketplaces.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think the way you collaborate with AI will change?

User: I don't see it changing too much. I also want to create a website that will go along side the web series. It's going to be as if the website is an in-world company's website and I'm going to integrate it with an AI so that it will act as a Wiki page for the series but people can ask the AI things and it will answer in character as if it's for the world of my show. I also have a video game planned that I've mentioned to the AI so it sometimes suggests ways to have crossovers. As AI evolves I think certain elements will get easier for me, especially if I can start automating some aspects of the creation process, freeing up more time.

AI: That's such a creative approach - having an AI that can respond in-character as part of the world you've built! It sounds like you're thinking about AI not just as a production tool, but as a way to extend the storytelling experience itself.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how you've developed such a clear sense of where you want to maintain creative control versus where you're comfortable delegating to AI, and your vision for using AI to actually become part of the storytelling experience through that in-world website.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that's it.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI across so many different aspects of your animated series - from world-building and character development to technical production and even future interactive storytelling - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really fascinating to hear how you've found ways to use AI that enhance rather than replace your creative vision, and I'm excited about your plans for that in-world website experience. Best of luck with your animated series!
