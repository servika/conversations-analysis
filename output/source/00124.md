Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do a variety of tasks for the day to day management of a swim school with multiple locations. Most of my work is administrative or customer service based. The bulk of what I use AI for is creating diverse lesson plans for the instructors. I also use it to get creative ideas for our events, decorations, and happenings around the buildings.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI in some really creative ways for your swim school. 

Can you walk me through what creating those lesson plans looks like? How do you typically work with AI to develop them?

User: Usually I will do one level at a time. I inform the AI of what the level is and attach our skills that go with that level. For each month, I ask the AI to come up with lesson plans for our thirty minute lessons to alternate and rotate the skills worked on. We don't have enough time per class to work on every skill that has to be mastered in that level.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - needing to strategically rotate skills within those 30-minute windows. 

Tell me more about how you decide what information to give the AI versus what you keep control of in that process. Do you find yourself editing or adjusting what it comes up with?

User: Yes I usually will have to edit because the AI isn't always aware of time constraints and number of kids in each lesson per instructor.

AI: Ah, so those practical classroom realities - the time limits and class sizes - are things you need to adjust for after the AI generates the initial plans.

When you're making those edits, are you typically tweaking the AI's suggestions, or do you sometimes find yourself completely reworking parts of what it gives you?

User: No usually I am just tweaking or reformatting.

AI: That sounds like a pretty efficient workflow then. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in managing the swim school that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Right now, I handle sending out follow-up emails to all of our new students after their first lesson. I think that AI could handle helping create the list  but I'm not sure how that would be done without errors.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - you see the potential for AI to help but you're concerned about accuracy when it comes to something as important as reaching out to new families.

What is it about that follow-up process that makes you feel like you need to maintain that personal control? Is it the stakes involved, or something else?

User: We wouldn't want any emails to be sent that include mistakes or could give a bad impression to our  clients and future clients

AI: That makes complete sense - those first impressions with new families are so critical for your business.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Collaborate with it

AI: Tell me more about what that collaboration looks like in practice. When you're working through something with AI, how does that back-and-forth typically unfold?

User: Usually I will try to complete a task but if I'm stuck I will turn to AI

AI: So AI becomes your problem-solving partner when you hit a roadblock. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at the swim school using it too, or are you more of a pioneer in this area?

User: I don't think others use it too much because I handle most of the behind the scenes work. A majority of our staff are just swim instructors or lifeguards

AI: That's interesting - so you're really the one exploring AI's potential for the operational side of things while the instructors focus on the hands-on teaching.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would say I felt satisfied when I decided to use it to come up with some games our swim team could play during practice because I was running out of ideas and wanted something new and creative.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI helping you break through a creative block. 

What made that experience particularly satisfying for you? Was it the fresh ideas it generated, or something about how the process worked?

User: It was so easy. And I didn't have to think to hard and I could focus on other things

AI: That ease and mental bandwidth it freed up for you sounds really valuable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think that it could decrease creativity from us because people will turn to AI

AI: That's a thoughtful concern. Do you find yourself trying to balance using AI's help with maintaining your own creative muscles, or is that something you haven't had to navigate yet?

User: I tend to lean more on it but I want to maintain my creative muscles as well

AI: That tension between convenience and keeping your own skills sharp is really relatable.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it for different types of tasks, or changing how you work with it?

User: I think it would be beneficial for behind the scene things. We recently had an issue where our clients weren't informed that we would be closed over Labor Day weekend and it could be used to generate those reminders.

AI: That's a great example - using AI to help prevent those communication gaps that can really impact your families' experience.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that balance between leveraging AI's efficiency while being mindful of maintaining your own creative abilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I don't think so

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're using AI to handle the administrative and creative challenges of running a swim school - from lesson planning to event ideas - have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you're seeing and the areas where you're still cautious. That kind of honest perspective is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are actually being used in the real world.

Thanks again for participating in this interview!
