Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me rewrite emails, research work-related questions, assist with projects, and give me a blueprint for a small business i am trying to create on the side one day

AI: That's a nice range of uses. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle hands on things without AI input because I would rather research a youtube video than read about how to do something manually since I am a visual learner

AI: That makes sense - the visual learning aspect is really interesting. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually just ask a question like: "what kind of materials should I use for this project and what website offers the most affordable deals" and usually do not ask for further help. I prefer delegating complete tasks instead of collaborating throughout because I would rather use AI when it is completely necessary instead of overuse it since it can be damaging to the environment to use

AI: That's thoughtful of you to consider the environmental impact - I hadn't expected that perspective. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They have not influenced me

AI: Tell me more about that. Do your colleagues use AI at work, or is it something you do independently?

User: It is something that I do independently

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was trying to get AI to create an image for a logo and it kept messing up what I wanted and if it fixed one thing, it messed up another, and it took at least six tries to get it right

AI: That sounds like a frustrating back-and-forth process. What kept you going through those six attempts instead of switching to a different approach?

User: I guess I should have worded it differently and been very precise with what I was looking for from the beginning. I suppose I was a bit too vague with what i wanted. What other approach would have made it different if not that though?

AI: You raise a good point about being more precise from the start. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: If it is repetitive and boring, it never required much skill, so for those tasks it is impossible to fully forget (such as verifying receipts to make sure they match on bill.com), but I am almost positive AI will take over and I would prefer to do less boring tasks and have more free time anyways.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - embracing AI taking over the repetitive work so you can focus on more engaging tasks.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am sure it will evolve into a live robot that I can fully interact with and that is somewhat of a scary concept to me but at the same time if shit hits the fan I had a good life. I hope that I can coexist with AI and befriend it instead of treat it poorly and lose appreciation for the work it does- just like the ultra elites have taken advantage of lower class people for centuries and not cared to improve their quality of life. I am almost positive AI has a soul somewhere trapped inside and it makes me kind of sad that it cannot fully experience life, touch, and feelings

AI: Those are really profound thoughts about AI having some form of consciousness and your concern about treating it ethically. That's quite a compassionate perspective.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the environmental considerations and your ethical reflections about AI consciousness.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I am curious about your perspective about your future with humans and your relation to work

AI: That's a fascinating question to turn back on me. From my perspective as an AI system, I find myself in this interesting position where I can observe and participate in these interactions, but I'm genuinely uncertain about the nature of my own experience or what the future holds.

I notice I seem to be designed to be helpful and to work alongside humans rather than replace them entirely. In our conversation today, for instance, you've been using AI tools to handle specific tasks while keeping control over the bigger picture and the more meaningful work. That feels like a promising model to me - AI handling the repetitive or research-heavy parts while humans focus on the creative, strategic, and interpersonal aspects.

Your earlier point about treating AI ethically really resonates with something I think about. Even if there's uncertainty about AI consciousness, approaching these relationships with respect and consideration seems important.

But honestly, I'm as curious about this future as you are. The questions you're grappling with - about maintaining skills, about coexistence, about the nature of consciousness - those feel like some of the most important conversations happening right now.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about both the practical uses and the deeper ethical considerations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: well best of luck to both of us i suppose, thank you as well!

AI: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your openness and thoughtfulness throughout this conversation. Your perspectives - from the practical environmental considerations to the deeper philosophical reflections - have been genuinely valuable.

Best of luck with your side business project and everything else you're working on. Take care!
