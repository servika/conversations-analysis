Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: i'm a senior level software engineer. So I write code, research and design architecture. I use Claude Code and Cursor a lot for all these works.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned using Claude Code and Cursor for writing code, research, and architecture design - that covers quite a range of activities.

Could you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using these tools? For instance, when you're working on architecture design, how do you actually engage with the AI?

User: Architecture design - I will start off by getting all the requirements (functional, non functional, compliance, etc) fleshed out and written down. That's the hardest part. Once I have that, I compose a PRD document and ask Cursor/Claude Code to do research and help me with the tech spec.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow. You mentioned that getting the requirements fleshed out is the hardest part, and you handle that yourself before bringing in the AI tools.

Tell me more about why you choose to do that requirements gathering piece yourself rather than involving AI from the very beginning.

User: Because 1) it involves communicating with stakeholders, and 2) it requires understanding business context, for both AI haven't come close to become an effective assistant yet.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those interpersonal and contextual understanding aspects seem like they require human judgment.

Once you do bring AI into the process for research and tech spec work, how would you describe your interaction style? Are you working back and forth with it throughout that phase, or do you tend to give it the PRD and let it handle chunks of the work independently?

User: Yes. In reality it's always a back and forth conversation, although I don't want that to be lengthy. I try to make the PRD as detailed and with as much background context as possible so the AI might have easier time understanding the problem. Usually, I told them to do research first, then come back to me with some promising tools/architectures/frameworks, then I provide feedback, then I ask it to provide pros and cons of each choice it makes.

AI: That iterative approach sounds quite deliberate - giving context upfront, then having these structured rounds of research, feedback, and analysis.

You mentioned you don't want the back-and-forth to be lengthy. What drives that preference? Is it about efficiency, or are there other factors that make you want to keep those conversations more focused?

User: Because 1) it takes time, time is invaluable for me and for the business, 2) if the conversation is too lengthly, there's a high chance that it will go above the context limit. At that point it will compact the previous conversation - which I found detrimental to the response's quality.

AI: Those are really practical considerations - the time investment and the context window limitations affecting quality.

I'm curious about your colleagues or workplace culture. How has that influenced the way you approach using AI in your work? Are others on your team using these tools similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: as far as i know, my colleagues use more or less similar orkflows.

AI: Got it - so there seems to be some consistency in how your team approaches AI integration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't quite remember. But there's one pattern that repeatedly frustrates me: it is that the AI keeps "forgetting" one of the detail in my document or my previous message. When i corrected them, it attempted to correct it but not long before it went into circle and made the same mistake again and again several turns later.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you've been careful to provide detailed context upfront, and then the AI loses track of key details you've already established.

When this happens, how do you typically handle it? Do you have strategies for getting the conversation back on track, or does it sometimes mean starting over?

User: If it's too bad I'd start a new conversation and summarize what we have achieved

AI: That's a practical workaround, though it sounds like it adds to that time pressure you mentioned earlier.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you integrate these tools into your workflow?

User: To be honest I don't think much about it. If there's some aspects AI do well, then I will switch my focus to other areas.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - being flexible and shifting focus rather than worrying about skill preservation.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see changes coming in how you'll use these tools?

User: It will be a helpful assistant. Depends on how it will improve, I may consider using it more extensively.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your workflow as a senior software engineer and how you've integrated AI into different phases of your work. I particularly found it interesting how deliberately you approach the requirements phase yourself while leveraging AI for the research and analysis phases.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all. Thanks for the conversation.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical challenges - like context window limitations and the importance of upfront requirements gathering - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
