Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

If you're ready, I'd love to start by hearing about how AI fits into your typical workday. What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI tools for drafting documents, first-pass research, and very rarely analysis. I also use it to explain concepts with which I am unfamiliar, as a first step for pointing me in the right direction

AI: That's a great overview - it sounds like you're using AI across several different areas of your work. I'd love to dig deeper into how you actually work with AI on these tasks.

When you say you use it for drafting documents, could you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: Sometimes I will ask it to generate a new template document for me, such as an outline for a simple will. Sometimes I will feed it critical information or interview notes and ask it to output a memo/brief based on that information.

Once I have the basic generated document, I review and edit it as necessary. I also sometimes ask it to modify or add in extra sections if it missed something in the first pass

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you have a back-and-forth process where you're actively collaborating with the AI rather than just getting one output and being done.

Tell me more about that review and editing phase. When you're going through what the AI has generated, what kinds of changes do you typically find yourself making?

User: Editing certain types of language (sometimes the phrasing used is not appropriate for Canadian law) or removing unnecessary paragraphs. For briefs/memos, I will usually write the analysis for caselaw precedents myself  or rewrite if the generated content is decent. Caselaw is still a bit of a weakness of most models though

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where AI performs well versus where you need to step in with your expertise, especially around legal precedents and jurisdictional language.

You mentioned that caselaw analysis is something you typically handle yourself, even when the AI gives you decent content. What drives that decision for you - is it about accuracy, or are there other factors that make you prefer to do that work yourself?

User: Mostly accuracy. I do enjoy the writing process as I find it is very useful for focussing my thoughts - in order to be able to explain to another person, writing it out myself is very good practice

AI: That's a fascinating point about the writing process helping you focus your thoughts. It sounds like there's real value in that cognitive work of translating your thinking into clear explanations.

I'm curious - are there other types of tasks where you've noticed this same pattern, where you could use AI but you choose to do the work yourself because the process itself is valuable to you?

User: Creative writing is something for which I never use AI, I prefer to have my own voice and stlye

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining your own voice in creative work seems really important to you.

I'm interested in how you think about this boundary between tasks you delegate to AI versus those you keep for yourself. When you're faced with a new type of work task, how do you decide whether to involve AI or handle it entirely on your own?

User: I try to do things myself with just a little help from AI for the first few attempts, so that I have a decent grasp on the task. Once I feel like I know how to perform that particular task, I can involve AI a bit more. Emails to clients or other lawyers I will always write myself, because I prefer having my own voice/style and I think particularly for clients it adds a personal touch. I do believe that in the near future personal interactions will be of premium value.

AI: That approach of learning the task yourself first before involving AI more heavily is really thoughtful - it sounds like you're building your own competency foundation before leveraging AI's capabilities.

You mentioned that you think personal interactions will be of premium value in the near future. Tell me more about that - what's driving that belief for you?

User: The better that generative algorithms become, the more people will use and rely on them for everything - from work to advice, to friendships, to content creation. Knowing that there is a real person on the other end of a conversation will probably be something people are willing to pay for. I am thinking about the attitudes people have about the difference between mass-produced widgets and artisanal crafts, or between a conversation with a voicemail machine versus a real person. These attitudes will doubtless play a part in the near-future AI-scape

AI: That's a really compelling analogy - the parallel between artisanal crafts and personal interaction in an AI-saturated world. It suggests you're thinking strategically about how to position your professional value.

How has this perspective influenced the way your colleagues or your workplace culture approaches AI? Are others in your field thinking about this the same way, or do you see different attitudes emerging?

User: I believe most people are seeing the benefits of AI in terms of workload reduction, and worried about the prospect of being out of work. If a basic subscription to an AI model can handle most simple legal work, for example, why would people pay many hundreds of dollars per hour for a lawyer? I do not think that given the current climate of remote-work, zoom calls, and mostly email-based communications, that most people are considering the inevitable reaction to this new paradigm of placing a premium on real human interactions. 

My perspective is usually historical and science-fiction influenced, since those are the things I tend to read, so instead of thinking about how this will impact myself I try to imagine how societies will develop with this new twist.

I try to have actual phone conversations for all important discussions, rather than just communicating by email; and in my personal life I do my best to stay off social media and see my friends and loved ones in person as often as possible. I understand that this habit is probably beneficial to my mental health, and that trend will probably only be stronger the more powerful AI becomes.

AI: That's a really thoughtful long-term perspective - you're not just adapting to AI, but anticipating how society might react to it. Your historical and science-fiction lens seems to give you a unique vantage point.

Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I tried to use it to bring up precedents for a file I had, regarding an employment contract termination and the appropriate severance. Every single case it brough up was a hallucination to some extent, either totally, or was misnamed, or miscited, or included but utterly irrelevant. Since that time (maybe 8 months ago), the models seem to be better at not generating so many failures

AI: That's a perfect example of why you handle caselaw analysis yourself now. It sounds like that experience really crystallized the reliability issues for you.

You mentioned that models seem better at avoiding those kinds of failures now. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI is improving rapidly - like legal research - versus areas where you feel confident it won't replace human judgment anytime soon?

User: For the simpler files, I believe AI will relatively quickly replace human analysis. I think that in a few years most basic stuff will be handled by AI, and only the grand-strategic, high level analysis, or really creative arguments will be more optimally done by humans. It is entirely possible that local bar associations and law societies will attempt to ban the use of AI for these things in order to maintain their professions (for example, paralegals seem to be entirely on the chopping block in the near future; they might resist). 

Arguing in court or mediation, obviously, will have to be done by humans for the time being, because lawyers and judges will definitely resist permitting robots to do so for the foreseeable future. Most of the work I do right now, relies mostly on written submissions to judges (which I think will soon be done by AI almost exclusively), or haggling in mediation, which I think is relatively safe for humans for the foreseeable future.

AI: You're painting a picture where the profession is likely to stratify - with AI handling routine work and humans focusing on high-stakes negotiation and creative legal arguments. That's quite a transformation to anticipate.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your own relationship with AI at work evolving as these changes unfold?

User: I hope to find a job that requires my physical presence, and to find my niche in personal interactions. To be honest, I do not know that I will remain in the practice of law for my whole career. In the near-future, I will certainly continue to use AI for many of my tasks, probably more and more as it gets better and better.

AI: That's quite a shift to consider - potentially moving away from law toward work that emphasizes physical presence and personal interaction. It sounds like you're being very strategic about positioning yourself for a world where those human elements become more valuable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your story?

User: No

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on anticipating how society might place a premium on genuine human interactions as AI becomes more prevalent - that historical and science-fiction lens you bring seems to give you a unique way of thinking about these changes.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution of professional work and the strategic value of human connection will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
