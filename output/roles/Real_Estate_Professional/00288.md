Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically don't use AI in my workday. The only thing I use it for is when I need to edit photos; then I use AI features in Adobe Photoshop.

AI: That's interesting - so photo editing with Photoshop's AI features is your main touchpoint with AI at work. 

Tell me more about that. What specific types of photo editing do you find yourself using those AI features for?

User: When editing photos I sometimes need to remove signs of trash or cars in photos of buildings.

AI: I see - so you're using AI to clean up architectural or building photos by removing unwanted elements like trash or cars. That sounds like it could be quite useful for your work.

What kind of work involves photographing buildings? Are you in real estate, architecture, or something else?

User: I am in real estate.

AI: That makes perfect sense - having clean, appealing photos of properties would be really important for your listings.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your real estate work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I use the Microsoft Office suite of programs which I know have AI features in Outlook. I guess I occasionally use the feature where it provides suggestions when you're typing an email but I only ever use it for a few words.

AI: That's helpful to know - so you do use the email suggestion feature occasionally, but just for short phrases. 

When you think about other aspects of your real estate work - like writing property descriptions, market research, client communications, or scheduling - are there areas where you consciously choose to handle things yourself rather than exploring what AI might offer? What drives those choices for you?

User: I don't do much writing, so I don't use AI for that. I send a lot of emails to clients but I'd prefer to type the emails myself because I feel like personalized communication is important and I don't want my responses to sound robotic.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - prioritizing that personal touch in client communications. It sounds like maintaining authentic relationships with your clients is important to you.

When you do use AI - whether it's the photo editing in Photoshop or those occasional email suggestions - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to set it up to handle something and then review the results?

User: I collaborate throughout the process. I want to see the process because I want to know what's going on so that if something goes awry I can fix it immediately, and so I can make sure I don't accidentally leave those errors in my work.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining oversight and being able to course-correct in real time. It sounds like you value understanding what's happening rather than just getting an end result.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others in real estate are approaching AI tools differently than you are?

User: I don't think other people in my company are using AI that much more than I am. I think our company limits which tools we can use in order to ensure that work is of a certain standard.

AI: Interesting - so there are company policies that shape what AI tools are available to you. That quality control aspect makes sense for maintaining professional standards.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Again, I don't use AI that much, but I find using it in Photoshop very satisfying. What used to take me an hour or so, manually editing a photo, can now take just a minute. It's amazing to see how much time the technology can save me.

AI: That's a powerful example - going from an hour of manual work to just a minute is quite a transformation. That time savings must make a real difference in your workflow.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given how much the photo editing process has changed for you?

User: Photo editing is just one small part of my job. I'm not concerned about AI taking over because my job consists of a lot of different small things and although I'm sure that AI could do all of them, it's the coordination of those small parts that, I think, require a human to oversee.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the orchestration and coordination of all those different moving parts is what you see as the distinctly human element.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue with this more limited, tool-specific approach, or might that change over time?

User: I think that as long as I'm in the same position, working for the same person, that I am now, my relationship with AI at work won't change much. If and when I have to work for a different person, my role and responsibilities will change, and at that point I may find a need for integrating more AI into my job.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the coordination and oversight aspects of your role remain distinctly human, even as individual tasks become more automated.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all I can think of for now.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that human oversight role, the importance of personal touch in client communications, and how company policies shape AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
