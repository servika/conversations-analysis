Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a project manager for a firm that does business and real estate development. One part of my job is to manage social media content for some of the businesses we are developing. I use AI to help generate post ideas and caption content. I am also in charge of hiring and interviewing for the businesses we are developing. I have used AI to help refine job descriptions and write interview questions.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across quite different areas of your work. 

When you're working on those social media posts or job descriptions, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you start with AI-generated content and then modify it, or do you approach it differently?

User: With the social media aspect of my job, I tell the AI the type of account I am working on (ie who is the target audience demographic, what is the "vibe" of the account) and have it recommend generic post ideas for me. So, if it says I should do a post of a sunset with a caption about golden hour I then take that information, look for an appropriate photo, and edit the caption until it fits my needs. For the job descriptions, I typically write the job descriptions myself and then ask the AI to review and make suggestions to make the writing stronger. Or, I'll give it the job description and ask it to provide 3-5 interview questions based on the job description I have already written.

AI: That's a really clear picture of how you're using AI as more of a collaborative partner rather than having it do the complete task. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to handle initial writing tasks myself so that I can ensure the work is my own and is not fully generated by AI. For example, I might have AI review a job description or email I have written and make suggestions- this way, the original content is generated by me and I can choose whether I want to incorporate the suggestions or not. I think I do this because I value authenticity in my work. It's okay with me morally if AI helps make improvements but the original product is my own. It's not cool if I have AI do every step of the process for me- it's lazy and unoriginal.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making about authenticity and ownership of your work. It sounds like maintaining that original creative input is important to you.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with how others at your firm are using these tools?

User: I am the youngest at my firm by decades and I know for a fact that none of my colleagues are using AI - they do not trust it. I believe our front office receptionist uses AI to write her emails. I've noticed some of the typical markers of AI writing in her emails over the last few months that weren't there before. Overall, I am not influenced by any of my colleagues in my AI usage. I like to stay on top of news related to evolving AI capabilities and will research and explore different AI tools and utilize them as I see fit. It's a personal decision not influenced by my firm.

AI: That's fascinating - you're really pioneering AI use at your firm. It sounds like you're making these decisions quite independently.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had a social media project dropped in my lap last minute that needed content to post ASAP. I do not really like working on social media and so was happy to write up a description of the the channel, desired post tone, and target audience and let AI make suggestions for post content and captions. I asked my chatbot to generate 3-5 ideas. It provided 5 and I liked 2 of them enough to move forward. The captions weren't perfect so I asked for alternative versions of the 2 posts that I was moving forward with and then was able to further refine the alternative suggestions into something usable. I accessed an online database of licensable stock photos to find images to match the post suggestions and was able to get content posted relatively quickly.

AI: That sounds like a really smooth workflow when you were under pressure. The way you describe refining those captions through multiple iterations is interesting.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Honestly, I don't see AI being able to "take over" my job. AI tools are useful but ultimately fallible. My job involves managing timelines, overseeing budgets, producing reports, creating graphics and presentations, managing people and different personalities, and executing in-person events and activations. AI may be able to help automate some of the generic tasks - like sitting through a project update meeting and taking note of the status of different items - but I have not see anything to suggest that there is an AI tool capable of then taking those project notes and turning them into the next steps that I flow through on a daily basis. For example, I might have to then go have lunch with the owner of a local vendor to smooth over the frustration expressed by his team in the meeting. AI can't do that. I might have to drive to a project site to inspect building progress and take photos for the legal team. AI can't do that. In terms of skill maintenance, I have two graduate degrees (one focused in technology experience design) and actively pursue continuing education to make sure I am up-to-date in my field. Overall, I am not concerned about an AI "takeover." I'm much more concerned about people becoming overly reliant on AI tools to the detriment of their own skills.

AI: That's a really comprehensive view of how AI fits into the broader context of your work - especially those human relationship and physical presence aspects that require you to be there in person.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the tools develop or as your comfort level changes?

User: If AI develops more capabilities that I can use to streamline my work process I would definitely implement it. I am comfortable using AI so I don't think my comfortability will really affect whether or not I use AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining authenticity by ensuring the original work comes from you, and your nuanced view of AI as a helpful tool rather than something that could replace the complex, interpersonal aspects of project management.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I would add that I used to work in education and saw many issues with student use of AI in a way that was academically dishonest. I do not see this kind of abuse of AI's capabilities now that I am no longer working with students.

AI: That's a really valuable addition - the contrast between academic and professional contexts when it comes to AI use is quite striking. It sounds like the stakes and motivations are quite different in your current work environment.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining authenticity, working independently of workplace culture, and viewing AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about these questions!

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Take care, and thanks again for participating in our research.
