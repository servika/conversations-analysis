Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good to me

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Most of my work i cant use AI for as it is very practical and hands on. However, i am an apprentice so AI comes in very helpful for that part of my job. i use this to help me structure assignments and also for research purposes to find the most up to date methods. As a student veterinary nurse I have to fill in an NPL. I use AI for this to structure the paragraphs where i explain what i did and to ensure it is within the word count. Evidence based nursing is a very important part of my job which basically means using the most up to date research in work. So i have been using AI to find new ideas that i can bring into my job.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves as a bridge between your academic learning and practical application. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for evidence-based nursing research. When you're looking for new ideas to bring into your job, how do you go about that process with AI?

User: Most of the uses I've had so far is updating my knowledge on anesthetic monitoring and what the different bits of equipment can be used for. I have also used it to research up to date methods for perioperative temperature monitoring as in practice i noticed a few patients where becoming cold. This was extremely useful as it showed me some new ideas we could use to keep the animals warm all the way through the op and into recovery. I have also briefly used it to come up with simple enrichment ideas for the inpatients such as using cardboard tubes as treat puzzles.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI to actively solve real problems you're encountering in practice, like the temperature monitoring issue with patients getting cold. 

When you discover these new methods or ideas through AI, how do you typically bring them into your workplace? Do you implement them yourself, or do you need to go through other people first?

User: I need to have things pre approved from my management team before i can implement them in practice. But if its a good idea then they are very happy for me to trail the new ideas as they are always wanting to improve the practice

AI: That sounds like a supportive environment for innovation. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When it comes to writing college assignments they need to be in my own words so i cany use AI to help me structure them or I could get in trouble. However, I can still use AI to help me with my research. Another task that I could maybe ask AI to help me with is drug calculations and dose rates for the animals but because its an animals life in my hands i would prefer to do the calculation myself to ensure it is correct rather than the quicker option that would be AI. But if the AI did the calculation wrong and i didnt notice then it could have very drastic consiquences

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - especially about drug calculations where the stakes are so high. The responsibility you feel for the animals' safety really comes through.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Its definitely a mix of the two and most of the time it depends on how good the response the AI gave me was. If the responses are really good then I am more than happy for it to do the task independently. But some responses that AI gives are almost right but need some changes to make them appropriate for what i was asking.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're evaluating the quality and adjusting your approach based on what you get back.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time that i found it frustrating was when i was asking it to help me with a gas and electric query I was having. My gas company had quoted me an expensive bill for my monthly usage which didn't seem correct but i didn't have any idea how to work out gas costs by myself so i asked AI. The AI told me that i was right and did the working out for me and came up with an email response i could send the company. However when i got the email back the company said my workings out where wrong. So i went back to AI and asked it if they where correct and it said yes, its previous response was incorrect. This was extremely frustrating as i had kicked up a bit of a fuss with the gas company and turns out i was wrong for having done it. A time i found it very satisfying was when i was using it to help me with my assignment word count and to word thing better. It did an amazing job at cutting down my paragraph to within the set wordcount and also changed a few words to make the sentences flow so much better.

AI: That gas bill situation sounds really frustrating - especially when you acted on the AI's advice and then had to deal with the fallout when it turned out to be wrong. That's a tough spot to be in.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As most of my job is practical I don't take this into consideration too often. However i think i could work along side of AI to enhance my skills through evidence based nursing as the AI will have access to all the most up to date information.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - seeing AI as a way to enhance your skills through access to current information rather than something that might replace what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see some aspects working together really well but as my job is very practical i think the relationship wont be a close one. Especially seen as when i pass my nursing studies i wont need to use it for my assignments. However, with nursing its all about continuous learning so AI will always come in helpful.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance using AI for research and learning while maintaining personal responsibility for critical decisions like drug calculations - that shows a really mature approach to integrating these tools safely.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: i cant think of anything, thank you for your time!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as an apprentice veterinary nurse - especially how you navigate the balance between leveraging AI for learning while maintaining safety standards for patient care - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Take care!
