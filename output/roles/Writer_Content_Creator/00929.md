Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: It depends on the project I'm working on. In many cases, I use AI as a starting point for research. Often, my projects require specific types of resources that can be difficult to find, such as information on .gov sites. If I can get a tentative answer on something from a chatbot, I can often use that as a starting point for search engines so that I can more easily locate valid resources for my projects. However, other days, I use AI specifically to generate project briefs that will be used by myself or other writers to create content for prominent clients.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI in quite different ways depending on the situation. 

Tell me more about those project briefs you mentioned. When you're creating briefs for yourself or other writers, what does that process typically look like?

User: I'll typically have a template based on specific client guidelines. For example, the template will include things like tone (professional, casual, friendly, etc.), word counts, required section headers, links to include, whether or not the client requires the Oxford comma, etc. I'll feed that template into the model and then give it the subject for this particular article. For example, let's say the client is a genealogy site and my company is providing value-add articles. If we're doing articles on different holidays I might have a template for a specific holiday and then tell the AI to create a new brief in that format for a different holiday.

AI: So you're essentially using the AI to replicate a format you've already established but adapt it for new content topics. 

When you hand those AI-generated briefs to other writers, how do they typically respond to working from something that was created by AI? Do they know it came from AI, and does that affect how they use it?

User: For me, there's usually a middle man - a project manager that's assigned me these templates to  create as paying work. The templates are then handed out to the writers by that project manager so I don't typically get that feedback and I don't think that most of the writers know that these briefs are AI-generated. As long as they provide all the information the writer know, they probably don't really care.

AI: That makes sense - if the brief has all the necessary information, the origin probably doesn't matter much to the writer doing the work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I would never use AI to write my articles. First of all, my employer forbids that in most circumstances and doing so could get me fired. However, I wouldn't want to do that anyway. I'm a writer. Why would I want a chatbot to write something that I could write (maybe better)? Plus, I'm a high-level writer at my company, so there are certain expectations that I wouldn't trust the chatbot to fulfill. I'm fine with giving AI supporting tasks, but I still want to be the star of the show when it comes to the actual written content.

AI: That's a clear distinction - you're comfortable with AI handling the supporting work but want to maintain control over the core creative output. 

When you say you're a "high-level writer" with certain expectations, what are those specific expectations that you wouldn't trust a chatbot to fulfill?

User: Where I work, we're rated as writers based on our experience and skill level. I'm a four-star writer, which is the top tier. I'm also considered for the most sensitive work and highest-priority clients because I'm considered at the top of that top tier. That means I'm able to adapt my writer's voice to create what a client wants, to make articles engaging and informative, to make sure everything in them is true and appropriate for the company, and that everything meets the specifications outlined in the project brief.

AI: So you're essentially trusted with the most complex and sensitive work because of your proven ability to deliver exactly what clients need. 

When you do use AI for those supporting tasks like research and brief creation, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to use it here and there honestly. I do use AI more when I have a research-heavy piece, especially when it's something that has difficult-to-find information. For example, I like when I can ask a question about the topic I'm working on. Then once I "know" the answer based on the AI's response, I find it easier to verify the information from a source that meets certain criteria.

AI: So you're using AI almost like a research assistant to point you in the right direction, then doing the verification work yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned your employer has restrictions - how does that shape how you and others approach using these tools?

User: I'm very careful. My employer prides itself on delivering human-generated content, so using AI to generate content unless it's for a specific hybrid human-AI project is a big NO-NO. My employer also spot-checks work with AI checkers to make sure people aren't submitting work that's AI generated. (Note: they are). I have a solid reputation with the company, so I don't worry TOO much about it, but the thought is still there and I always worry that something I've written completely on my own could still get flagged by an AI checker.

AI: That's a really interesting tension - you're confident in your own work but still concerned about false positives from AI detection tools. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time, when I was working on those templates, they were for articles about different state-specific holidays and the AI I was using kept making them too short despite being told very specifically what word count to aim for. It also kept providing hallucinated links to include in the articles. It had been fine for most of the articles, but then every once in a while I'd have these problems and would have to keep trying again to finesse the articles. I was getting paid per brief, so that really affected how much I was getting paid per hour.

AI: That sounds frustrating - especially when it's affecting your pay rate. The inconsistency must make it hard to predict how much time a task will actually take.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do actively consider this, and I think AI is keeping me on my toes. When ChatGPT first became a big thing, my copywriting work disappeared almost overnight. One day I had more work than I could handle and was turning it away and the next it was just gone. Some of it came back for higher-level copywriters like me, but my company ended up letting go of most of the lower-level copywriters.  I think, though, that it makes me work harder to keep up my skillset so I can compete. I heard an industry insider say once that if you can't write better than AI, you should hang up your copywriter's hat. I think that's true right now.

AI: That's a significant shift - going from turning away work to watching colleagues lose their jobs almost overnight. It sounds like you've had to really prove your value in a new landscape.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: My company is pivoting to a hybrid model. While we're still primarily advertising human-generated content, there is a new team (me included) that will be pairing AI-generated content with human writers and editors who can finesse it to the company's specifications. I think people like me, who are reasonably knowledgeable about working with AI, and who aren't averse to working with it (many writers flat-out refuse to work with this technology for ethical reasons that I understand but don't wholly agree with) are going to have other opportunities to replace the work that's gone. At least I hope so. My worry is that if low-level workers are replaced, these are often people who are starting out or learning, so what will that mean for the future of human copywriting and content writing?

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about the broader implications - if entry-level positions disappear, how do people develop the skills to eventually become high-level writers like yourself?

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about navigating this changing landscape as a professional writer. I particularly found your point about AI keeping you "on your toes" compelling - this idea that it's both a threat and something that pushes you to maintain your competitive edge.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I'd just like to mention that I am also a traditionally published novelist and that I've found great ways to incorporate AI into that work, as well, such as finding comp titles, continuity editing, and outlining synopses. However, it's a difficult dance as many creatives are so averse to AI and agents are now asking if any part of your query package has been written by AI.

AI: That's a fascinating additional layer - you're navigating AI use across two different creative industries that each have their own concerns and expectations around authenticity.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about adapting to this rapidly changing landscape - both in commercial writing and literary publishing - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. You've given us a really nuanced view of what it's like to be a creative professional working alongside these tools while maintaining your own expertise and reputation.
