Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm primarily a writer and I'm currently in the preliminary phase of writing my first novel. This phase of writing involves research into the philosophical and historical grounding of the story. This involves an enormous amount of archival research and reading in philosophy and history,  and a little bit of writing.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating and intensive process. The combination of archival research, philosophy, and history for a novel must involve digging through so many different sources and ideas.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI to do a particular kind of brainstorming-- the AI is my philosophical interlocutor. My writing process involves thinking through concepts that I've read from philosophy, history and literary criticism. I use the AI to discuss these concepts and refine my thoughts. Sometimes the AI can help explain difficult concepts to me or correct the errors of my thinking. The purpose of tarrying with philosophy is to help ground refine the story's philosophical and historical implications. The AI can also recommend books on a particular subject. For example, if I want a history book on Canada written from the Marxist perspective, the AI can provide a list of titles for me. If I need help with a concept like Walter Benjamin's concept of the "dialectical image", a brief conversation with the AI can clarify how this concept would work in fiction.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a philosophical conversation partner to work through complex ideas. It sounds like you're using it both for clarification and as a thinking partner to refine your own conceptual understanding.

Can you describe a specific recent project or conversation where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: My novel is set in Southern Ontario in the 2010s, a period when thousands of Ontarian's lost their jobs to factory closings. The main character, a history graduate with a bachelor's degree finds himself unemployed, and musing about the founding of the Canadian Confederation. I wanted to frame a passage in the novel like a montage of dialectical images that flash between the founding of the Confederation. I engage the AI in a conversation about Walter Benjamin's paper on the philosophy of history which I used to clarify Benjamin's terminology and his philosophy of history more broadly. I then asked for some Marxist history books on the founding of Canada and it recommended "Rebels Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History" by Ian McKay. The conversation felt quite stimulating and led to some productive writing sessions for me. I keep the same conversation channel with the AI open and revisit it daily, discussing different philosophers and historical events.

AI: That sounds like a really rich creative partnership you've developed - having that ongoing conversation thread where you can return daily to explore different thinkers and events. The connection between Benjamin's dialectical images and your character's situation in 2010s Ontario is compelling.

When you're in those conversations with AI about philosophy and history, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions about how these concepts will actually appear in your novel?

User: I have a background in philosophy and literary criticism, and the story is entirely original, so all of the creative decision are ultimately mine. I do not ask the AI for feedback about the quality of my work. I used it as an interlocutor to help refine and clarify my thinking.

AI: That's a clear distinction - the AI as a thinking partner for clarification rather than a creative collaborator or critic. It sounds like you maintain full creative authority while using it as a tool to sharpen your philosophical understanding.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: AI saves me an enormous amount of research time and often manages to recommend interesting texts on my chosen subjects. While its ability to synthesize philosophical concepts is not perfect, it is a useful sounding board and can also help critique text's from philosophical papers and books that I copy and paste into its chat window.

AI: So it's really streamlined that research and discovery phase for you - both in finding relevant texts and in working through complex philosophical material more efficiently.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in writing more broadly?

User: None.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: If AI can improve its research capabilities, I can see it permanently changing the way literature is written and even creating new audiences for more philosophically stimulating stories told through various forms of media. While the novel might die out and cinema might become old fashioned, there are an increasing number of vehicles for storytelling like VR and Video Games that will require writers. I can see AI creating a more intellectually stimulating popular culture in the next few years.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - AI potentially elevating the intellectual depth of popular culture and opening up new storytelling mediums. You see it as expanding rather than limiting creative possibilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience using AI as a philosophical interlocutor in your research process. I particularly appreciated how you've carved out such a specific and disciplined use of AI - maintaining creative control while leveraging it for conceptual clarification and research efficiency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a philosophical conversation partner while maintaining clear creative boundaries will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've integrated AI into such a specific part of your process - that research and conceptual development phase - while keeping the creative decisions entirely in your hands. Best of luck with your novel!
