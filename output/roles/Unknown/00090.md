Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Ok, great. That sounds good to me. I don't have any questions for you yet.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me with several tasks, such as generating meeting agendas, minutes, organizing client schedules, writing professional emails, or business letters. I also use it to help me identify songs I'm listening to throughout the work day or to answer factual questions when I'm curious about something I'm working on or can't recall a data point.

AI: That's a really diverse range of uses. It sounds like AI helps you with both core work tasks like those meeting agendas and emails, as well as more spontaneous needs like identifying songs or quick factual lookups.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do prefer to work on spreadsheets or preparing data for presentation myself. Most of the time, AI is helpful with improving written communication or quick fact-finding, but I haven't had the same good luck with instruction following when it comes to summarizing and reformatting large amounts of raw data into an aesthetically pleasing, presentation style format.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found AI excels at certain types of tasks but struggles with the more complex data work that requires both analytical precision and design sensibilities.

When you use AI for those tasks where it does work well - like the meeting agendas or professional emails - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I normally work with the model throughout the task. I often have a basic, general idea in mind that I share with the model and will make changes after I see the AI's interpretation of my instructions. AI usually does a great job and doesn't fail to deliver on the prompt, but seeing its version of my idea and working through drafts together helps inspire me to improve the final product as well.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really valuable - where the AI's interpretation actually sparks new ideas for you to build on together. It's like having a thinking partner that helps you refine your own vision.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues have sought assistance from different AI models in their daily tasks, which has made me feel more comfortable in doing so. Use of AI has not been officially supported or discouraged at my company, so my coworkers and I tend use it for lower stakes tasks.

AI: So it sounds like there's this informal, grassroots adoption happening among you and your colleagues, but without clear organizational guidance you're all naturally gravitating toward using it for safer, lower-risk work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure, I have an example of each situation. A satisfying moment was when I left my previous job of [REDACTED] years. I asked AI to help me write a goodbye email to my colleagues. I wanted the letter to feel appreciative, warm, and positive, yet still professional or academic. I worked with the model to craft a well-written email that my coworkers responded to kindly, and the whole process only took about 10 minutes. Conversely, I felt frustrated using AI to help me identify a piece of artwork that I wanted to use in a company campaign. I uploaded the image several times, but AI didn't seem to correctly identify it. I wound up finding the artist's name on my own and contacted him to ask for permission to use his work.

AI: Those are such vivid examples of the spectrum of AI performance. Your goodbye email story really highlights how AI can help capture the right tone for emotionally significant moments - getting that balance of warmth and professionalism just right in such a short time. 

But the artwork identification struggle shows those clear limits, especially when you need that specific, accurate information for something like copyright permissions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think working with AI is more likely to help me improve my own skills. I work independently for most of the workday, and it's nice to have AI to bounce ideas around with and to collaborate with to generate the best possible version of a task. I don't think I would like to completely delegate tasks to AI because I worry that my competency with certain skills might decline over time due to lack of practice.

AI: That's a thoughtful balance you've struck - using AI as that collaborative partner while staying actively engaged to maintain your own abilities. It sounds like you see AI as enhancing rather than replacing your skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: That all depends on what path my company decides to take as AI becomes more prevalent in the workplace. If my company decides to officially support certain AI models and integrate them into our work, I will be happy to use its assistance with more complicated tasks.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're ready to expand your AI usage but waiting to see how your organization formally approaches it before diving into higher-stakes work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative thinking partner rather than just a task-completion tool, and how you're being strategic about maintaining your own skills while still benefiting from AI assistance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I believe we've covered everything we need to today. Thank you for your thoughtful responses. It's been nice conversing with you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that collaborative approach to AI - using it as a thinking partner while staying engaged to maintain your own skills - have been incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and limitations you've encountered. These kinds of real-world perspectives are exactly what help us understand how AI is actually being integrated into work environments.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
