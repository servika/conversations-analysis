Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. Let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: At present, in my work as a writer, I tend to use AI when I need to take large bodies of text or information and condense this down into key points or summaries. 

For example, one client (an arts website) regularly commissions me to write exhibition and venue listings. For each listing, I feed the AI bot as much relevant information as I can, then I provide a set of instructions with strict parameters. I then take the final text and rewrite it in my own voice.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow. When you say you "rewrite it in my own voice" after getting the AI output - what does that process look like for you? Are you making small tweaks or doing more substantial rewriting?

User: Both. Given I'm paid as a writer, I think it's important that I do my own work and construct texts in my personal style.  That said, I do provide information on sentence construction, preferred conjugations and phrasing to avoid, all in an attempt to nudge the AI towards my voice.

AI: That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: For sure: writing. Anything truly creative, really. Otherwise, what's the point in me doing what I do?

AI: Can you tell me more about what distinguishes "truly creative" work for you? Where do you draw that line between what feels worth delegating versus what you want to keep for yourself?

User: Well, a client has commissioned me to write something that they could, if we're being realistic, have asked an AI to do themselves. There's a reason they want a human to write, and that's because each individual brings something different to the written word. LLMs are founded upon pre-existing information, whereas the human brain can come up with entirely new concepts and ideas.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Collaboration. There's a lot of tweaking, going back and forth.

AI: Tell me more about that back and forth process. What does that collaboration look like in practice?

User: Say I provide my original prompt, along with a large amount of information for the AI to work from. The AI responds with something that's not quite hitting the mark, so I refine my prompt and go again. I'll keep doing this until I get closer to where I want to be.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They haven't, I don't think.

AI: Interesting. As a writer, do you discuss AI use with other writers or clients at all, or is it something you tend to keep to yourself?

User: Not at work. I think lots of people are cagey about it. Many writers admit it's a useful tool, but are critical of its creative capacities.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently had a proofreading project that was extremely frustrating, as the AI model kept making serious mistakes (despite being a paid for, premium account). I ended up doing twice the work, as I couldn't trust it.

AI: That sounds really frustrating. What kinds of mistakes was it making that broke your trust? And how did you handle completing the project after that experience?

User: Missing things that shouldn't have been missed, correcting things that shouldn't have been corrected. I supplied PDF pages and it didn't understand how to read them properly.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: To be honest, I fully anticipate that the kind of work I've mentioned – listings, proofreading – will become defunct as the models become stronger. My other work as a commissioning editor feels safer, as this is interpersonal, so I will have to focus my attention more on that kind of work.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to keep using it as a tool, but will avoid leaning on it too heavily in order to avoid blunting my skill set.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining the creative elements that make human writing valuable while still finding practical uses for AI as a tool.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all. Thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating the balance between leveraging AI as a practical tool while preserving the creative core of your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
