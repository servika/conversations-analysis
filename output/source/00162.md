Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily sell gently used books online, on sites like eBay. I use AI primarily when crafting descriptions of said books. I really dislike this part of my job and am grateful that AI tools help me out here.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has taken over a part of your work that you find particularly tedious. 

Tell me more about what you dislike about crafting those book descriptions. What specifically makes that task challenging or unenjoyable for you?

User: It takes a lot of time and I'm not all that great with words. I find that AI does a better job of understanding the book's summary and overall condition, given the few details I provide, and just does a better job of it. AI saves me a lot of time, which is most important to me. I don't like wasting time.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - time efficiency is clearly important in your business. 

When you say AI does a better job of understanding the book's summary and condition from the details you provide, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you interact with the AI to get those descriptions written?

User: I supply keywords and a basic summary and it pretty much takes it from there. It rewrites everything in a professional way, much quicker than I could ever do.

AI: So it sounds like you give the AI the raw material and it handles the transformation into polished descriptions. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your book selling business that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I like to take my own photos of each book, when possible, but if there was an AI tool to help with that process, that would be great. Taking clear, detailed photos of each book is time consuming. I enjoy it, though. For the most part. It's actually one of the reasons I got into book selling. Photography is just as much a passion of mine as books are.

AI: That's fascinating - so photography represents the creative, enjoyable side of your work that you want to keep for yourself, even though it's time-consuming. It sounds like that task connects to your personal interests and passions in a way that writing descriptions doesn't.

When you use AI for those book descriptions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine the description, or do you tend to give it your initial input and let it handle the task independently?

User: Yes, the photography aspect is what I like most about my job. Besides the books themselves! As for using the AI itself, I generally just go ahead and use whatever it's drafted as it's spot on more times than not. It's a very basic process, but I like that about it. The simpler AI is to use, the more I like it.

AI: That simplicity seems really important to you - a straightforward input-output process that just works. 

How have your colleagues or others in the book selling community influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you discussed AI tools with other sellers, or has your approach developed more independently?

User: I see other sellers using the same tools I do, it's hard not to notice, as it provides descriptions in a very typical format, but we don't really discuss it. Well, at least I don't. I think using AI is kind of expected, though. It's more beneficial than harmful. I believe that's the general consensus.

AI: Interesting - so there's almost an unspoken recognition that AI use has become part of the landscape, even without direct conversations about it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used to write out all my descriptions myself and it was just so time-consuming. I finally decided to use AI to help write the descriptions and it's been a real game-changer. My output has increased and as a result I'm seeing more sales, which has been a real blessing.

AI: That sounds like a really significant shift for your business - increased output leading to more sales. That must have been quite satisfying to see that direct impact.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially when it comes to writing descriptions or other aspects of your work?

User: I'm not sure what else it could take over in my specific business. I still think you'll need people to source books directly, for example. I'd like to maintain the skills I have now with AI and would enjoy expanding on them if needed.

AI: That's a practical perspective - focusing on expanding your AI skills rather than worrying about replacement in areas that still need human judgment like sourcing.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself incorporating it into other parts of your business, or are you pretty content with how you're using it now?

User: I'd love to incorporate it into my business as long as I'm able and it's helpful. I'd especially like to use an AI tool to help me take better pictures.

AI: That's really interesting - you mentioned earlier that photography is one of the parts you most enjoy about your work, yet you'd also welcome AI assistance with it. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found AI to be a practical solution that allows you to focus more on the aspects of your work you truly enjoy, like photography and working with the books themselves.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I'd welcome it if it made my job taking photos easier. I really do enjoy that part of my job, but like I said before, what's most important to me is saving time. If AI helps me do that, I'm 100% on board. I can use the free time AI saves me to pursue other creative aspects outside of work! Overall, I'm super happy with the way AI has been able to help me accomplish so much more at work, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for it.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing that perspective - it's really insightful how you see AI as a tool that not only improves your work efficiency but also frees up time for creativity outside of work. That's a wonderful way to think about the balance.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can enhance productivity while preserving the enjoyable aspects of work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
