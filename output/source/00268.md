Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for multiple tasks, but primarily for communications (emails, refining messages, or just taking a draft messages and formatting it), coding (through tools like Cursor), research (market research, finding tools, competing companies etc...) and more.

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses. You mentioned communications, coding, and research as your main areas. 

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI for one of these tasks? For instance, when you're working on communications - what does that process actually look like for you?

User: For communications, I would for example paste an email I received to the AI agent, and say that I want the reply to be in this given tone (friendly, professional etc...) and that the answer should state that XYZ without worrying about wording. I let the AI select the correct wording and formatting to have a ready to send message.

AI: That's really helpful - so you're giving the AI the key content points and tone direction, then letting it handle the specific wording and formatting.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, for example code review. AI tends to overcomplicate reviews, or miss key inefficiencies due to a lack of context. Any task that requires a broader context to be properly achieved and where the context is not easily transferrable to the AI model's context, I prefer to handle on my own.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the context piece seems crucial for you in deciding what to delegate versus keep.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I rarely delegate completely. I use AI as a co-pilot for most tasks, it helps me with certain aspects of the task and I always validate the work afterwards.

AI: That co-pilot approach makes a lot of sense, especially given what you said about context being so important.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work at an AI company, so the use of AI is baked into the core essence of what we are building. This certainly helped created a favorable environment for myself as much as it did for my colleagues.

AI: That's fascinating - working at an AI company must create a very different dynamic around AI adoption than most workplaces experience.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can share a time where I got frustrated. I was brainstorming ideas for my startup, and chose to ask AI for names. I said that I wanted the name to be short and to the point (like Ester), without using any double word (like CodeName). It kept giving me company names that already existed or that didn't follow my instructions, and none of the suggested names were appealing. That's when I stopped using AI for creative brainstorming.

AI: That's a really telling example - it sounds like the AI wasn't picking up on the specific creative direction you had in mind, and maybe wasn't doing the due diligence on existing company names either.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I believe AI will indeed take over some roles and areas, and I believe the way to stay ahead of the curve is to work in the AI space, since I don't foresee AI working on itself becoming a reality any time soon.

AI: That's a strategic perspective - positioning yourself in the AI space itself as a way to stay relevant. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think as models keep getting better and context windows larger, the possibilities will keep expanding. I could see a near future where AI is aware of both my calendar, my code bases, legal documents and can act like a true co-pilot in my life, both professional and personal.

AI: That vision of AI having access to all your different work streams and acting as a true integrated co-pilot is really compelling.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how context limitations drive your decisions about what to delegate versus handle yourself, and that interesting contrast between your positive co-pilot experiences and the frustrating creative brainstorming session.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the co-pilot approach, the importance of context in task delegation, and how working in the AI space itself shapes your perspective will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
