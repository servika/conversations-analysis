Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: As the owner of a creative services business primarily geared towards music, a typical project for me could be anything from basic level songwriting to arranging the musical direction of a multi faceted performance, composing music for film or even programming a live production from start to finish.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly diverse range of creative work - from intimate songwriting all the way up to orchestrating entire live productions. With such variety in your projects, I'm curious about how technology fits into your process.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find myself reaching for AI tools to spark kernels of creativity when inspiration is feeling scarce. A quick brainstorm with a chatbot or a visualization with an image generator often facilitates my workflow into being proactive rather than simply waiting around for inspiration to strike.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a creativity catalyst when you're feeling stuck rather than waiting passively for inspiration. It sounds like AI helps you shift from a more passive to active creative stance.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was recently asked to pitch a song for a client with a sizeable repertoire that includes many different "eras" of themselves. While trying to capture the energy and feeling of a specific time in their career, I asked an LLM to analyze the lyrics of a few popular songs from this artist's reference period to find a common link or meaning. In this instance, the LLM was able to capture the underlying vibe of the era and provide some suggestions of themes for me to lead off the lyrics with. Although I had already written the majority of the music, the suggestions lead me to view the piece in a different light and make some changes that I would not have made otherwise. The client loved one moment in particular that was heavily influenced by one of the creative tangents that was inspired by the original LLM conversation.

AI: That's a fascinating example - using AI to decode the thematic DNA of a specific era in an artist's work. It sounds like the AI helped you see patterns or connections you might not have noticed on your own, which then influenced both your lyrical approach and even the musical arrangement you'd already written.

When you're working with AI in situations like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I view the collaboration similarly as a I would with a human if the human could produce ideas extremely fast. Having AI suggest however many ideas I need to curate into a starting point for my own creativity is the most common collaboration, retaining the overall creative decisions for myself.

AI: That's a really clear way to frame it - AI as a rapid idea generator that you then curate and build from. It sounds like you maintain creative control while leveraging AI's speed to give you more raw material to work with.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I've found that I have become much less "stuck" on projects that I am struggling with finding an identity in. The use of AI as a sounding board has allowed me to often "ram through" the wall of writer's block and get the necessary creative juices flowing much more quickly.

AI: That's a powerful shift - breaking through creative blocks more efficiently rather than getting stuck in those frustrating periods where nothing seems to click. It sounds like AI has become a reliable way to unstick yourself and get back into flow.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am less concerned with AI's presence taking over work in my field as I am with clients settling for non-curated, early stage AI generative art as a cheaper alternative for their needs. There are many types of projects these days, and only some needs can be easily satisfied by the AI tools readily available.

AI: That's a nuanced concern - it's not about AI replacing your capabilities, but about clients potentially choosing lower-quality, unrefined AI output simply because it's cheaper, even when their project would benefit from the curation and expertise you bring.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I can see myself using the tools similarly to how I do now, as a base for inspiration within myself. I am definitely interested in further utilizing AI in a more assistant/administrative role eg. file naming and general organization. It would be helpful to have an assistant that could memorize and piece together the patterns I have used in other projects that were successful and apply the same personalized "tactics" to future projects that may not be as agreeable.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a rapid idea generator that helps you break through creative blocks while maintaining full creative control, and your nuanced view of the real concerns facing your industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I believe we've covered everything so far, thank you for your time!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creativity catalyst, maintaining creative control while leveraging AI's speed for ideation, and your vision for AI as a personalized creative assistant have been incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you've found ways to integrate AI that enhance rather than replace your creative process. Best of luck with your future projects!
