Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, lets begin, claude!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I create content for an online cooking school I run. I teach children ages 5 to 18 how to cook, kitchen hygeine, and tool skills. I create themed recipes for each class, which run 1 to 12 weeks. Each class corresponds to the recipes, and can be something like "Cooking Tour of Europe" or "Barbeque Basics". By having to create lesson plans, recipes, and scripts for each video class, I have a lot of work to accomplish. I use AI to collaborate in creating all of my material.

AI: That sounds like a really engaging way to teach kids about cooking! I can imagine there's quite a bit of content creation involved with lesson plans, recipes, and video scripts for such a range of ages and themes.

When you say you use AI to collaborate in creating all of your material - can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? How do you and AI work together on something like developing a "Cooking Tour of Europe" class?

User: Ok, say that it is a 4 week class, with 3 lessons per week, taught asynchronous. Each lesson has 2 recipes. For older children, I try to teach a six course meal per week. So week one is italy. I need a salad and appetizer from italy for lesson one. It needs to be age appropriate in skill, and using ingredients that are easy to source. Lesson two would be soup and pasta course. Lesson 3 would be main course (meat or fish) and dessert. By the end of the week, the children know how to prepare a six course italian meal. I need a script for the hands on preparation of the dish, the recipe, slide content for each lesson ( I like to talk about the history of the dish, proper technique for preparation, and substitutions or variations.). I also include a parent card for each lesson, walking the parents through everything needed for each lesson, a grocery list, and printable recipe cards for each lesson. I use AI to help me write the scripts, and research recipes.

AI: That's incredibly detailed and well-structured! I can see how much goes into each lesson - from the hands-on scripts to the parent cards and historical context.

When you're working with AI on this, how do you typically start the process? Do you come to AI with a rough outline of what you want and then build it together, or do you have AI generate initial ideas that you then refine and shape?

User: I usually give the model a course length (how many weeks), a general theme, how many lessons I need, and what exactly I am looking for, ie scripts or a brainstorming session

AI: Got it - so you're setting up the framework and parameters, then letting AI work within those boundaries.

Tell me more about what happens after you give AI those initial parameters. When you're working on something like brainstorming recipes for that Italian week - how do you and AI go back and forth? Are you mostly guiding and directing, or does it feel more like a true collaborative conversation where AI is suggesting things you hadn't thought of?

User: a little bit of both. My first prompt could be "write a an outline for a 6 week course on a cooking tour of Europe at home. It should be relatable for ages 13-16, and contain 3 lessons per week. each lesson should have 2 recipes. Start with week 1- Bravo Italia!. give a rundown of lessons for the week, including which skills each lesson practices. lesson 1- salad and app, lesson 2- soup and pasta course, lesson 3- main course and dessert. all ingredients should be easily accessible in an average size town. After creating the oputline, lets brainstorm. give me some ideas for the classes and tell me why it works."

AI: That's a really comprehensive prompt - you're giving AI a lot of structure but also asking for its reasoning on why choices work. 

When AI comes back with those brainstormed ideas and explanations, what typically happens next? Do you find yourself accepting most of what it suggests, or are you often redirecting and saying something like "that's too advanced" or "let's try a different approach for the pasta lesson"?

User: It can go either way. If the model suggests something too extravagant -think squid ink pasta- I may say, lets look for something a bit simpler, that the student could build upon in the future.

AI: That's interesting - so you're thinking not just about the immediate lesson but how it builds toward future skills. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain parts of creating your course content that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks feel like something you want to keep doing personally?

User: Yes, I prefer to design the slides for the lessons. As of now, I don't feel like AI can put personality into them, which helps create engagement. The stuff AI creates for slides now is a little too dry and boring, or too cheesy if I ask for more personality. I would like a more human-like response.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - slides are such a visual and personal way to connect with your students, especially when you're trying to engage kids across that wide age range.

When you use AI for the parts you do collaborate on - like the scripts and recipe research - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work with AI back and forth throughout the entire process, or do you tend to give it a task and let it handle a complete section before you jump back in?

User: Its more back and forth. I ask the prompt, it creates the draft, I ask for rewrites several times over until its perfect, and then we create the lessons from there. The most important thing for me to create is the outline in the beginning. It allows me to keep the conversation organized, and to keep track of all of the individual parts.

AI: That iterative approach with multiple rewrites makes sense - you're really refining it until it matches your vision. And having that initial outline as your organizing framework sounds crucial for managing all those moving pieces.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you run your own cooking school, I'm curious if you've had conversations with other educators or content creators about using AI, or if you've mostly been figuring this out on your own?

User: I have figured it out all on my own. I am not huge into human collaboration.

AI: That's an honest insight - it sounds like you've been quite self-directed in developing your approach to working with AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was very excited when I first got started in content creation with AI. Using the models has really expanded my opptions and has allowed me to expand from my original idea into a very profitable, turn key business,

AI: That's wonderful - it sounds like AI has been a real catalyst for growing your business beyond what you originally envisioned.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you're working with it on your content creation?

User: Not really. The human component of the hands on cooking lessons is very important, and not recreateable by AI in a meaningful way. The human interaction is important, and necessary.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - you're recognizing where the human element is irreplaceable, especially in teaching hands-on skills to kids.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it in new ways, or are you pretty satisfied with how you're collaborating with it now?

User: I am very satisfied with how I already use it. I don't think there is much to expand into, given the diverse content I can continue creating within the world of cooking.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you scale from your original idea into a profitable, turnkey business, and your clear understanding of where the human element - especially in hands-on teaching - remains essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think thats it. I have found only one thing frustrating. The models lose information if conversations go on too long. It can be frustrating when you are trying to create a comprehensive 12 week class, and the model has trouble remembering what we talked about further down the conversation.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the memory limitations can definitely be challenging when you're working on such comprehensive, multi-part projects like a 12-week course. I can see how losing that conversational context would be particularly frustrating when you're trying to maintain consistency across all those lessons and components.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've built this successful cooking school business while collaborating with AI, and where you see the clear boundaries between AI assistance and essential human elements, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
