Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: To write Excel VBA code for such standard automation tasks as open every file in this folder.  I can then write code for the actions to be done.  When a program is completed I give AI the completed code and ask it to document the code for my own reference.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found a pretty systematic way to work with AI on your VBA projects. You mentioned you handle writing the code for the specific actions yourself after AI helps with the standard automation setup.

Tell me more about that division of work. What makes you prefer to write those action parts yourself rather than having AI handle those as well?

User: I take the requirements from the business (financial sector) and

AI: I'm listening - you were saying you take the requirements from the business in the financial sector and...?

User: translate them into Excel processes and calculations.  I prefer to write these meyself rather than delegating to AI and then checking.

AI: That makes sense. When you say you prefer to write those processes and calculations yourself rather than delegating to AI and then checking - what is it about that approach that works better for you?

User: I can used my own logic.  This makes updating and debugging easier for me.

AI: That's a great point about using your own logic making things easier to maintain later. 

When you do use AI for those standard automation tasks like opening files in a folder, how do you typically interact with it? Do you go back and forth with AI as you're building that part, or do you give it the task and let it handle it completely?

User: Going back and forth sounds closer to what I do.  I use what Ai produces as a wrapper for the 'action' parts of my code.

AI: So you're using AI as a way to create the structure that your custom logic fits into. That's a really thoughtful approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your financial sector environment using AI similarly, or differently?

User: My manager who is from a coding background encourages judicious use of AI for coding.  There is a policy not to enter sensitive data into AI so purely functional code is ok.  Exactly what I do.  I am unaware of how others might be using Ai in this space.

AI: That sounds like a supportive environment with clear guidelines. It's interesting that your manager specifically encourages "judicious" use - that seems to align well with your selective approach.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Ai can write this 'wrapper' code quickly an effectively.  This is satisfying.  What is frustrating is that I then need to go back to ask it to apply my preferred coding conventions particularly in the case of naming variables.

AI: That's a really specific frustration - having to go back and forth to get the variable naming conventions right. It sounds like even though AI saves you time on the wrapper code, those extra rounds to align with your coding style add some friction.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: If I were to be asked to write from scratch such functional code, I might now need to pause and refer to notes or web sites.  So I would effectively fail this in an interview scenario.  But the real world is moving on and the skill is in knowing what AI can be best asked to do.  I am still the driver of the development process.  So I'm not so worried about maintaining such skill especially when there are so many new things to learn.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing that the skill is shifting toward knowing how to direct AI effectively rather than memorizing syntax. You mentioned you're still the driver of the development process, which seems key to how you think about it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I would expect that AI will create more of the code and be able to write code that matches my style and logic.  This might be either from 'reading' my coding standards documentation or by learning by example from my existing code.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the skill is shifting toward knowing what to ask AI to do, while you remain the driver of the development process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that thoughtful division of labor - using AI for the structural "wrapper" code while maintaining control over the business logic - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the satisfying aspects, like the quick and effective code generation, and the friction points, like getting the variable naming conventions right. Those details are exactly what help us understand the real-world dynamics of working with AI.

Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
