Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a freelance graphic designer.

AI: Tell me more about that. What kinds of projects do you typically work on as a freelance graphic designer?

User: Most of my projects are designing ads for instagram and other social media, but I also do other projects such as logo design and a little bit of web dev

AI: That sounds like a nice mix of work. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use LLMs for things like writing copy and admin work such as drafting/editing emails when communicating with clients. I also use text to image models on occasion as an alternative to stock images or for brainstorming ideas.

AI: Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was working on a project that required an illustration for a client, and the composition required a dynamic pose. Because I'm not a trained illustrator, I used a text to image model to help me create reference for anatomy.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a reference tool for anatomy. Tell me more about how that worked for you. What was that process like, and how did it compare to other ways you might have found reference material?

User: There are various posing tools online which work great and might have worked for this project, but a text to image model paired with OpenPose and ControlNet allows me to get closer to a finished result, or at least gives me a better reference than just a blank poseable dummy.

AI: When you're working with AI in that way - using text-to-image with OpenPose and ControlNet - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: 100% me. The text to image model requires a lot of tweaking to get right. I'll iterate 20-50 times to get an image that is maybe 50% of the way to what I'm envisioning and use that as a jumping off point to get what I want in a traditional digital media tool such as photoshop or illustrator. Occasionally, something the model generates might make me do something different but usually, I'm coming in with an idea and just using the model to help me execute that vision.

AI: That's a really clear picture of your process. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Finding reference or stock images takes a fraction of the time, and I can find exactly what I'm looking for.

AI: What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Many businesses are fine settling with what an LLM or a text to image model spits out without any further editing by a human. This means fewer jobs and increased competition.

AI: That sounds like a real concern. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Personally, as I am freelance and have to manage all of the admin work myself, I hope AI will become more capable at handling those aspects of my work so I can focus on the creative side. As far as how I am going to have to adapt, I think it's important for me to use and learn about the AI tools as they develop so I can know what aspects they struggle with that I as a human can still generate value.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you maintain complete creative control while using AI as a sophisticated reference tool, and your strategic thinking about staying ahead of AI's capabilities by understanding both its strengths and limitations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
