Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, that all sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an entrepreneur and I use AI a few times a week to help me with different tasks. I use it to help me draft captions for social media posts, to help me brainstorm new inventory I could carry in my business, to improve upon communications I've already drafted, and to help me plan promotions for my business.

AI: That's a really interesting range of tasks you're using AI for. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Hmmm. I prefer to handle product selection myself. I will use AI to give me general ideas of products I could carry, but then I research and select vendors and products myself. I don't trust AI to do adequate research on those types of things. Plus, I need to see the products myself and decide if they'd work in my store. I suppose I choose to do these things myself partially because it's a very subjetive part of my work.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the subjective judgment and need to physically evaluate products seems really important for that kind of decision-making.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'd say a little bit of both. I'll let it completely handle tasks like improving upon my written communications, or drafting a social media caption. But then I like to collaborate with AI for tasks related to brainstorming.

AI: That's helpful to understand how you approach different types of tasks with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I don't really have a workplace culture like most people do, as I am an entrepreneur and work for myself. I do have a few employees, but they don't use AI as far as I'm aware.

AI: Got it, that makes sense given your role as an entrepreneur.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used AI a few weeks ago to talk through the potential idea of changing the name of my business. It helped me see the pros & cons of the name change, to brainstorm different versions of a name, and then it helped me draft social media content to help me communicate the name change. It was very satisfying because it felt like an all-encompassing approach to the issue at hand.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive way AI helped you work through that decision. The fact that it could support you across multiple aspects of the same project seems particularly valuable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am a little worried that I may end up leaning too much on AI for things like content drafting, writing emails, etc. and then that my own quality of writing would decrease.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern. It sounds like you're aware of that potential trade-off between efficiency and skill maintenance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to continue to be able to use AI at my work to help me flesh out various ideas I have for my business, to continue to help me polish up my communication, and potentially even to help me in task organization & schedule management.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance delegation versus collaboration depending on the task, and your awareness of wanting to maintain your own writing skills while still benefiting from AI's help.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I forgot to say that sometimes I use AI at work to discuss through interpersonal challenges that I may have with a customer. It helps me to take a breath and think through something before I respond to a difficult customer.

AI: That's a really valuable addition - using AI as a sounding board for those challenging interpersonal situations sounds like it gives you that important pause to think things through before responding. That's quite different from the other tasks you mentioned, more like having a thought partner for difficult moments.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the balance between AI assistance and maintaining your own skills, plus the range of ways you integrate AI into different aspects of running your business, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
