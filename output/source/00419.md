Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions at this time

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to help me draft professional sounding emails between departments, predominantly. I also occasionally use it to help with planning out my day, and goals, like setting up itineraries if I'm feeling lost

AI: That's helpful context. When you're drafting those professional emails between departments, what specifically about that task makes AI useful for you? Is it the tone, the structure, or something else?

User: The tone predominantly. I'm autistic, so I can sometimes come off as very blunt or offensive, so it helps me check that what I'm saying is not more mean than I intended

AI: That makes a lot of sense. When you use AI to help with tone, how does that process typically work for you? Do you write something first and then have AI adjust it, or do you collaborate with it differently?

User: I write it and have it check me, or if I'm tight on time I'll tell it what I need and ask it to write it all, then I'll check it

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Some things like management plans I have to handle myself, because they deal with people's private information, so due to us not knowing who can access it after we type it in we err on the side of caution

AI: That's a smart approach regarding privacy. Beyond those privacy concerns, are there other types of work tasks where you find yourself preferring to handle them personally rather than using AI assistance?

User: Not really, I'd like to use AI more, as long as the data we get out of it is verifiable

AI: When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? You mentioned sometimes writing first and having it check, other times asking it to write everything - are there patterns to when you choose one approach over the other?

User: Yes. I have a job where I'm sometimes very limited for time, and how much I have to delegate to each task determines whether I write it myself or ask for help. Also, how many new staff I have to train on the day, as we regularly have new staff through

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues went too far, and put people's personal information into it to have it help them write emails, so now we have a list of approved uses, and IT keeps a weather eye on us to make sure we aren't doing anything we shouldn't be

AI: That context is really valuable. How has having that list of approved uses and the IT oversight affected your day-to-day experience with AI? Has it changed how you approach using it?

User: Not to me personally, I tended to mostly use it for more generalised tasks like email tone checking anyway :) I've always been a bit more wary of privacy

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied. I was running a new unit, and I really needed a hand planning out my day, and what I needed to do. It was supremely helpful, just at  helping me manage my stress and keep on top of my daily tasks

AI: That sounds like it was really impactful for you. What specifically about that planning help made such a difference in managing your stress and staying on top of things?

User: You know somehow when you start a new task, you brain blank and you aren't sure where to begin? Well having some ideas to start me putting one foot in front of the other was useful

AI: That's a great description of that initial overwhelm. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not overly, my tasks involve leading teams and caring for challenging people, so it would be difficult for AI to do a lot of what I do

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: AI assistance with things like camera control, door opening etc would be amazing. Like giving staff tags it detected when we approached doors and based on cameras it could decide if we were alone or not and if it was safe to open the door

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you navigate communication challenges and that moment when it helped you get unstuck with planning in your new role.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really, you were pretty thorough!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for communication support, the importance of privacy considerations, and how AI can help with that initial overwhelm when starting new tasks will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
