Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I'm ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a waitress/bartender so I use AI more for creative tasks. Helping to come up with meal and drink descriptions for the menus, cute names for new cocktails we make or even suggestions for playlists that fit the vibe we want in the restaurant that day. The restaurant also uses AI for their answering machine. There is an AI setup that will make reservations for guests if we do not get to the phone in time.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI in some pretty creative and customer-facing ways that I wouldn't have immediately thought of for restaurant work.

Tell me more about the process of creating those meal and drink descriptions. How do you typically work with AI on that?

User: Typically I give the AI bot the ingredients, flavours, or dish name and then ask them to create a "mouth watering" description. Sometimes we even just give them the ingredients and flavours and ask for help in coming up with the name of a new dish as well.

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative process. When you're working on these descriptions and names with AI, do you usually take what it gives you as-is, or do you find yourself tweaking and adjusting the suggestions it provides?

User: Typically tweaking and adjusting a few times until its prefect.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your restaurant work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer handling all of the customer facing roles myself. I know that there are probably AI bots that could take the customers orders and handle payments, but that is the part of my job that I enjoy. I like talking to strangers and building that connection with my customers even if just for an hour or two.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making there. It sounds like the human connection aspect is something you value keeping for yourself.

When you do use AI for those creative tasks like menu descriptions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it the task and let it work independently before you review?

User: No, it's very collaborative. I go back and worth adjusting the descriptions they've provided or changing the instructions I gave them until they create something that matches what I was envisioning in my head.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at the restaurant using it similarly, or did you kind of pioneer this approach?

User: I definitely began this appraoch but now we all kind of do it as a team. We find it like a fun game to talk to the AI and get the perfect descriptions/names, better than anything we could create on our own.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes it can be frustrating because I live in Canada so even after telling the AI bot that, it does not always use the correct spelling, grammar, or slang in its responses.

AI: That's a really specific frustration - having to constantly correct for the Canadian context even when you've specified it. 

Can you think of a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying? Maybe when you got exactly what you were looking for or it helped you accomplish something you were really pleased with?

User: I'm normally very satisfied with the cocktail names it comes up with! I find that the AI bots are very good at providing creative names for things, and I do not have to go back and forth with the model as much as I do with the descriptions.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't really think about this in my job. Being a waitress is something that an AI bot could never fully do as it cannot bring out the food, pour draft beers, or make cocktails. So I know that those skills will remain no matter what else AI takes over.

AI: That's a really secure perspective. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it in new ways, or are you pretty satisfied with how you're incorporating it now?

User: I'm pretty satisfied right now. The only other way I could see us using it would be to create full on menus or new recipes for us in the future. However, the chef we have now is incredibly creativie and loves to do that all on her own, so I can't see us using AI for her role unless she wants us to.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found this sweet spot between using AI for creative support while keeping the human connection parts of your job firmly in your own hands.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can enhance creative work in the restaurant industry while preserving the essential human elements of hospitality will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you and your team have turned working with AI into a collaborative, even playful process. Thanks again!
