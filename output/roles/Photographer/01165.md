Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work as a freelance photographer, photo editor, and graphic designer. I probably use AI most when I am editing. Because I am freelance I don't have "typical" projects, they are all fairly different.

AI: That's really interesting - having such variety in your projects as a freelancer must keep things dynamic. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I often use the AI tools that are built into Photoshop when I am editing photos. One of my clients is a clothing company, and they often ask for me to do edits like changing the color of something, adding details, or switching fabrics, and this is where I use AI to make that process faster. I also often use it when I want to change the background of an image, either swapping it out for a completely different background or removing unwanted items from an image.

AI: That sounds like AI is really helping streamline some of those more technical editing tasks for your clothing client. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently I was editing a picture for a client where they wanted me to add red bias tape to the back slit of a dress along with an embroidered heart. If I had to do this "by hand" it would have taken me a couple of hours, searching for images of the things that needed to be added and making them fit into the existing image without looking like they were pasted on. I used Photoshop AI to generate the edits to the garment, and after some fiddling with my prompts I was finished with the edits in 15 minutes instead of hours. It is great to be able to deliver high quality images to a client without as much work.

AI: That's a dramatic time savings - from hours down to 15 minutes! That must have a real impact on your workflow and potentially your business.

When you're working with AI on edits like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am driving the creative decisions most of the time, especially working on generating specific items that a client has requested. If there is some wiggle room I will sometimes give the AI a little more of a vague prompt to see what it comes up with, but generally I need to be very specific with what the model gives me because the images represent real items that the client will be selling, so they need to accurately represent what is being sold so that the customers of the client know what they're getting.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the accuracy requirement for representing actual products really puts you firmly in the driver's seat creatively. It sounds like you have to be quite precise with your direction.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Like I said before, the biggest change is the time that it saves me. It takes much less time to produce a realistic and high-quality result than previously when I was pasting elements into the image and trying to make them match the colors, shadows, and sizing of the original image.

AI: The time savings clearly seems to be the major transformation for you. Beyond the efficiency gains, have you noticed any other changes - perhaps in the types of projects you take on, or how you approach problem-solving, or even in your creative confidence when clients make requests?

User: Not really. The projects I take on are pretty much the same, and I would not deliver an image I wasn't confident about before or after starting to use AI.

AI: That's helpful to know - it sounds like AI has enhanced your efficiency without fundamentally changing your standards or approach to your work.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Like many artists, I worry about the way that AI uses artist's original work to produce images. Also, just as a human living on earth I'm concerned about the amount of power Ai computing takes.

AI: Those are really important concerns that many creative professionals share - both the attribution and compensation issues around training data, and the broader environmental impact.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I expect that as AI models are trained on more content that they will be able to produce better image output. Currently I find that image models often struggle with very specific instructions, and, lets be honest, most of them are not very good at producing photo-realistic images as a whole. I would guess that as time goes on these elements will improve. As time saving as AI is now for me to use for edits, it does sometimes take quite a bit of fiddling with the prompt and generating multiple options before I get something that I can use, and even then I often find myself needing to edit the generated content to make it fully fit my needs. It would be nice if, for example, when I ask the AI model to generate a photography studio-style plain backdrop with a shadow of the subject laying to the left and down, the model were able to reliably do this.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - you're seeing both the potential and the current limitations quite clearly. It sounds like you envision AI becoming more of a precision tool that can execute your specific vision more reliably, rather than something that fundamentally changes your role.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated how you described maintaining creative control while leveraging AI for efficiency, and your balanced view of both the benefits and concerns around AI in photography and design.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thats all I have. Thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI serves as a precision efficiency tool while you maintain creative control, along with your concerns about training data and environmental impact, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
