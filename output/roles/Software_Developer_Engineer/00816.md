Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's go for it

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI in a number of ways at work. The main bit is for quick calculations - i work in biomedical design engineering, so most of my day is in cad software. I'll use AI to quickly work out spacing for holes, or working out even spacing got vents or similar. I'll additionally use it regularly for help with designs, the best position to place certain features or similar. Outside of the CAD use, I use it for drafting emails, help with pricing, general administration tasks as well as questions about general topics, such as how to access bios settings or such.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of tasks, from the technical engineering calculations to more general administrative work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I'll generally not use AI for bits I know it will make errors in. If I ask it to make me a quick python script to automate a task, while it will generally work well I know it will struggle with other parts, such as modifying previously coded scripts. As AI improves i find myself having this issue less often, increasing my use of it, but for now i do avoid it when i think there'll be errors. I'll also do certain tasks it can help with myself if it's something I enjoy and I'm in the mood, such as calculations just to keep myself sharp.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - it sounds like you're making deliberate choices about when to rely on AI versus when to maintain your own skills.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: There's few tasks I find it can complete entirely itself, I use it as and when needed. Although I do have certain chats with long histories that are used for the same thing over and over. For example screw hole spacing, I have a chat with enough history that I can just type "d11, x14, w110" and it will give me the answer i need with no more context or words.

AI: That's fascinating - you've essentially developed a shorthand communication system with AI for recurring tasks. It sounds like you've found a really efficient workflow for those repetitive calculations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not at all, they're not overly experienced with AI, as i work with mostly older people less used to technology. I suppose the workplace has influenced it somewhat in expecting the impossible from me in terms of calculations in a certain time frame, which means I now default to ai when I need something worked out yesterday.

AI: So it sounds like you've become the go-to person for quick calculations because of the time pressures, and AI has become your way of meeting those demanding expectations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: We use sketchup regularly in work, and I had AI create a plugin that saved me a good 10 minutes every hour. That was extremely satisfying. On the flip side I first tried creating that same plugin in a different AI, and it kept giving me code that would crash the software. It would then say "Ah yes i know the problem, here's a guaranteed fix for that..." which would of course not fix the issue. That was very frustrating.

AI: That contrast is really striking - the satisfaction of getting that 10-minute-per-hour time saver working, but also the frustration of dealing with an AI that kept confidently offering "guaranteed fixes" that didn't work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't see much point - if I'm certain AI will be the standard in that task soon, I don't see the point in practicing it. Much like in the early days of photoshop you'd practice removing artefacts regularly, while now it's done with the click of a button - people don't even learn the old way of doing it as it's redundant. I consider it in a sense of "I spent all this time learning it for nothing", but not in a "I should keep this up just in case"

AI: That's a pragmatic perspective - treating skill development like any other technology transition where the old methods become obsolete.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Only increasing. As it improves, my use of it will increase, hopefully being implemented into the software I use.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed that shorthand communication system for recurring calculations, and your pragmatic approach to skill maintenance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing efficient workflows with AI, dealing with workplace time pressures, and your practical approach to technology transitions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
