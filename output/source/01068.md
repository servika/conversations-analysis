Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: i don't use ai very often for my work. my job is in the cleaning industry so i do a lot of manual labour, but i recently started a "mobile support" role where i cover cleaners when theyre off sick, but my boss also wants me to do more of the admin stuff too (essentially so that i can gradually train to become a manager). some of the admin involves writing reports or coming up with solutions to problems, so i might use ai to help me write stuff in a clear and concise way - i have a tendency to ramble and include unnecessary information, and it can help with things like spellchecking. and then i also might use it sometimes to write emails or generate a script for me to reference in a phone call i need to make, because ive never had a professional job before where those things were involved, so it can guide me in my mannerisms and what not. none of my actual work depends on ai, and to be honest i could easily do my job without it, but i like to use it when my brain is a bit fried and i want the job done quickly yet correctly. it's really only in admin situation and for writing tasks

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI more as a writing assistant and professional communication guide as you transition into these new administrative responsibilities.

You mentioned using it when your brain is "a bit fried" and you want the job done quickly yet correctly. Can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? What's happening in those moments when you decide to turn to AI for help?

User: maybe ive visited a site and done an audit, talked to the cleaner and discovered some issues. while i was on site i made notes about what he was struggling with that needed passing on to higher-ups. my notes are all scrambled and i've been out all day, so when i get home i just want to get the notes into a readable format that's clear for everyone involved. i might just type all of my notes up into an llm and have it collate and rewrite the notes in a productive way to save me from doing it myself. i'm usually not particularly stressed or anything, but when i get home i want to just chill out and want my work day to be over so the quicker i can get the report sent out, the better

AI: That paints a clear picture - you're essentially using it to transform your rough field notes into polished, professional reports when you're ready to wrap up your day.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned there are tasks you could easily do without it. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: i think im quite good at formatting the reports and writing them in a style that sounds like my own voice. im neurodivergent so i know how to make things accessible to absolutely anyone. so when it comes to slightly more creative tasks i prefer to do those myself, especially if it means i get recognition for something i know im good at - i dont think ai can replace that aspect of humanity. like i said, most of my job is manual labour, so ai can't help me with that, i really only use it for admin things when i can't be bothered to do it myself, but if it requires a personal touch i might do it myself instead, even if using ai would be quicker

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - the personal touch and getting recognition for your unique strengths, especially your ability to make things accessible to everyone. That sounds like something you genuinely value about your own contributions.

When you do use AI for those admin tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it your scrambled notes and let it handle the whole rewrite independently?

User: i'll usually just write a single prompt with an instruction, followed by my scrambled notes. a lot of the time i can just copy and paste what the ai gave me, and then maybe tweak it a bit when it's clear that ai wrote it for me (i think it looks unprofessional when its obviously not written by a human). sometimes i'll write one or two follow up points, just asking it to change something or include something it missed, but most of the time i can get the job done in one simple prompt and it just handles it all for me

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned tweaking it when it's clear AI wrote it because that looks unprofessional. Can you tell me more about that? What are the telltale signs that make it obvious it came from AI, and how do you go about making it sound more like your own voice?

User: honestly most people aren't super highly educated enough to understand linguistics or grammar - i studied it myself so i'm quite confident at it, but i'm generally quite lazy so will take shortcuts, and i think a lot of people do the same. so things like em dashes come up a lot in ai responses. if you were typing a document in microsoft word and used a hyphen, in certain situations it would convert to an em dash when you press space or enter, but most people are typing directly into an email or going into a sentence and adding a hyphen later, etc. so it wouldn't necessarily come up as an em dash. most people dont even know what an em dash is. so when they start cropping up its like "how much of this work actually belongs to the person who provided it?" other things like starting the sentence/paragraph with a sentence that just didn't need to be there. for example, you keep saying "that's interesting" or "that's [...]" and like, i don't know if your instructions told you to do that but its similar for other ai's where you'll ask it to generate a paragraph for example, and it will start with a sentence to set up the paragraph, to lead you in, and then everything else it says feels like it's telling a story, which isn't a bad thing but no human actually talks like that. it's really hard to explain but once you see it you can't unsee it, and it sucks to take credit for something you didn't even do. so often i'll take what the ai wrote, remove any filler, change any words i wouldn't naturally use in my own speech, and heck, maybe even add in a grammatical error just so that my colleagues know i'm human and we all make mistakes. it's dangerous territory to try and appear perfect all the time because people start expecting certain standards from you, or start to look at themselves and think they're not good enough, and before we know it everyone resorts to using ai for literally everything, and we lose that human touch that i talked about

AI: That's a fascinating breakdown - you really have developed an eye for AI's linguistic fingerprints. And I appreciate that deeper point about maintaining authenticity and not setting unrealistic standards for your colleagues.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it more of a personal choice you keep to yourself?

User: not at all. it's never been brought up, i don't even know if my colleagues are even "in the loop" with ai. i'm not ashamed of talking about it with anyone, but i don't think i'd bother to bring it up in conversation myself because it's just not relevant. i only really use it for myself because i'm lazy, and obviously i don't want my colleagues to know that

AI: That makes sense - it's more of a personal productivity tool for you rather than something that comes up in workplace conversations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: i can't think of a time when that happened as it pertains to my work. like i said, my job is very straightforward admin tasks, mostly manual labour, so i've never had a situation where ai caused me any problems or when it did a job for me that i couldn't do myself

AI: Got it - it sounds like your use of AI is pretty straightforward and low-stakes, which makes sense given how you've described it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: i'm doing a computing and it degree through the open university - i hope to learn more about ai in the final year of my degree but i do try and keep up to date with what's going on, including training ai models myself, so i have some room to adapt if things started changing and ai took over. i'd have some extra knowledge over my colleagues. but i don't really think about it too much, because until physical robots really take hold, i don't think ai on its own is going to make me lose my job, for example

AI: That's a really practical perspective - staying informed and building your knowledge while recognizing the current limitations of AI in your field.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as you continue developing these administrative and management skills?

User: i really don't think it's going to change for a while. until i start growing in my role, i don't really feel the need to use ai for much. if i started taking on a lot more admin tasks, and did some managing or training or the likes, then i'd probably use it more, and for different things, like more creative tasks and generating plans and rotas and stuff. i think in those types of situations it would save me a lot of time and mental energy, and maybe give me ideas that i might not have come up with myself, given my low-level professional background. but it feels like a "way off into the future" kind of thing

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that human authenticity in your writing and being mindful of not setting unrealistic standards for your colleagues.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear about how AI fits into your work in such a practical, measured way - especially as you're navigating this transition into more administrative responsibilities. Your perspective on keeping things authentic while still benefiting from AI's efficiency is something I think many people can relate to.

I hope the rest of your degree goes well, and thanks again for participating in this research!
