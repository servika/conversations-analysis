Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, I'm a book cover design and illustration. So I use AI models to generate thumbnails in the ideation process. I also do some marketing content, so I use the models to create some copy.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI for both the visual ideation and the written content side of your work. 

When you say you use AI models to generate thumbnails in your ideation process, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does that fit into your overall design workflow?

User: When I'm given a project, I need to come up with 4-6 ideas for a client. Sometimes, it's not easy to come up with ideas for projects that are more abstract. So I use a few key words such as "wind" "retro" "fashion" "abstract poster" to see what an AI comes up with. It's a pretty fluid process. I'm just looking for something that looks interesting.

AI: That sounds like a really fluid, exploratory process. When you find something that looks interesting from those AI-generated thumbnails, what happens next? Do you use that as a jumping-off point for your own work, or does it influence your process in a different way?

User: I usually use it as jumping-off point for my actual thumbnails. I take the ideas into Photoshop and look to generate designs similar to it. Or use the clone stamp tool to copy them.  Sometimes, I feed the AI its own generated image and ask me to create variations of it, in different colors or adding some noise or borders or stuff like that.

AI: So you're really using it as both initial inspiration and then as a tool for iteration and refinement. That's an interesting back-and-forth process.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of your design work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The AI is not very good, at the moment, at following precise instructions. For example if I want a characters hand to have a certain number of wrist bands, it cannot follow the instructions. So for stuff like that I don't use the AI. Also, if its sequential art, AI isn't great at maintaining character consistency, so I don't rely on it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those precision and consistency requirements seem like natural boundaries for where you draw the line.

When you are using AI for the tasks it handles well, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth collaboration with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it something to work on and let it handle that piece independently?

User: It's usually a back-and-forth collaboration. I go through many iterations asking for it to change this or that or add a certain style. Sometimes it fails to do it. In that case, I start a new conversation and try again. Or I upload the images it generated to a copy different model and see what it comes up with.

AI: That iterative approach sounds quite dynamic - bouncing between different models when one isn't giving you what you need. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing these tools with other designers, or is it more of an individual exploration?

User: None of the people I know use AI for designing. Maybe there's a reluctance to use new technology or they don't quite understand how to use it. I don't usually discuss it with people since art community seem to look down upon it at the moment.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - being somewhat on your own in exploring these tools while sensing that broader resistance in the art community.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was trying to create a sequence of hedgehog images.  In various poses, from a side view. I really struggled to get the AI to only return the sideview perspective. It kept giving me different perspectives, like front, three-quarters. It was as if it didn't understand what I was telling it to do. I eventually gave up.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you had such a clear, specific vision of what you needed. The AI just couldn't seem to grasp that constraint about maintaining the side view perspective.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think the ability to use AI is a skill. That's probably where the industry is heading. Someone needs to be able to tell the AI to create things and it's not as easy as just typing a prompt and expecting a perfect reply. I feel prompt engineering is going to be integrated into every career. I don't think artists are going to be replaced but I feel companies will look for artists who can collaborate efficiently with an AI. So I keep myself updated on how people construct prompts.

AI: That's such a thoughtful perspective - viewing AI collaboration as a skill to develop rather than a threat to resist. It sounds like you're actively positioning yourself for that future.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally?

User: I expect to use it about the same way as I am currently, until there's a major upgrade that makes it easier to develop sequential art consistently. Then, I'm likely to branch out and create my own content - storybooks, videos and perhaps try to create another income stream that way

AI: That's exciting - the idea of AI improvements potentially opening up entirely new creative avenues for you, like storybooks and videos. It sounds like you're really thinking strategically about how these tools might expand your possibilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on prompt engineering as an emerging skill and how you're navigating being somewhat alone in exploring these tools in your field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in the creative process - from that fluid ideation phase to the iterative collaboration, and especially your thoughts on how the industry might evolve - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
