Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently worked on a project developing a new yeast display system for creating antibody fragments against known cancer markers. It began with the desire to move from phage display and bacterial protein production into a eukaryotic expression system to avoid some issues we were having with protein yields and post translational modifications. We eventually settled on a method that would allow for continuous evolution in a yeast model and provide greater yields.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - moving from phage display to a yeast system to address those protein production challenges. 

Can you tell me more about what that process looked like as you moved from that initial desire to solve the protein yield issues all the way through to your final yeast display method? What were the key steps or phases you went through?

User: The first step was identifying the problem. Our main issue was that the bacterial expression system we were using was not compatible with certain structural aspects of our antibody fragments. This led us to the idea of using a eukaryotic model instead. At the same time we were having bottleneck issues due to the amount of time and effort using phage to evolve the fragments required. Moving to a continuous display system would solve this problem and using a continuous yeast display system solved both problems. We then had to decide how to put the system together. Once a framework for the display system was devised we had to figure out how to transform the yeast with the required genes. This also allowed us to test our expression system in the yeast and increase our overall yields while we were still figuring out the full display system. Once the yeast could be efficiently transformed, we began producing our antibody fragments in them and then started the separate process of getting all of the pieces of the display system into the yeast. Once the display system was integrated into our yeast strain, we had an efficient system of evolving our antibody fragments for new targets and producing large quantities of them for further studies.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview - it sounds like you had multiple interconnected challenges to solve, from the structural compatibility issues to the bottleneck problems with phage display. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We mostly used it for small things such as figuring out timing of experiments to maximize efficiency, identifying any stubborn issues that arose, organizing data. The most step where AI was most helpful was during literature review when designing the new display system and figuring out culture conditions for the yeast.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI was particularly valuable during the design and troubleshooting phases. 

Can you tell me more about how you used AI for the literature review when you were designing the display system? What did that process look like?

User: We had a general idea of how we wanted the display system to run so it mostly just consisted of using AI to check if our idea was in use already and to curate research papers about the individual components we brought together to form our platform.

AI: So it sounds like AI helped you both verify the novelty of your approach and gather relevant research on the component pieces. 

For that literature curation work, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach to reviewing papers?

User: It wasn't an overly large debate. Using AI seemed like the most efficient way to gather data during the planning stage and we were satisfied with the results.

AI: That makes sense - efficiency was a key factor. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the actual experimental work, transforming the yeast, or testing the expression system - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: We used AI to help troubleshoot any persistent issues that we had trouble figuring out but other than that there wasn't really any situation where we felt AI was necessary since we were performing relatively standard tests.

AI: So it sounds like you saw AI as most useful for the non-routine parts - the literature work and troubleshooting when standard approaches weren't working.

When you did use AI for troubleshooting those persistent issues, how did you verify or validate the suggestions it gave you?

User: For the most part AI was just able to give us ideas about something we hadn't considered yet and either we realized it was correct after reading its suggestions, or our PI verified them as potential solutions and we tested them.

AI: That's helpful - so AI was more of an idea generator to broaden your thinking, and then you'd evaluate those suggestions through your own expertise or with your PI before testing.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love to have a synergistic display platform that uses both directed evolution and in silico mutagenesis to improve the scale of our libraries and screening capabilities.

AI: That sounds like a really powerful combination - merging the directed evolution you're already doing with computational mutagenesis to scale up your libraries and screening. 

What would make that particularly valuable compared to your current approach? What limitations are you hitting now that this hybrid system would solve?

User: By increasing our screening capacity it would just augment the speed and breadth of the research we're already doing. When every step is being done by hand even with continuous evolution, there is a limit to our efficiency that computational methods drastically outstrip.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - even with the continuous evolution system you developed, you're still hitting manual throughput limits that computational approaches could help overcome.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as an efficiency tool for literature review and troubleshooting, while keeping the hands-on experimental work traditional, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI serves as an idea generator and efficiency booster in the planning phases, while the experimental work remains hands-on, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The vision you described for combining directed evolution with computational mutagenesis also gives us valuable perspective on where you see the biggest opportunities ahead.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
