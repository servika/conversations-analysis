Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I've predominantly been using it to guide me through the use of certain types of software, such as Microsoft Word, Adobe Acrobat, Photoshop, and Canva. It has also been useful to act as a "second pair of eyes" when proofreading texts to make sure I've not missed any glaringly obvious mistakes in spelling, typos, grammar issues, etc.

AI: That's really helpful to hear about those specific use cases. When you say AI guides you through software like Word or Photoshop, can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? How do those interactions typically unfold?

User: Usually I'll have a specific goal in mind, such as changing the line spacing in a Word doc, or removing the smudging on a hand-drawn document that has been scanned onto my PC which I'm "digitalizing" to bring it up to a professional/publishable standard. Since I've had to learn these different types of software as I go, AI has sped up the process by helping me to find relevant menus, settings, etc. inside these programs' interfaces. However, sometimes I might just present the end result that I want, and ask the AI for advice on how best to achieve the goal, either within software I'm already using or I'll ask it to recommend the best tool for the job.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - sometimes asking for help navigating tools you're already in, and other times asking for broader strategic advice about which tool to use. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Sometimes, as a matter of personal principle, I will avoid using AI when it comes to the more creative aspects of my work, partly out of a sense that it seems downright lazy to go straight to AI to fix everything, without having to first think for myself. But, also because I value human creativity above AI "creativity". For example, if I'm making design choices about formatting a text, or creating a figure, diagram, map or schematic, I will first do a deep dive into the problem without AI assistance. This is because I do not want the AI to rob me of my own spontaneous creative input. I treat asking other humans for advice in the same way. First of all it's important to splurge my own creative ideas down onto page before I get any outside input. Then comes the collaborative stage, which can involve asking multiple generative AI chatbots for their input, as well as other humans I can go to for advice.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - protecting that initial creative space before bringing in outside input, whether from AI or humans. It sounds like you've developed a pretty deliberate process around this.

When you do move into that collaborative stage you mentioned, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with AI throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I've very rarely delegated complete tasks to AI, as I don't want to give it that level of control. As far as I'm concerned, I am in charge, and I want it to stay that way. So it is more of a collaborative process where the AI acts as a sort of co-pilot, but I am still the captain of the ship! The interaction pattern is really simple, I just present some problem or goal, say and/or demonstrate what work I have done so far, and either ask for an opinion, or if I'm very stuck, for a solution to a specific problem.

AI: I really like that captain and co-pilot analogy - that paints a clear picture of how you maintain control while still getting value from the collaboration.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work mostly alone, and many of my clients are elderly and probably don't use AI that much (if at all), so there's no influence there. I collaborate a little with the publishers of the texts that I work on, but I'm not aware of their AI practices, although I'm sure they will probably have started to integrate AI into their workflows already as well.

AI: That makes sense - working mostly independently gives you a lot of freedom to develop your own approach without external pressures or expectations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I first started using tools like Photoshop, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. AI was a saviour for me here because it meant I didn't have to spend hours trawling tediously through documentation or online guides that were not "intelligent" like an AI chatbot is. The great thing about these generative AI chatbots is that they can give you a quick guide that is specifically tailored to your needs! This is very satisfying, as it cuts down on wasted time.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can really accelerate learning in a targeted way. The tailored guidance sounds like it was exactly what you needed at that moment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it's just a reality we all should face at this stage: that in the future certain tasks will be completed much faster and with fewer mistakes than a human or team of humans could realistically achieve. That doesn't mean we should stop doing these tasks if they're enjoyable to us. But in the world of work where the financial bottom line is the number one priority, AI will be playing a more and more significant role. I actually relish the idea of AI taking over the boring tasks! As long as humans retain the power to make executive decisions, and the AI serves us and not the other way around, I'm happy.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - embracing AI for the mundane tasks while keeping humans in the decision-making role. It sounds like you see it as potentially freeing up space for more meaningful work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm already looking at the potential of delegating more tasks to AI agents, at work and in hobby projects. It's a fascinating area and I'm excited by the possibilities. I'm still learning the plethora of ways AI can be used to our benefit, but especially need AI models that can hold a larger amount of context in their "memory" while responding to certain requests.

AI: That progression from co-pilot to potentially delegating more to AI agents is really interesting - it sounds like your comfort level and trust are growing as you see what works well.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on protecting that initial creative space before collaborating, and your captain-and-co-pilot approach to maintaining control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, and I must go now! Thanks and goodbye :-)

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as a learning accelerator will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
