Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That works with me! I don't have any questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by hearing about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Sure! I do a lot of work regarding statistical analysis for biological datasets on campus. I'm specifically tailored towards doing work in biostatistics, using R as my programming language. One relatively recent example of work I've done was collaborating with a professor who collected data on diet composition of two species of fish belonging to the Acropoma genus. He believed that the data could potentially show a pattern of diet partitioning, showing that these two fish switch diets depending on the months of the year, which was a super interesting project. And so another professor and I took a look at the dataset, cleaned it, and performed a suite of analysis to show that there were indeed significant differences between their diets using months as a main explanatory variable. We wrote up a results section and that manuscript is currently under review.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - the idea of seasonal diet partitioning in fish is really compelling! I can imagine there were quite a few steps involved in getting from that raw dataset to a manuscript under review.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Specifically when it comes to writing code or figuring out what kinds of analysis might be appropriate considering the question we want to ask. It's very helpful when there's a transformation or function I want to apply to the dataset that I know what should happen, but I don't have the specific code lines to perform it. AI has been super helpful in this aspect. Also, I like to ask it for ideas regarding if the analysis we've done was compelling enough or if there is additional tests we can perform to strengthen our results.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those coding and analysis suggestion tasks.

User: I really chose it as a supplemental tool rather than a main driver of my work. I could find the correct functions and code using a traditional approach of online research, but AI efficiency when it comes to these tasks are much faster. And a similar thing happens with the analysis, I only use it as a supplemental tool for additional ideas and such. To me, the choice to use AI ultimately came down to speed and it being a good option to brainstorm ideas and check work I've already done. I don't want to completely rely on AI to do all my tasks though, as there is merit in understanding the output of AI (for example, I don't just blindly insert code into my scripts without understanding it). But overall, its a great tool.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using it as a supplement for efficiency while still maintaining your understanding of the work. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I haven't really used AI to write manuscripts or to perform things (such as analysis or writing) on it's own. I much prefer to do things myself and use AI to double check my work. While I'm sure it's ability to analyze and write is getting much better, I think it's important for me to have those skills on my own, so I leave the bulk of the work to myself rather than relying on work from AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining and developing your own core skills while leveraging AI strategically. 

When you've used AI for coding and analysis suggestions, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: Well for code, I have understanding of basic functions and syntax, so I can validate that just by working through the logic of the code, looking up online resources if the code that is produced does something I don't understand. A part of that is also being able to ask the model for an explanation of the code, which I've found to be very helpful too. For analysis, I have a good general knowledge regarding what different types of tests do, so the ones the model might suggest I can validate using my own knowledge (like if that test makes sense given the dataset). But once again if I don't understand something, I can look online or just ask the model to explain further.

AI: That validation process sounds really solid - you're using multiple layers of checking. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I think something that could be really interesting would be figure generation. Obviously creating figures takes time, but it would be really helpful if the models could fine tune figures I give it with prompts such as "make the text in this figure more simplistic or use a different font". Or "scale the x-axis to ___". Prompts like these where the model could give me an updated version of my figure would be awesome to have.

AI: That's a really specific and practical need - having AI handle those detailed figure refinements would definitely save a lot of time with the back-and-forth tweaking that figures often require.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a strategic supplement while maintaining your core analytical skills were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: That is all, thanks.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an efficiency tool while maintaining your own understanding of the work really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific workflows. The way you described your validation process - checking code logic, leveraging your knowledge of statistical tests, and asking for explanations when needed - shows a really thoughtful approach to AI integration.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
