Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an online ESL (English to Speakers of other Languages) tutor and I teach 25 min - 50 min classes to young Chinese students. After each class, I write a class report to be sent to the student and their parents. The teaching platform of the company I work for has an AI assistant that writes a transcript for each class and then writes a summary of the class. It was suggested to the teachers to use this AI written summary as a basis for a class report, by entering the summary into ChatGPT along with a prompt which outlines the different sections of the class report (Main Idea, Main objectives of the class, Key words and lesson report). The prompt explains how each section should be filled in, and gives specific guidelines for the lesson report section which is a one or two paragraph long summary of what was studied in the class plus the areas the student is doing well in and the areas the student needs to work on. Personally, I used this system for a while when doing my class reports, but found the lesson report sections were not personal enough and the key word lists were not specific enough. I now use AI to write a list of keywords for each class. The AI gives me the Chinese translation, then the definition and an example sentence. I then use this list as part of the lesson report which I finish writing myself. Occasionally, I ask the AI to use the list of words to create an activity or homework sheet, often without much success. I also ask for help with explaining grammar in Chinese for my students, and sometimes I ask it to explain difficult grammar points to me so that I can teach more confidently. I have also asked for advice on teaching methods.

AI: That's a really detailed picture of how you've adapted AI to fit your teaching workflow. It sounds like you've experimented quite a bit and found what works best for you and your students.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that you moved away from having AI write the full lesson reports because they weren't personal enough. Are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks feel like they should stay in your hands?

User: It is mainly the lesson reports that I feel are most important to be written personally by myself. In this way, I can write in a way that is specific to each student, and that is personal and honest rather than generic. I feel it helps to foster a stronger bond with my students. One other area is that I prefer giving a specific list of the vocabulary that we studied in that class to the AI, rather than letting the it pick out random words from the AI written summary as our company suggested. Giving the list of the most important key words from that class means the lesson report is highly specific and tailored to that class, and can be of most benefit to my students. Before hand, the AI was just picking out a few words from the summary and was missing many important key words. In this way, I can collaborate with the AI by giving it the words I want listed, but then allowing it to write out the translation, definition and example. It saves me a huge amount of time and the AI does a great job of it!

AI: That's fascinating how you've found that sweet spot between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining the personal touch that matters most to your students and their parents.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you've developed a pretty collaborative approach - especially with the vocabulary lists where you provide the specific words and let AI handle the translations and examples. Is this back-and-forth collaboration typical of how you work with AI, or are there times when you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I have a long running conversation with ChatGPT that I come back to every working day to write my reports with. I initially asked it 'please give me kid friendly definitions for.....', and it gave me a pretty good list with definitions. Over time, we refined the system together, adding in the Chinese translation, the example sentence, and recently whether the words is verb/ adjective etc. Now when I'm writing my class reports, I just start with 'and for (list of key words)' and it gives me the list in the same format. Occasionally, I'll then as it to go deeper into a grammar point in a way the student can understand (it generally uses a mix of Chinese and English for this). There aren't really any times where I delegate a complete task for it to handle independently, although I do trust it to do a good job on the vocabulary list so I just briefly check the definitions and Chinese translations are correct before adding it into the report and completing the other parts myself.

AI: That's a really interesting example of how you've built up this ongoing working relationship with AI over time. It sounds like you've trained it to understand exactly what you need, and now you have this efficient shorthand where you can just say "and for..." and it knows the format.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned that your company initially suggested using the AI summary directly in ChatGPT - how has that shaped or affected the way you've developed your own approach?

User: Our workplace has enthusiastically integrated AI into several areas of our online system, and they actively encourage us to use AI for these reports to save time. We even had an hour long training specifically on how to use AI to write our reports where they gave us a detailed lesson report prompt that had been written by a member of staff. This meeting influenced me to at first use that system, but I ended up finding the way that worked best for me. I'm not really sure how it's going for my colleagues, as we don't get to meet in person. The meeting and encouragement from the company really shaped my approach, as I don't think I would have started using AI for those tasks at all without that push.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like your company's encouragement was the catalyst that got you started, even though you eventually developed your own approach that works better for your specific needs.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've felt a bit frustrated at times when the AI has offered to make an activity or exercise for students, but then gives me something that isn't very coherent. It did manage to make a pretty successful activity for my today though! It was the first time I could actually use an AI activity in class, so I was satisfied by that!

AI: That's great that you finally had a breakthrough with the AI-generated activity working in class today! It sounds like that was a long time coming after multiple attempts that didn't quite work out.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I suppose maintaining my skills in areas where AI might take over, like writing, is another part of why I like to write the detailed lesson report section myself. When I was using the original prompt which had the AI write the whole report from the summary, I stared to feel like I was forgetting how to write those paragraphs for myself! It did make me think about how I don't want to lose my writing and communication skills. On the other hand, it has been a fantastic tool for growing my skills in applying my Chinese language knowledge better in class (AI can explain how a word is used really well, and can pretty much always find the right word to use in a particular context, whereas dictionaries may have many different words and can be more ambiguous.) It has also helped me to deepen my understanding of English grammar, further developing my teaching skills.

AI: That's a really thoughtful balance you've struck - using AI to enhance and deepen your expertise while being intentional about not letting it replace core skills like your writing and communication abilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision that my relationship with AI may become even more beneficial and time saving, due to the fact that it may now be possible to get downloadable activities and exercises to give my students. I'm sure it may evolve in other ways, too, especially as the company I work for is quite innovative when it comes to AI integration!

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found that balance between leveraging AI's efficiency while maintaining the personal touch that strengthens your relationships with students and parents - and how you've been so intentional about preserving your own writing skills while using AI to enhance your teaching expertise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've evolved from using the company's suggested approach to developing your own collaborative method with AI - especially that ongoing conversation format you've created - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've navigated maintaining your personal touch and professional skills while still embracing AI's capabilities where they truly add value. Thanks again!
