Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, let's go

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in healthcare as a nurse. I've used AI to help write better nursing notes. AI has been really useful for looking things up like medications, procedures, and lesser known disorders. It gives me the chance to ask follow up questions that traditional internet searches don't.

AI: That's really interesting - the follow-up aspect sounds quite valuable. Can you tell me more about how those follow-up questions work for you? What kinds of things do you find yourself asking that you couldn't easily search for before?

User: A lot of medical information available to the public is generalized. AI lets me follow up with specifics like gender, weight, age, race when asking about symptoms or medication side effects. Sometimes when AI asks follow-up questions or gives suggestions at the end of its answers, it will suggest stuff that's related to what I was asking that I never would have thought of but is a good idea.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI helps you think through cases more thoroughly. You mentioned using it for nursing notes and looking up medical information. Are there certain tasks in your nursing work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I think AI is really helpful with brainstorming, helping to steer things in certain directions, and just generally being a sounding board but I like to make final decisions. I like writing my own nursing notes and care plans but it is really nice to get help with clarity, wording choice, and other types of suggestions

AI: That distinction between getting help versus making final decisions is really clear. When you're working with AI on something like nursing notes or care plans, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and then work with what it gives you?

User: Both. Sometimes I'll get help on short simple stuff like how else can i say 'still sleeping, no changes' during the nightshift? Using it almost like a thesaurus. Other times, I give it a list of basic details and ask it to turn it into a whole care plan. Then there's usually a back and forth of editing. I keep specifics like names out of it for privacy reasons and edit those in after on a secure charting app

AI: That privacy consideration is really thoughtful. I'm curious about your workplace - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you talked with other nurses about it, or is it something you've adopted more independently?

User: I don't talk about it at work. There's a lot of stigma around AI for various reasons. Even though, like I said, I don't get specific on the AI apps and only add private health information after I've copy/pasted everything into a secure app, I feel like someone would try to get me in trouble. Even when I'm just doing research like getting a step by step on a certain procedure that maybe I dont do a lot and just want a refresher, people are going to have something to say. Like I dont know what I'm doing or hoe dare I trust AI. I don't think it's any different than watching a youtube video and I've seen even doctors do that.

AI: That tension between finding AI helpful but feeling like you need to keep it private sounds really challenging. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It relates to what I was saying about follow-up questions with AI as opposed to a Google search. We had someone come in with a semi rare disorder. In 10 minutes I knew all about the disorder and its treatments. I knew that people from the patient's country of origin were more likely to have it and why. I also knew several new things about the patient's country of origin. I was learning medical facts, geography, world history. All these things that you wouldn't look up because you didnt know they were related. It's like learning in a web pattern

AI: That web pattern of learning sounds really powerful - discovering connections you wouldn't have thought to look for. You mentioned feeling like you need to keep your AI use private at work because of stigma. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially help? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm always open to any areas where AI can help. I would never turn down help that could save someones life because of gossip or social judgement. Right now, I think there are a lot more people than I know that are doing the same things I am. Maybe all my co workers and we just don't talk about it. Someone has to break the seal and no one wants to be the first. Most people will admit to using a Google search but not the AI feature. I think it's reasonable to not want people to let AI make their final decisons for them. "Double check your work before you do anything drastic just in case AI was wrong" sort of thing but, duh.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the idea that others might be doing the same thing but nobody's talking openly about it. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you?

User: I love the idea of AI doing all the paperwork so I can focus on on patient care. Without the stigma behind AI being a sort of form of cheating, I think everyone would agree that we need AI to do all the boring paperwork in every field. There's absolutely no logical reason behind forcing humans to fill out forms. I also hope in the future that we can trust AI to be accurate enough to be a sole source of information so that both serious and mundane questions can be answered quickly without having to take the time of "looking it up".

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you learn in that "web pattern" - discovering connections between medical facts, geography, and history that you wouldn't have thought to explore otherwise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research tool, the challenges of workplace stigma, and your vision for AI handling administrative tasks will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you're seeing and the social dynamics you're navigating. Take care!
