Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI multiple times throughout my work day, typically to assist in writing communications between myself and my clients or colleagues. I use it to rewrite emails and text messages. Occasionally, I consult with AI to discuss strategies relating to my work, such as what approach I should take in certain communications, or to help me organize my day

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using AI to rewrite your emails and messages, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you write a draft first and then ask for revisions, or do you start from scratch with AI?

User: Most often I write emails and messages and then copy and paste the draft to an AI for revisions. I may then do my own revisions to whatever the AI has revised. Very occasionally I will copy a message I received and ask an AI to draft a potential response where I would then edit myself. However, this would be in the minority of cases

AI: That gives me a clear picture of your process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: While I have used AI to help organize my work day and help me prioritize tasks, I often find it struggles to help with this, so I choose to do it myself

AI: Tell me more about that. What specifically does AI struggle with when it comes to organizing your day or prioritizing tasks?

User: I think when I ask AI to organize my day and prioritize tasks it struggles to really understand what's most important and doesn't know how to adequately incorporate things like breaks, even when I ask for it

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like AI misses some of the nuanced understanding you have about your own work priorities and personal needs. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate with it. Since it's most often used in my written communications, I often feel the need to ask it to be more friendly or personable or firm and then ultimately end up editing it a bit myself to make it sound less "AI" and more like me

AI: That's a really interesting collaboration dynamic. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues promote the use of AI for client communication. They have incorporated AI tools of their own to help us with this

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I find the use of dashes frustrating with AI. Also the types of subject lines it comes up with. To me, these are dead giveaways you're using AI verbatim and it comes off less authentic

AI: That's a really specific observation about the telltale signs of AI writing. It sounds like authenticity is important to you in your communications. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't really considered how I can maintain my skills. Especially as I've become more reliant on AI to assist with my writing. I think I've maintained some level of written communication skill by always trying to collaborate with AI rather than simply delegate my communication needs to it

AI: That's thoughtful - it sounds like your collaborative approach might be helping preserve those skills naturally. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can imagine the writing quality of AI becoming more authentic overtime and more humanlike overall. I could envision it doing a lot more of the administrative busy work for me or potentially draft paperwork I simply need to review

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you actively collaborate rather than just delegate to maintain authenticity and preserve your own skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach to AI writing, the importance of authenticity in communications, and those specific details about AI writing patterns will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
