Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: all good

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for image generation quite often in work, as well as (sometimes) calculating angles. I work making laser cut designs and woodwork, as well as converting campervans

AI: That's fascinating - I wouldn't have immediately thought of AI for laser cutting and campervan conversion work. 

Tell me more about how you use image generation in that context. What specific aspects of your laser cut designs or campervan projects does that help with?

User: Well I have been making campervans, but using a laser cutter to make borders and images on the woodwork means I can use cheaper wood but easily make it look good. So I ask AI models to create vector style images with transparent backgrounds so I can use them for laser burning. I can also take specific images and have them created in an etched style (like getting a landscape thats local to a client done)

AI: That's a clever approach - using AI to create custom vector graphics that enhance cheaper materials. The idea of creating personalized local landscapes for clients sounds particularly thoughtful.

When you're working on these designs, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI to refine the images, or do you typically get what you need in one go?

User: I rarely get what I want in one go

AI: What does that back-and-forth process typically look like for you? How do you work with the AI to get from that first attempt to something you can actually use for laser cutting?

User: I have found the best way is to be as specific as possible in the first round, because follow up rounds often change and the models find it hard to make minor alterations without changing too much. Sometimes I have to give up on an idea with one model and switch to another - I think this is because one model gets fixated on something and can't see outside it.

AI: That's a really interesting observation about models getting "fixated" and struggling with minor alterations. It sounds like you've developed some specific strategies for working around these limitations.

When you do have to switch models because one gets stuck, how do you approach that transition? Do you start completely fresh with the new model or try to build on what the previous one produced?

User: Oh that's a good question, I don't often take what one model produced and try work off it. I usually start with the exact same prompt as the first model I tried, but then maybe 50% of the time I make alterations to the prompt based on what went wrong on my first attempt.

AI: That makes sense - essentially learning from what didn't work with the first model to refine your approach. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your laser cutting or campervan work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Sometimes the models struggle to create a viable image that has a blank background. It's easier to just do this myself than ask the model (since there is a high risk of them changing the image too much removing the background).

AI: So there are some technical tasks where the risk of the AI changing too much actually makes it more efficient to just do it yourself. That's a practical trade-off.

Are there other aspects of your work - maybe in the design process or the actual woodworking - where you actively choose to keep AI out, even if it could theoretically help?

User: Specific things - I would love it if AI was better at calculating angles, or knowing the dimensions of vehicles so that it would be able to give the dimensions for cuts that I could send to a CNC machine or laser cutter. That mix of having strong information with the ability to generate a template with accurate dimensions would be incredible for my work.

AI: That sounds like it would be a game-changer - having AI that could combine accurate vehicle specifications with precise angle calculations and then output ready-to-cut templates. 

You mentioned you sometimes use AI for calculating angles now. How does that currently work for you, and what are the limitations you run into?

User: Vans are irregularly shaped and I try to ask the AI models sometimes how to calculate the angles based on dimensions I give, but they are not always accurate, maybe a 60% success rate

AI: A 60% success rate for angle calculations sounds frustrating when precision is critical for your cuts. 

When the AI gets those calculations wrong, how do you typically catch the error? Is it something you can spot before you make the cut, or do you sometimes discover it when the piece doesn't fit properly?

User: I generally don't trust models so I give the same prompt to multiple models. I will state - my measurements are accurate!

AI: Smart approach - using multiple models as a cross-check and being very explicit about your measurements being accurate. 

When you do get consensus among the models or when they do get it right, does that save you significant time compared to doing those angle calculations manually?

User: I'm incredibly illiterate mathematically, so my approach to campervan conversions is usually to make blanks and trace them, or anything other than doing calculations. So AI's, when accurate, save a lot of time for this.

AI: That makes perfect sense - so when the AI calculations work, they're replacing a much more time-consuming manual process of creating templates and tracing. That's a significant workflow improvement when it's accurate.

How have your colleagues or others in your field influenced the way you approach using AI in your work? Do you share techniques or learn from how others are using it?

User: It's a small team - just 3 of us and then we subcontract for more difficult/specialist stuff - we experimented with using it for helping understand electrics and wiring but it was still too confusing without the AI's being able to restrict their information to specific models of equipment (e.g., wiring a Renogy or Victron), and we agreed it was too high risk to trust the models on things like calculating changing wire sizes based on difference. But we all love image creation since none of us are artists, we're mostly wood workers. Sometimes we had hired designers which was crazy expensive for similar output. We share techniques that we used to get good results (e.g, we used as for images that appear etched because that replicates how lasers burn designs, but then we realized we can ask for vector images for clear backgrounds and shared that with each other). We don't really use AI for talking to customers because it's mostly phone calls and emails are easy to respond to without AI.

AI: It sounds like you've all developed a really practical approach - embracing AI where it clearly adds value like image creation, but staying away from high-risk areas like electrical calculations. The collaborative sharing of techniques like asking for "etched" style images is smart.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I wanted a minimalist image of the Stawamus Chief mountain in Squamish for a client and no matter what image I gave the model of the Chief, it would churn out non-representative images, or alter it so significantly that it didn't resemble the original at all. Any time I asked for changes they were so dramatically altered that I had to give up and hire a designer.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you had a clear reference image but the AI kept producing something completely different from this recognizable local landmark. And then having to go back to hiring a designer defeats the whole purpose of using AI to avoid those costs.

When situations like that happen, do you find yourself losing confidence in using AI for other image tasks, or are you able to compartmentalize it as just certain types of requests that don't work well?

User: Oh I definitely lose confidence. It feels like a sunk cost exercise. I feel like in future AI will be able to complete these tasks with less bad results, but often it seems like now isn't the right time for image alterations

AI: That feeling of it being a "sunk cost exercise" really captures the frustration - you've invested time and effort but can't use the results. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? For instance, with image creation being such a big part of what you use AI for now, is this something you actively consider?

User: Well I can't create images myself anyway, so I need AI for this.

AI: That's a fair point - AI is filling a gap in skills you never had rather than replacing existing ones.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Are there particular improvements or capabilities you're hoping to see that would change how you use it?

User: I want to see image consistency, and for the AI to know specifics about specific vehicle models and for them to be able to give me schematics and designs that I can download from the AI and upload into other programmes to be made (e.g, on a laser cutter, 3D printer, etc)

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed workarounds for AI's limitations - like using multiple models to cross-check calculations and being very specific in your prompts because follow-up iterations tend to change too much.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I'm all good

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in such a specialized field - from the creative applications to the technical limitations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really interesting to learn about how you've adapted AI to work within the unique constraints of laser cutting and campervan conversion. Thanks again!
