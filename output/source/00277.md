Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here with Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: normally I use it as a better form of internet searching, things like figuring out the appropriate git commands to do things, deciding between SQL approaches, etc. I also use it to brainstorm wording for user-facing strings and sometimes internal documentation.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as both a technical reference and a writing partner. 

Tell me more about how you decide when to turn to AI versus other resources for those technical questions like git commands or SQL approaches.

User: for technical questions, if its something that I would google/web search to find the answer, i will just use AI instead. same thing with subjective things like SQL approaches. I rarely will use a normal web search these days unless its something really new that I'm not sure the AI tools will have info on (or if its something that is mission critical and needs to be 100% accurate like if a SQL version supports certain features or something)

Also any questions related to technical internal infrastructure or patterns are when I'll use our internal search engines and tools since AI wont know anything about that.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've developed a clear decision tree for when to use which resource. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: By far the most important task I like to do myself is write code. I enjoy the physical act of typing to write code and so I don't use things like copilot or other AI tools to write code. Exceptions are boilerplate situations, like if i have to make 10+ c# properties with the same structure but slightly different naming - but situations like this is actually pretty rare for my work. 

another task I like to do myself is writing technical documentation or internal communication/emails. I pride myself a little bit on my writing skills, and so I want to maintain those skills by avoiding using AI to generate drafts (but I have used AI as thesaurus sometimes).

a recent task I still did myself is creating a powerpoint presentation - I enjoy being a little creative with presentations, but that may change since making presentations takes a lot of time to do.

AI: I can really hear the personal connection you have to coding and writing - it sounds like there's both enjoyment and skill preservation at play there.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I think more of collaborating, like I'll ask for a SQL approach, and then follow up with modifications and such until I get the options I need.  Very rarely would I delegate a task to it.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds really engaged. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: yes, some of my bosses are heavy AI users and the general work culture is pushing for more and more AI use

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: one time I needed to compress a SQL query under a certain character limit, and I included in the instructions to have the AI tell me if its not possible. the responses were all over the character limit and the AI refused to say it was impossible until I pressured it by asking explicitly if it were possible. I wasn't terribly frustrated but it would have been more helpful to just say it wasnt possible or to suggest a different approach that fit the limit but had slightly different results (which I came up myself, but then used AI to populate the full query since it was a bit of boilerplate).

AI: That's a really concrete example of where the interaction could have been more helpful. It sounds like you wanted more honest assessment and alternative thinking from the AI rather than just repeated attempts.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: as I mentioned before, I want to maintain some skills myself (coding, writing). I also want to maintain problem solving skill as well, but I'm wiling to use AI to buff my problem solving. Coding for me is an enjoyable activity, so obviously not being able to code anymore would make me pretty sad. Writing skills, as I mentioned, is a source of pride, so losing that would be like losing a little bit of my identity. problem solving and critical thinking, in my opinion, are pretty important to being independent, and I really don't like having to rely on things or people other than myself. 

I think even if AI takes over for these skills (or lets just say my job), I feel there's always a market for doing these things as a hobby or on the side. however that really depends on how society evolves with more and more AI being available - and currently it just seems like there's too many unknowns to predict how things will be

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the distinction between skills that bring you joy, skills that define your identity, and skills that preserve your independence is fascinating.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Its highly likely that I'll have to do more and more with AI, whether I want to or not. I do intend to use AI for more summarization and investigation, as we have a lot of documents at work where AI summaries could be helpful, but since I'd have to paste the text into an AI tool, its a little cumbersome to use at the moment. We are working on our own internal models so as those get better I'll start using them. Of course, if we ever reach the point where we're not allowed to code anymore, then I might be quitting shortly after.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed that clear decision tree for when to use AI versus other resources, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining the skills that bring you joy and preserve your independence.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: cant think of anything so no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI as a tool while preserving the skills and activities that matter most to you personally will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you spoke about both the practical benefits and the boundaries you've set around AI use. Have a great rest of your day!
