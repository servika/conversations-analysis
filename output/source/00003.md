Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I create simple content for Muffin Break, a cafe retail chain in AUstralia. I recently started a marketing role in a startup in afterhours and have been exploring video and image generating through different platforms

AI: That's really interesting - so you're working across both established retail marketing and startup environments. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I generate prompts for videos/images from AI as they can provide a better description for me. I also generate a lot of copywriting from AI like captions. I use platforms to generate and fine-tune image too - should I provide examples of the AI models?

AI: You don't need to list all the specific models right now, but I'd love to hear more about how you're using AI for those prompts and copywriting.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I had to generate a tagline for a coffee bean award our company has won. We won an award in alternative milk, decaf, expresso and milk based coffee - basically everything. We want a tagline that connects to customers, showcases our versatility and still be concise. I felt like different models have different abilities to generate a tagline. I was happy with the results and had a conversation to explore all possible options.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive approach - using the AI almost like a brainstorming partner to explore different directions for that tagline.

When you're working with AI like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It really depends on the model I am using. I prefer chatbots with follow up questions, as without them it feels one way. For models that provides follow-ups and their own thoughts or perspectives, I think AI does consider things that I haven't considered before. Not to mention the depth of wordings that AI can provide. With the right prompting, I see copywriters role being deminished and the demand for them would decrease.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're making between different types of AI interactions - the follow-up questions really seem to change the dynamic for you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think it would be copy writing. I need the idea myself but AI helps me execute them very efficiently. I think image and video generation is still not up to standard for my liking (I have been using free models for them). 80% of the images and videos are not what was desired. I think having editing function would be a game changing feature for these image generation models.

AI: So it sounds like AI has really transformed your copywriting workflow, but the visual content generation still has some gaps for you.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My concern how our creativity would be diminished and everyone would have similar ideas based on AI models. It is such a shortcut when you can have 10 captions generated for you in a second that is 80% better than your own written one, so whats the point of writing it ourselves? Also AI provides a lot of generic content in terms of writing marketing briefs and people that are not professionals would not know how to tell which one is which.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the homogenization of creative output and people not being able to distinguish quality. It sounds like you're seeing both the power and the potential pitfalls firsthand.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see free models having more advanced image/video generation models. I see a streamline of prompt generating and feeding within the same conversation to generate amazing images. I also think the step up on AI reliance would actually be surprisingly slow, as people come to realise that their biggest assets are still their own brain. I think AI will progress in a marginally slower pace than the past 5 years in terms of creative work or in general.

AI: That's a really interesting prediction about the pace slowing down, especially your point about people rediscovering the value of their own thinking.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how different AI models create different collaborative dynamics - that distinction between one-way versus conversational interactions seems really important for how the creative process unfolds.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced differences between AI models, the current limitations in visual content generation, and your thoughtful concerns about creativity and quality have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
