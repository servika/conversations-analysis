Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great, I have no questions at this point.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, I use it for a variety of tasks as a self-employed virtual assistant. I work in a variety of areas such as retail admin, business start-ups, social media, but the main bulk of my work is in the eCommerce space and helping business manage their online business using eCommerce platforms. In a typical work day, I use AI to generate ideas for content, but never to actually write the content from scratch. I will be giving it some prompts and trying to collaborate I guess, to enhance ideas from my own brain. This could be ideas for a social media marketing campaigns or even something as simple as a post I'm struggling to make. With stuff like retail admin, I have used AI (moreso in the past) to take care of regular emails, draft responses to unimportant stuff. And the most regular processes in the business. Never the most important stuff though. I have helped set up AI chatbots and assistants, though I don't personally use them. I use stuff like grammarly to check grammar, but again, I'll always pay attention because all of these things can make mistakes. I have tried using AI for analytics for eCommerce platforms, CRM software etc. I've also dabble with using AI tools to edit visual stuff like social media content and logos.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview - it sounds like you've explored AI across many different aspects of your work. 

You mentioned that you use AI to generate ideas for content but never to write content from scratch. Can you tell me more about what that collaboration process looks like for you? How do you typically work together with AI when you're developing those ideas?

User: Yeah, so say I get a task to do something and come up with an initial idea, but I feel like the idea is lacking or could be better - but I'm not sure how or in what way - I will type the whole situation or scenario into AI and ask for some ideas. I will read those ideas and decide if I like them. Often, I can take elements from a few different ideas to add to mine to make a good idea. I know AI lacks creativity somewhat, so I feel like they give me a good starting point to develop an idea further. I tend to ask for at least 10-15 ideas for something because I often don't vibe with what it gives me.

AI: That's really interesting how you use that volume of ideas as raw material to work with. When you say you "don't vibe" with many of the AI's suggestions, what usually feels off about them? What makes you gravitate toward certain elements over others?

User: It's usually a creativity issue. The ideas suggested are often too generic for me or just sound like they're trying to shoehorn every little detail I've offered in my prompt into it, rather than providing something more creative that might stand out. I will gravitate towards the elements I feel are different and capture the vibe of what I want without leaning too far and obviously into it. I often have to push and push for more ideas.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you're really looking for that spark of something unexpected rather than just a formulaic response. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned there are certain tasks you'll use it for, like drafting responses to unimportant emails, but never the most important stuff. What makes you draw that line? Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: It's mostly because I used to use it for more tasks, but I realised there were too many errors and issues to delegate important stuff to AI. I'd end up checking everything a few times, and realised it wasn't saving time. I prefer to handle any data analysis and write-ups, such as analytics and shopify/etsy stats, as I know it's all correct. Stuff like bigger campaigns for social media, I could use AI for graphics and stuff, but I prefer paying creative humans to do that or doing it myself. At the end of the day, if I used AI for all of my writing materials, it would end up sounding formulaic and like many other peoples content online who are also clearly using AI. It's like, I want to preserve the personality of my stuff

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - preserving that personality seems like a key factor in your decision-making. You mentioned you used to delegate more tasks to AI but pulled back after realizing the time spent checking outweighed the benefits.

Can you walk me through what that realization process looked like? Was there a particular moment or task where you thought, "This isn't actually helping me the way I expected"?

User: Yeah, so there was a point when I maybe took on more clients than I could handle, and when I had a few dashboards full of stats, and got asked for yearly/monthly/campaign end reports, I attempted to use AI to analyse the data and draft some of these. When I went back through them, they mostly needed rewriting and recalculating so it didn't save me any time. I found this would happen quite it abit, so I haven't really tried it recently. Like it saved no time, rather the opposite

AI: That sounds like a frustrating experience - essentially creating more work for yourself instead of less. 

When you do use AI now for tasks like generating content ideas or drafting those routine email responses, how do you think about maintaining your skills in those areas? Is preserving your own abilities something you actively consider, or does it feel more natural since you're still so hands-on with the process?

User: I definitely consider preserving my own abilities, hence why I never use AI ideas from scratch and only use it to enhance my own ideas. I feel like you can use it to enhance your own abilities. I'm also mindful about preserving the ability of others - hence why I prefer to use creatives for visual stuff over AI. Routine stuff like basic emails, I honestly don't care. Email writing is not a deep skill, I'll be doing that when I'm 85 and half-dead. AI is a skill in itself, if that's the way the world is moving, I'll be the kind of person to move with it - ethically.

AI: I appreciate how you've thought through both the personal and broader implications of AI use. You mentioned being "the kind of person to move with it - ethically." 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation that created that feeling?

User: Yes, so generating ideas for social media can be annoying. As I said, models lack creativity and it takes a while of back and forth to generate ideas that seem unique and that have personality. But then there will be one thing where you're like, "yes!!" that's helpful. This can help my develop my idea now. But I suppose searching for inspiration irl is the same process really. I'm not sure I've feel incredibly satisfied lol, as it can still make errors.

AI: That "yes!!" moment is really interesting - it sounds like when it works, it's less about the AI giving you a perfect solution and more about it sparking something that helps you move forward with your own thinking.

How have your colleagues or clients influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself having conversations about it, or does it mostly stay as your own behind-the-scenes process?

User: We don't really have conversations about it to be honest. I work for myself, plus I don't really talk to clients about this kind of stuff.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like it's really your own personal workflow tool rather than something that comes up in client conversations.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue with this current approach, or do you see it changing as the technology develops?

User: If technology becomes better, I would definitely consider using it more in my work. I think I like my approach of using it to enhance rather than relying on it. I'd hate to become so reliant on it that someone asks me to do something without it and I'm like "idk what im doing". It's important to maintain a real-life skill set too.

AI: That's really insightful - maintaining that balance between leveraging the technology and preserving your core competencies.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to enhance rather than replace your own creative process, and how you've learned to draw clear boundaries based on actual experience rather than just assumptions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think I'm good. Thanks.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between enhancement and independence, and how you've adapted your approach based on real-world results, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
