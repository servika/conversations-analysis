Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I have no questions yet

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work several different creative roles day-to-day and I use AI mostly for inspiration, summarisation and creativity. I have to read and write a lot for work as I write blogs, sometimes this involves listening to podcasts, reading transcripts and it can be very lengthy so I will use AI to summarise certain parts for me so I can gauge a generalised understanding first of all. I also use it to help create me thumbnails/images or expand on existing ideas. I commonly use it to create catchy sub-headings and titles to fit a certain theme/narrative. I do also use the featured to summarise email threads so I have to spend less time reading through each email. I always use it as a helpful tool rather than a standalone tool, I always adapt what it gives me rather than just trusting it. I also work as a relief Pharmacy Assistant which AI comes in handy when needed a quick explanation for something.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of creative and analytical tasks. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you always adapt what it gives you rather than just trusting it. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself entirely, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Researching things primarily and also transcripts, many times the AI will get the transcript wrong as it doesn't 'hear' the same as a human so many of the words are incorrect meaning that if I just copied and pasted some of the transcript into my blog or used some of the terms it gave me without checking them myself then my blog would be wrong. An example I had recently was the model has misheard a place that was mentioned and gave me an incorrect meaning and acronym which would have made no sense in the blog to those that were experienced in the topic but me as the writer did not know at the time, so if I didn't double check myself I would have handed in the work wrong.

AI: That's a really concrete example of where human judgment becomes essential. It sounds like you've learned through experience where AI's limitations can create real problems if you don't catch them.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: 90% of the time it will be collaborating with AI throughout a task on an 'as and when' basis if I need the extra help. I rarely, if ever, delegate a task to the AI to do on it's own and even if I were to do this, I would be hesitant not to double-check it myself, so technically I'm still doing the work  in that scenario rather than allowing the AI to do it independently.

AI: That makes a lot of sense given what you shared about needing to verify accuracy. It sounds like you've developed a very hands-on approach where you maintain control throughout the process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: One of the companies I work for uses HappyScribe to translate the podcasts they do and they then send them to me for me to go through and write a blog on them, but I find the original podcasts to listen to alongside so that I am ensuring the translations are correct. AI is very well known and commonly used in work online, especially. Even in my pharmacy role, our medication is sent off to a warehouse for the 'robots' to pack, which is somehow integrated with AI.

AI: It's interesting how AI is woven into your workflows in different ways - from the HappyScribe transcripts you receive to the warehouse robots in pharmacy work. It sounds like you're working within systems where AI is already part of the infrastructure.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The example I mentioned above was the most recent example I can think of where it translated the podcast wrong (several times). One thing I felt particularly satisifed with is the creativity that some models can provide when giving them a rundown on an image that you want, it makes you look at things in a different light as you can see another take on an image you had in your head but the getting there can be frustrating as you have to refine the description a lot - if the model doesn't provide you with something you like, it's hard to steer it away.

AI: That's a fascinating contrast - the satisfaction of getting fresh creative perspectives but the frustration when you can't quite steer it toward what you're envisioning. It sounds like there's almost a communication challenge in getting the AI to understand your creative vision.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider it but I also don't feel like AI will every be as complex as a human brain - don't get me wrong AI is brilliant, it has amazing concepts in terms of researching, effectiveness, speed, analytical, analysis - I could go on. AI is smarter than a human as it is built to process a shit tonne of information to have ready at hand but creatively wise, it does not seem to get the emotional or creative aspects quite the same. What makes humans unique is their originality and I don't feel that can be replaced unless there were over 8.2 billion AI models that were each individually programmed with different circumstances. With humans, a lot of the time, their experiences/traumas help shape them, and they can become emotionally driven/inspired. For example, someone might become an artist because they lost their home and family in a fire and they now paint the most amazing dark pictures because of it - how can you programme the same passion into AI you know? But I do think AI will replace the repetitive tasks to free human time.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on what makes human creativity unique. The way you describe emotional experiences and personal history driving creative expression is compelling - that connection between lived experience and creative output.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it can only get better. The more AI learns and develops from individual experiences in training, based on the feedback humans give will help to adapt AI for the better. There will be new challenges of course, same with everything, but I do think that the relationship I have with AI at work will evolve positively and progressively.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how human creativity stems from emotional experiences and personal history - that was a really compelling way to think about what makes human contributions unique.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of right now

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of your AI interactions, the importance of human verification, and your thoughtful perspective on creativity versus efficiency will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the benefits and limitations you've encountered - that kind of honest feedback is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are actually being used in the real world.

Have a great rest of your day!
