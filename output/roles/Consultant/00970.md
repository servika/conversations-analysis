Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's get started.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: It is used at work to research and find infomation specific to maritime safetytech

AI: That's interesting - maritime safety tech is such a specialized field. 

Tell me more about that research process. What does a typical information-gathering session look like when you're using AI for maritime safety tech topics?

User: First of all we have a topic or specific piece of saftey tech that we want to talk about.  We then ask AI what it knows about this topic and who are the main players in the market.  The same question is given to AI 3 times to make sure that it is consistent to help eradicate errors on the research.  The idea is that if the AI gives us the same results then it hasn't made anything up.

AI: That's a really methodical approach - asking the same question three times to check for consistency. 

When you get those results back, what do you typically do with the information AI provides about the market players and topics? Do you take that as your final answer, or does it lead you somewhere else in your research process?

User: It depends.  We generally take that as the final answer and use it for mareting or promotional material.  The results may be used internally to do further research into safety tech companies to help explore a particular niche in this sector.

AI: So the AI research serves different purposes - sometimes it's the endpoint for marketing materials, other times it's the starting point for deeper investigation.

When you're using those AI results directly in marketing or promotional material, how do you handle situations where the three responses might vary slightly, or when you need to verify the accuracy of what AI has told you about these maritime safety companies?

User: There is a general assumption that the AI is correct.  In the unusual case where there is a dicrepency between answers we take any answer that is common across at least two answers.  We have never had the case where we have had three totally different answers.

AI: That's a pretty high level of trust in the AI's accuracy for your field. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your maritime safety research that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: AI is generally used just for marketing research.  For deep research into a particular subject we don't use AI but talk to industry player, publications and google.  Maybe AI could assist with that task to, or even the writing up of research findings, but it isn't used for this.

AI: That's a clear distinction you make - AI for the initial market overview, but human sources for the deep dive research.

What drives that decision to stick with industry players, publications, and Google for the deeper work rather than bringing AI into that phase as well?

User: For the deeper work we stick with non-AI tools as there is a distrust of the answers.

AI: That distrust for deeper work is really telling - especially given that you trust AI for marketing research. 

Can you help me understand what creates that difference for you? What is it about the deeper research that makes AI feel less reliable compared to the marketing overview work?

User: I think we see marketing as 'non-essential' from a consultants point of view, but when we are working of deep dive research for a customer we want to provide accurate answers and have all the knowledge to back up our reports.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's a real distinction between the stakes involved in marketing materials versus client deliverables.

When you do use AI for that marketing research, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the research process, or do you tend to give it the task and let it handle it independently?

User: The typical interaction would be 'please provide information on xxxxxx and give me a list of the main technology companys involved in that field'.  We then ask the question three times to get an answer.  We don't have a back and forth conversation.

AI: So it's more of a delegation approach - you give it the specific request and expect a complete answer rather than working through it together.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are you all on the same page about using it for marketing research but not deeper work, or did that approach develop over time?

User: As AI became more available to us we evolved into this way of working.  We may use AI more inthe future but there is a general concensus that we don't trust it to do the real work.  MY colleagues have influenced me by agreeing with my general cynisism ove rthe use of AI.

AI: That shared skepticism among your team seems to really shape how you all approach AI - it sounds like it reinforced your initial caution rather than pushing you toward broader adoption.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I feel particularly satisfied pretty much everytime I use AI in this way as I always get an answer I can use which saves a lot of time.  I can't think of any frustrations so far, maybe if we checked the answers more thouroughly we would find some innacuracies but nothing has been highlighted yet.

AI: That's really positive that it consistently delivers usable results and saves you time. The fact that you haven't encountered obvious inaccuracies yet seems to validate your three-question approach.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given that you find it so effective for the marketing research tasks?

User: Through our work we are constantly talking to the main actors in the maritime sector that gives us knowledge which is our percieved value.  The personal interaction is what sets us apart, particulrly in an industry that is very wary of new technology.  Maintaing this is very important as a defence against the use of AI.  Whenever we talk to a client we must be able to talk the talk, not just regurgitate information.

AI: That personal knowledge and ability to "talk the talk" with clients sounds like your competitive edge - especially in a sector that's already cautious about new technology.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it staying in that marketing research role, or might those boundaries shift over time?

User: The boundaries may shift over time but I cna't see that happening any time soon.  Possibly in another 20 years or so.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the stakes of different tasks - marketing versus client work - really drives where you're comfortable using AI, and how that shared team skepticism has shaped your approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the methodical approach you've developed - especially that three-question verification method - and the clear boundaries you've drawn between marketing and client work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
