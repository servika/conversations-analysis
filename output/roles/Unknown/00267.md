**Transcript ID:** When you say you use AI as a ""second opinion

---

" can you give me an example of a situation where that second opinion was particularly valuable to you?

User: There are times when I've read something online that is out of my typical expertise.  I find it valuable to drop that info in to AI, tell it what I am thinking or what I think I've learned and will ask AI to help me solidify the concepts for me, just help me make sure I am understanding correctly.

AI: That's a great example - using AI to help you process and validate your understanding when you're working outside your typical expertise. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I do not delegate complete tasks

AI: You don't delegate complete tasks - that's clear. So it sounds like you're always involved throughout the process.

What keeps you from delegating complete tasks to AI? Is it about trust, the nature of your work, or something else?

User: Trust mostly, but my days are not well structured.  I never know what I'm going to have to work on from day to day.  It would be extremely hard to delegate tasks

AI: That makes complete sense - the unpredictability of your daily work combined with trust concerns would make delegation really challenging.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people around you using it similarly, or are you seeing different approaches?

User: I am an independent contractor, so I'm the only decision-maker for how things get done.

AI: Ah, that's a key detail - being an independent contractor definitely gives you complete autonomy over your AI usage.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I get frustrated whenever AI produces an incorrect analysis, or miscalculates a simple summation.  If I am run into a situation where AI does not produce a useful output, I just stop using it

AI: That's understandable - incorrect analysis or miscalculated sums would definitely be frustrating, especially when you're relying on accuracy for your work.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling particularly satisfied? What made that experience stand out?

User: I've asked AI to research specific topics and the results were more thorough than I was expecting.  I am satisfied when AI uncovers insights that are beyond a basic google search

AI: That's a great example - when AI goes beyond what you could easily find through a basic search and provides those deeper insights.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not at my current job, no.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: My job is likely to be rendered unnecessary by AI, so my career is going to have to evolve before my AI skills evolves within this job

AI: That's a pretty significant perspective - the sense that AI might ultimately replace your current role entirely rather than just augmenting it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your candid perspective on using AI as a backup and second opinion, and how the unpredictable nature of your daily work makes delegation challenging.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty about both the benefits and limitations you've experienced, from the frustrations with incorrect calculations to the satisfaction when AI uncovers deeper insights than a basic search would provide. Your perspective as an independent contractor who uses AI primarily as a validation tool rather than for delegation offers valuable insights into how different work contexts shape AI usage.

Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
