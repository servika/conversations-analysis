Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. No questions yet.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for several tasks throughout the day. I usually use it for meeting notes/recaps, filler content creation, and scratch app generation. Occasionally I will use it to help polish a message so it is appropriate for a client.

AI: That's a nice range of tasks. When you mention "filler content creation," what does that typically look like for you? What kind of content are you creating?

User: General business content so that our product demos look realistic. Think reports, docs, slides, emails, etc.

AI: I see, so you're creating sample content that makes your product demonstrations feel more authentic and relatable. That makes a lot of sense.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Generally I prefer writing my own messages and emails. Being a remote worker I feel like the human interaction is already pretty removed from the equation. Because of this, I prefer to write my own communications when possible. (polishing up messages notwithstanding)

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction – maintaining that human touch in your communications while still leveraging AI for polishing when needed. The remote work context adds an interesting layer to that consideration.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Generally I like to delegate. In the case of app creation it is usually a collaboration, though.

AI: That's interesting – so you have different approaches depending on the task. When you're collaborating on app creation, what does that back-and-forth typically look like? How do you and the AI work together through that process?

User: I'm not a developer so it usually looks like me requesting the AI create an app. Once the AI has given me the code, I will run it. At this point I usually encounter errors.  I will usually go back and forth with the AI until the errors are resolved.

AI: That makes sense – you're essentially troubleshooting together until you get a working result. It sounds like the AI becomes your coding partner even though you don't have that technical background yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: There is some significant pressure from management to start using AI whenever and wherever possible. One coworker doesn't even seem to think for himself anymore, as he relies on AI for everything. This has actually made me want to use AI only when necessary, interestingly enough.

AI: That's a fascinating reaction – the pressure and seeing a colleague's complete reliance actually pushed you in the opposite direction toward more selective use. That tells me a lot about how workplace dynamics can really shape individual approaches to these tools.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently used AI to write a little app that makes massive formatting changes to different documents and then leverages an open source python module to convert the doc to a different file type. I was able to get the app up and running in about an hour. The app takes about 1 minute to run. I think it probably would have taken me 6+ hours to make the changes to these docs myself.

AI: That sounds like a really powerful example of AI amplifying your capabilities – turning a 6-hour manual task into a 1-minute automated process, and getting it built in just an hour despite not being a developer yourself. That's quite a productivity leap.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that it is important. Even if not professionally.

AI: Tell me more about that. What drives that feeling for you – is it about staying sharp intellectually, or are there other reasons you think it's important to maintain those skills?

User: Basically, yeah. I still want to be able to think and create. I appreciate what AI can do for my productivity at work, but being able to just do human things is important to me.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective – valuing those uniquely human capabilities alongside the productivity benefits. It sounds like you've found a balance between leveraging AI as a tool while preserving the parts of work and thinking that feel essentially human to you.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am honestly not sure. I think that it will progressively do more and more of my job for me. I'm pretty sure I won't need to do so much troubleshooting with AI generated code in the future.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how workplace pressure actually made you more selective about AI use, and how you're thinking about maintaining those human capabilities alongside leveraging AI's productivity benefits.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think we covered it all

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciated how candid you were about the workplace dynamics and your thoughtful approach to balancing productivity gains with maintaining your own skills and human touch.

Have a great rest of your day!
