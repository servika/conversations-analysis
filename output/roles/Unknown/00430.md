Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for creating product descriptions for e-commerce sites

AI: That's interesting. Tell me more about that - what does the process of creating those product descriptions look like for you when you're working with AI?

User: I'll typically provide an image or the title of the product and ask for it to create the description. Providing an image works better as the AI utilizes some of those features in its description.

AI: That makes sense that images would give you richer descriptions. When you get that initial description back from the AI, what happens next? Do you typically use it as-is, or do you find yourself making adjustments?

User: Sometimes I ask to shorten it or add bullet points for certain aspects of the products, but a lot of times it is as-is

AI: So it sounds like you're getting pretty good results right out of the gate. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Typically less monotonous tasks because I find more enjoyment in those tasks, but when there's lots of products creating those descriptions are a hassle so AI makes that better

AI: That's a helpful distinction - you keep the more engaging work for yourself and let AI handle the repetitive parts. When you are using AI for those product descriptions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout creating a description, or do you tend to give it the task and let it handle it independently?

User: I tend to let it handle it independently probably 90% of the time.

AI: So you're mostly delegating complete tasks to it. That's efficient. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They gave me the idea to use it in that way as some other people had experimented with it first and had success with it. It allowed me to free up more time for other tasks

AI: So you learned from their experimentation and adopted their approach. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time I used AI for product descriptions I was amazed with how well and unique it was able to make the descriptions to allow similar products to still look like time was put into each one separately.

AI: That sounds like a really positive moment - seeing that the AI could create distinct, quality descriptions even for similar products. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider it since a lot of my job is data entry based. But the data entry is the most time-consuming part of the job. The other half requires staying up to date with consumer buying trends and what is trending within merchandise to be able to make sound financial decisions. That part I don't see being lost to AI anytime soon.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - recognizing that while AI can handle the data entry portion, the strategic trend analysis and financial decision-making still requires your expertise. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will only help better my workload while also improving my work/life balance while increasing happiness at work

AI: That's a really positive outlook. Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI handles the repetitive tasks while you focus on the strategic trend analysis and decision-making.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that covered it all

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for product descriptions, learning from colleagues, and how it's freed you up for more strategic work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: You're welcome, thank you for the time

AI: Thank you so much! Have a great rest of your day.
