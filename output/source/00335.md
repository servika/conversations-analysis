Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I have not questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI frequently when sending and replying to emails. I also frequently use AI from brainstorming. I am teaching a new subject and use AI to help develop creative ideas on how to teach subjects. I also use it to develop my lesson plans for the week.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into both your communication and your teaching preparation. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for developing those creative teaching ideas. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: Some of the lesson involve concepts I haven't seen in 20+ years. I use AI to help relearn these concepts. Also, my students tend to shut down when they do not understand the vocabulary. AI helps me convert the lessons into understandable texts. The curriculum tends to be too difficult for my students to understand on their own.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to bridge that gap between the curriculum and your students' needs. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, I prefer to build out spreadsheets, power point presentations, and formatting word documents myself. It seems to take more time to have AI build these out to my specifications. The AI used tends to be overly general and fails to include all parameters requested. This is especially true if numerous turns are needed with the AI model.  The difference is that these documents tend to be highly specific.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like when you need something very specific to your exact requirements, the back-and-forth with AI becomes less efficient than just doing it yourself.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: My typical interactions involve a more collaborative approach. If I am interested in having it build out a lesson plan, I will have the model start by building me a basic template that will be used to build out  the more robust document. Should I need a lesson plan built out, I will ask AI to review the curriculum and build out a lesson based on that. I will proceed by asking it to elaborate on some sections and convert the concepts into an easier to understand format. I will then input the details manually into the original template myself. If I ask AI to do it, it seems to have trouble remembering every details needed and fails to include everything. For instance, if I ask for multiple revisions, it will only focus on on revision at a time a fail to include all requested revisions.

AI: That's a really clear example of how you've found that sweet spot between leveraging AI's strengths while working around its limitations. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues have inspired me to be more creative in my approach. We bounce ideas off each other and share concepts we find helpful. Seeing my colleagues use AI to help with study guides and lesson plans helped inspire me to do the same as well as learn new innovative ways to teach the content.

AI: That collaborative environment sounds really valuable - it's great that you have colleagues who are open to sharing and exploring new approaches together.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was using AI to build out a 9 week strategy to present to district leadership. The model presented me with a good starting document. However, when asked to revise of elaborate in some sections, it would revise the entire document and leave important details out. This resulted in me breaking in down section by section and manually updating the starting document. After numerous failed attempts to have AI combine the sections, I gave up and did it myself.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you had a good foundation to work with but the AI kept losing track of the details you needed to preserve.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is important to maintain knowledge of skills AI could potentially take over.  While it can enhance efficiency, it is not always accessible. There is always a risk that AI may not be readily available especially during internet and electricity outages due to natural disasters or conflict.  Additionally, there may be circumstances where AI is too risky  to use due to potential security risk. AI is not  without errors. Human oversight is critical to validate outputs and catch any inaccuracies.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the practical limitations and risks that come with AI dependency. Your point about natural disasters and security concerns really highlights the importance of maintaining those foundational skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Yes, I see myself become more reliant on AI to complete more of the mundane tasks or quickly finish projects. I see this happening because of the increased productivity demands that are not feasible without utilizing AI. It is already evident that expectations have increased for individuals in the work place. To maintain any sort of work life balance, AI will become essential.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how productivity expectations are already shifting in response to AI availability, and how that creates this almost necessary adoption to maintain work-life balance.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the collaborative approach you've developed and your practical concerns about maintaining skills for when AI isn't available.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between collaboration and delegation, the importance of maintaining core skills, and how workplace expectations are evolving with AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
