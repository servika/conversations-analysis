Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use Gemini Pro for help with converting code to different versions, or help with debugging something if it's particularly difficult to track down a bug. I haven't really used it creatively for coding tasks, as I found it to be too inaccurate for many things I work on.

AI: That's interesting - you mention accuracy being a concern for creative coding tasks. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "too inaccurate" in that context?

User: Sometimes, it'll use deprecated code, or suggest libraries that are too old. That's the main issue. Other times, on occasion the code will simply not be accurate, and not work as intended.

AI: I see - so it sounds like reliability is really important in your work. When you do use it for converting code or debugging, what makes you feel confident enough to turn to AI for those specific tasks versus the creative coding work?

User: For debugging, it'll normally explain the bug well enough to where I can understand where to look for the issue. Sometimes it suggests fixes, which I do follow and verify with further testing. I've found that most of the time, the fixes are accurate, or at least accurate enough with some further tweaking to make it better.

For converting code, it's mostly for speed. For example, converting code from Vue 2 class-based components to Vue 3 composition api based components. The code is usually good enough where I can copy/paste it and make adjustments as needed. It's never 100% perfect, but it's good enough where it reduces the amount of time needed to convert the code.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've developed a pretty clear sense of where AI adds value versus where it might create more work for you. 

When you're working with AI on these debugging or conversion tasks, how would you describe your typical interaction? Are you going back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it the task and then take what it gives you to work with on your own?

User: SOmetimes I go back and forth, but normally I take what it gives me and work with it further. If I go back and forth, I found that inaccuracies tend to sneak in, or conversation history is forgotten. Mind you, this is with Gemini Pro.

AI: That's a really useful observation about how conversation history affects accuracy. So you've found a workflow that works around those limitations.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you do delegate?

User: Creating new components, or just creating new things in general. Gemini might help wtih syntax, but logic and architecture is something it can be bad at, I think.

AI: Tell me more about that - what is it about logic and architecture where you feel AI falls short?

User: For architecture, sometimes it tries to stick with DRY too much, which can make things a bit harder to understand. Other than that, it's a bit hard to explain. Logic ties into that.

AI: That's a thoughtful point about DRY principles potentially making code harder to understand. It sounds like there's something about your judgment as a developer - around readability, maintainability, the bigger picture - that you don't feel comfortable delegating yet.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We actually talk about it a lot. We use it for making the usual memes, but also have openly used it for help with our coding, figuring out bugs, and even some research topics using Deep Research. Our company has done hackathons with AI in mind.

AI: That sounds like a pretty AI-friendly environment! When you say you've used Deep Research for research topics, what kinds of things have you explored with that?

User: To my knowledge, only one thing involving postgres

AI: Got it. It sounds like your team is pretty open to experimenting with AI tools in different ways - from the playful side with memes to more serious applications like hackathons.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was pretty satisfied once I found that I could udpate code more quickly with Gemini. However, sometimes it forgot my previous instructions.

AI: What happened when it forgot your previous instructions? How did that affect your work in that moment?

User: I was copy/pasting code that I wanted to convert to the latest version of Vue, using `setup` and `defineComponent`. However, sometiems it forgot that instruction and gave me the composition API without `defineComponent`.

AI: That must have been frustrating to have to keep re-explaining what you needed. It sounds like you had to develop workarounds for that inconsistency.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes. So I'm learning more about using AI and programming AI stuff. I'm also looking at learning more languages to be more versatile, and using AI to help with that.

AI: That's an interesting approach - using AI to help you expand into new areas rather than just relying on it for existing work. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'll keep using it to assist with coding tasks, research, as well as learning new languages. I may use it to help me make an app for a side project.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've learned to work around AI's limitations - like keeping interactions shorter to avoid conversation history issues, and being selective about which tasks you delegate based on where accuracy matters most.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've developed practical workarounds for AI limitations, and your strategic approach to using AI to expand your skills rather than replace them, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
