Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a teacher, so AI tools are a huge help to me on a daily basis. I have been using it a lot to help me scaffold questions for different learners, help to come up with prior knowledge questions when introducing a new topic, and ideas to come up with common misconceptions regarding certain topics. Due to having a diverse group of learners in the classroom, there are many times where I need to come up with questions that need to fill some gaps in their content learning, so this is a good tool to gather that information from.

AI: That sounds like you're using AI in some really thoughtful ways to support your students. When you mention scaffolding questions for different learners - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you go about getting the AI to help you create those differentiated questions?

User: For example, the overlying question may be: Explain how indigenous populations used geography and climate to determine their way of life. I need to get a read on what the students already know before proceeding. There are questions that need to be asked to at appropriate times throughout the lesson to get a check on where the students thinking is. I might ask AI to help me come up with some questions or sentence starters to get kids thinking about the words geography, climate and indigenous, as these are going to be new words for them. I may also need some questions that students can relate to in order to get them to gain an understanding of those words.

AI: That's a really clear example. So you're essentially using AI to help you break down complex concepts into more accessible entry points for your students. 

When you're working with the AI to develop these questions and sentence starters, do you find yourself going back and forth with it - like refining and adjusting the suggestions it gives you - or do you typically get what you need from your initial request?

User: It depends. There are many times where I may not have been clear in the structure I am looking for in the lesson, so I need to fine tune my expectations. There are other times where I can take exactly what the AI has come up with and work it into my lessons.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like there's a real conversation happening between you and the AI as you work through what you need.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are certain objectives or standards that I have to teach by and certain structures that I have to follow (i.e. writing format) that AI could improve on, but due to some restrictions with curriculum I am unable to use it for that. But, yes, I think AI could do a great job helping with those things.

AI: So it sounds like there are some curriculum constraints that limit where you can use AI, even when you think it could be helpful.

Beyond those restrictions though, are there aspects of your teaching work where you actively choose to do things yourself - maybe because you find them more meaningful to handle personally, or because you feel like doing them yourself adds something important that AI assistance wouldn't?

User: When I am planning things individually for children, I want that to specifically come from me. It makes it authentic. Sometimes I write small quotes or questions for the kids to think about on their own and because I know them personally, it makes it more special.

AI: That's really meaningful - you're talking about those personal connections and knowing your students as individuals. It sounds like there's something important about that authentic relationship that comes through when it's directly from you.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I use it mostly for planning purposes. I like to use it as I am planning. I know my big ideas, so I use AI to help me break down the ideas into smaller chunks.

AI: So you're working with it as you plan - using it more as a collaborator to help you think through how to structure and break down your ideas rather than handing off complete tasks to it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the school environment shaped how you approach using these tools?

User: I think some of my colleague's use AI for planning, but we really don't discuss it. I use it consistently, as it speeds up the process for me to get all of my planning done but there isn't a push to use them in school at all. Some have mentioned using AI to create their exit tickets when they are done with a lesson.

AI: Interesting - so it sounds like AI use is happening but it's more of an individual choice rather than something that's being formally encouraged or discussed as a team.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was satisfied with the results when I added the questions AI came up with in my plans, my dean was impressed at the amount of detail that went into them. When I used the questions in class, they were valid and fit well into the interactions with the students. I haven't come across any frustrations with it as of yet.

AI: That's great that you had such a positive experience - both with your dean recognizing the quality of your planning and seeing how well the questions worked with your students in practice.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My skills are based on individual need, I have a hard time seeing AI take over the true quality of a seasoned teacher. The emotions that students display cannot be read through a chat message. There are certain areas in my field that AI will be beneficial for but the human-to-human interaction is paramount to the career and an AI can't pick up on that.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're highlighting something fundamental about teaching that goes beyond the content and planning aspects.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: I envision the usage increasing in other ways, maybe adding in some activities or looking to use it for creative stories that the kids can help develop. I need my students to be free thinkers, so we won't be opening it up to them yet.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the human-to-human interaction and emotional connection with students remains something uniquely valuable that you bring as a teacher.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's it.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a planning collaborator while maintaining those authentic personal connections with your students will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
