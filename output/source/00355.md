Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions, I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a customer service and sales rep, mostly communicating with customers via social media messages (X, Facebook etc.) and live chat. My company has incorporated AI into the customer communication process, so they will be greeted by an AI, asked important details like their identifying information, order number etc. The customer is then passed on to a human agent. Before the incorporation of AI, we had to gather the information from the customer ourselves. Additionally, I choose to use AI to help me with some tasks when I'm working in order to be better and more efficient at my job. I mostly use it for the sales aspect of my role. For example, if I have spare time I will have it brainstorm sales tactics with me, run over scenarios where I didnt make a sale in order to help understand where I can improve, help me to convey what I'm saying better or communicate more formally.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're experiencing AI both as something your company implemented and as a tool you've chosen to use personally. 

When you use AI for those sales improvements - like brainstorming tactics or analyzing scenarios where you didn't make a sale - can you walk me through what that interaction typically looks like? Are you working back and forth with the AI throughout the process, or do you give it a complete scenario and let it handle the analysis?

User: Definitely working back and forth, I don't tend to just take the first answer and run with it. There's often aspects I think could be improved or additional things I need to add.

AI: That back-and-forth approach sounds really collaborative. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When I'm dealing with customers or trying to close a sale, I like to handle that myself. In theory I COULD (and have) used AI to write several sales templates and scripts to follow, however I prefer to have organic human interaction and let my own personality shine through, so instead I use the scripts or tactics as more of an inspiration/jumping off point, rather than just following them word for word.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - using AI as inspiration rather than following it word for word. It sounds like you value that authentic, personal connection with customers.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the fact that your company already implemented AI for the initial customer greeting affected how you and your coworkers think about using it for other tasks?

User: Actually I have a lot of older colleagues who had never even heard of the concept of AI until the company started to implement it. They were a little skeptical at first, but I think this is understandable for anyone learning about a new concept for the first time. They tend not to use it for anything beyond how it's used already, despite me offering to help teach them about it. I use AI frequently outside of work, so for me adapting to the use of it in the workplace wasn't a big deal and I didn't feel influenced by others.

AI: It sounds like you're kind of a pioneer in your workplace when it comes to AI use beyond what's officially implemented. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was communicating with a particularly difficult customer over live chat, and felt like myself and the customer were just going in circles, they were very stubborn and despite my extensive experience of problem solving, we were at an impasse where no resolution I could give would satisfy them. During my break before going back to dealing with the customer, I ended up brainstorming with a chatbot about different approaches. I gave it the rundown of the issue, what I had tried and what hadn't worked, and asked if it could think of any alternative solutions to what I already had. It gave me about 4 or 5 other ideas, which I wrote down. After returning to my conversation with the customer, I threw some of these ideas out and the second one stuck! The customer was happy with what I offered, left feeling satisfied and I received a great review from them despite the initial dissatisfaction.

AI: That's such a great example of AI helping you break through a tough situation! It sounds like having that fresh perspective made all the difference.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's definitely something I actively consider. I worry that one day AI could go from being a helpful tool that makes my job easier and more efficient, to something that makes my job obsolete. This is already something I have experience with. One of my first jobs was for a company that owned many restaurant chains, basically taking call in orders for customers all over the country. It was simple but fun. I left that job for another opportunity in 2022. Out of curiosity, I recently looked up the company. Reading reviews, it turned out that the company had fired all of their employees and made the phone ordering system completely AI-based. I felt pretty sad for all the people who had been there for years and lost their job because of it. I feel as though customer service is one of the industries where I could easily be replaced in the future, it's actually made me consider working in a different field.

AI: That experience with your former restaurant ordering job must have felt quite personal - seeing AI completely replace roles you once held. That's a very real concern.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Given both your current positive experiences using it as a tool and your concerns about job displacement, how are you thinking about navigating that balance?

User: I feel that all I can really do is try my best, I don't think anything could replace real human connection, empathy and help, I remain positive that employers will consider this and use AI as a tool to aid workers, instead of a total replacement. I see my relationship with AI staying the same, possibly even using it more what with the ever-evolving capabilities it is developing.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as inspiration rather than following it word for word to maintain that authentic human connection with customers, and how you've navigated both the benefits and concerns around AI in your field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing I can think of! Thank you for your time, I enjoyed our conversation :)

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing the collaborative benefits of AI with maintaining authentic human connections, and your perspective on both the opportunities and concerns around AI in customer service work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really enjoyed our conversation too - you've given us some valuable perspectives to think about. Take care!
