Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have used, and continue to use AI at my workplace to help with the automation of repetitive admin tasks. This started about 18 months ago when I was using Microsoft Excel Power Query to analyze and present some work training reports in a more user friendly format. I knew the potential of Power Query & M language, but was not yet proficient at it. I used AI to continually help me create a flawless and almost fully automated workplace training tracker. I have now continued to utilize AI in the same way to automate and increase efficiency of tasks as they arise.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI became your coding partner for that Excel project. Tell me more about how that process actually worked when you were building that training tracker. What did a typical interaction look like between you and the AI?

User: I started by describing to the AI model where i was in the project and ask it to provide individual lines of code for me. Due to privacy restrictions by my workplace I cannot share confidential information so I would describe what I required but would use fake column and row names as place holders and then change it to the correct name. Then I would test the code and proceed accordingly. Now we are allowed, and encouraged to use AI on the work computers so it is a bit easier for me to request help and code.

AI: Interesting - so you've seen the workplace policy evolve from restrictions to encouragement over those 18 months. When you say you would describe what you required and then test the code, how much back-and-forth would typically happen? Were you building these solutions step by step with the AI, or would you get larger chunks of code to implement at once?

User: It was step by step lines of code for power query. When I first started i wasn't fully aware of all of the capabilities so i would first have to ask if what i wanted was possible and then prompt for the desired outcome code accordingly. Now with newer models this is must easier,

AI: That progression makes sense - from not even knowing what was possible to now having a better sense of the capabilities. When you say it's "much easier" with newer models, what specifically has improved about that interaction for you?

User: The code that the model produces is now almost flawless, whereas 18 months ago I would have to paste in the error messages for it to debug itself, often exposing a somewhat obvious error.

AI: That improvement in code quality must have made a big difference in your workflow. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI now. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I always still handle sensitive tasks myself, and only use AI for automation of data gathering. I still somewhat proofread all that I gather to confirm before sending out the data.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - keeping that human oversight on the sensitive work and the final review. When you're working on those automation tasks with AI, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more collaborating with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: No, I do as much as I can myself, as I've become much more proficient in power query because of the AI assitance, but if I struggle with something I will ask AI for help and then continue to if needed.

AI: That's really interesting - so the AI has actually made you more skilled at Power Query itself. It sounds like you've developed a kind of independence where you reach for AI support when you hit specific roadblocks rather than relying on it from the start. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes, I've found it to be a tool and I have made sure to learn whilst using it instead of fully relying on it. My colleagues are not fully aware that I use AI and all think I am extremely skilled at coding and power query. I keep the AI assistance to myself as I feel sharing this would weaken my position in the workplace.

AI: That's a really candid insight - so you're in a position where the AI has helped elevate your reputation as someone with strong technical skills, but you feel like revealing the AI assistance might undermine that perception. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The polished and final version of the training tracker I mentioned before not only got me an adhoc raise, but I have also rolled out to other stores across the area, this obviously led to a great feeling of satisfaction. What has frustrated me has been how late the company has been to embrace it, as they're only now encouraging staff to start dabbling and experimenting with it.

AI: That's quite an accomplishment - an ad hoc raise and rolling it out to other stores! It sounds like you were really ahead of the curve there. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes I do actively consider this, and as i mentioned before I make sure to use it as a tool so that I understand the code & automation it is producing so that if for whatever reason AI vanished tomorrow, I would not be exposed as a fraud.

AI: That's a strategic way to approach it - building genuine competency rather than just relying on the tool. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it is inevitable that my work place will adapt to rely upon AI strongly before eventually replacing a number of existing jobs with it. I think this will be a shame for some of the older staff who are less able or less willing to adapt, but I think it will be a great opportunity for people like myself to progress upwards and stay employed if we have a strong understanding.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning tool rather than a crutch, and how you're navigating the workplace dynamics around AI adoption.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thats all

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about learning alongside AI, navigating workplace perceptions, and staying ahead of organizational change will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
