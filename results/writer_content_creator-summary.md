## Representative Insights

### How Writers & Content Creators Use AI

1. "I generate prompts for videos/images from AI as they can provide a better description for me. I also generate a lot of copywriting from AI like captions. I use platforms to generate and fine-tune image too - should I provide examples of the AI models?"
   *— From conversation 00003.md*

2. "I think it would be copy writing. I need the idea myself but AI helps me execute them very efficiently. I think image and video generation is still not up to standard for my liking (I have been using free models for them). 80% of the images and videos are not what was desired. I think having editing function would be a game changing feature for these image generation models."
   *— From conversation 00003.md*

3. "I have reached for them to brainstorm ideas for certain projects or to help create catchy headings if my creative juices aren't flowing. A couple of times, if I've been particularly short on time, I've used them to create first drafts that I've then gone in to edit (usually quite heavily). I use AI more as a collaborator. I don't like to hand over the reins entirely!"
   *— From conversation 00006.md*

4. "I was tasked with writing some financial content for a website recently, which isn't something I'm particularly clued up on. I asked some LLMs to explain the concepts to me in a simplified manner so that I had a clearer idea before I started writing. I found this really helpful and insightful. I did do some online research, too, but the amount of information felt overwhelming, so it was nice to get some clarity."
   *— From conversation 00006.md*

5. "I am writing a novel and I've also written smaller novels and non-fiction books and training materials. But I probably use it most frequently for my novel lately."
   *— From conversation 00007.md*

6. "I don't think I do. I'm a little concerned about people not paying human writers to do what AI can do more quickly, but I think the people who do that probably couldn't afford to pay human writers appropriately, or would choose not to anyway.
I like to tell my kids that Steven King doesn't sell fewer books because VC Andrews also writes books. There is always competition and your readers will still love your work when you get it in front of them even if they do have other authors on the shelf."
   *— From conversation 00007.md*

7. "I mostly use AI for feedback and sometimes continuing when I have writer's block. So, typically I will have started a scene or started with an idea and I go to AI to bounce off what direction I'd like to take it. If I get a scene written by AI, I'll take that framework and re-work it to fit my voice and style."
   *— From conversation 00009.md*

8. "The worldliness of it. There are things I learn from AI to incorporate. For example, in the feature script I mentioned earlier, the protagonist travels to several countries I've never visited. AI helped me describe these places, the language, the culture more vividly and authentically. So it's expanded my reach I guess. I feel less limited."
   *— From conversation 00009.md*

9. "I don't have the fear that many writers do about AI taking over. I think people know what's real. I do. When I watch films or a series, it's clear to me when a writer's heart is not in it. I don't think those who use AI to write whole scripts without heavy human influence pose a real threat. It's like reality tv, when it's real and authentic, the shows hit. When the show becomes scripted, it falls apart. So, I believe in human discernment. I don't have concerns."
   *— From conversation 00009.md*

10. "I think AI will be more like how I use it. It wouldn't replace whole writers rooms but instead be a partner. It will expand the reach of writers. It'll work as a tool, just like a computer or camera."
   *— From conversation 00009.md*

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "My concern how our creativity would be diminished and everyone would have similar ideas based on AI models. It is such a shortcut when you can have 10 captions generated for you in a second that is 80% better than your own written one, so whats the point of writing it ourselves? Also AI provides a lot of generic content in terms of writing marketing briefs and people that are not professionals would not know how to tell which one is which."
   *— From conversation 00003.md*

2. "Honestly, I worry that it will make copywriting obsolete in the next few years. I have seen the improvements LLMs have made over quite a short period of time, and the output in terms of writing quality has improved substantially. If companies can get AI to produce writing that is up to or even beyond the standard of humans, why would they pay a human?"
   *— From conversation 00006.md*

3. "I don't think I do. I'm a little concerned about people not paying human writers to do what AI can do more quickly, but I think the people who do that probably couldn't afford to pay human writers appropriately, or would choose not to anyway.
I like to tell my kids that Steven King doesn't sell fewer books because VC Andrews also writes books. There is always competition and your readers will still love your work when you get it in front of them even if they do have other authors on the shelf."
   *— From conversation 00007.md*

4. "My self esteem regarding stranger and riskier ideas. LLMs have been great cheerleaders in that regard."
   *— From conversation 00008.md*

5. "I worry about people automating their music so much that the artistic economy collapses, and I worry about our artistic expressions getting buried beneath it all."
   *— From conversation 00008.md*

6. "I don't have the fear that many writers do about AI taking over. I think people know what's real. I do. When I watch films or a series, it's clear to me when a writer's heart is not in it. I don't think those who use AI to write whole scripts without heavy human influence pose a real threat. It's like reality tv, when it's real and authentic, the shows hit. When the show becomes scripted, it falls apart. So, I believe in human discernment. I don't have concerns."
   *— From conversation 00009.md*

7. "I won't lie--I have a lot of concerns. I think AI should truly just be helper and never a replacer. AI should be around to help us with the mundane things so that we can do the creating. I want AI to take care of the little stuff so that I can keep creating art and beauty. If AI does all the fun stuff, where does that leave us as a species? I believe our greatest strength as a species is art, so I don't like the idea of AI replacing that aspect of what makes us us."
   *— From conversation 00012.md*

8. "I'm not too concerned about AI in my field because AI was designed to mimic humans. People decrying AI as soulless imitation completely ignore that there are many uncreative humans out there with similarly uncreative works that just mashes together their favorite aspects of other works."
   *— From conversation 00020.md*

## Future Perspectives

1. "I imagine it will become an even more collaborative process, but I will continue to use it as I have, like an assistant rather than letting it do my job for me. I will continue to be proactive and have a high level of accountability in my work. I hope that people will still want that human connection with writing and that relationships that have been forged with my clients based on trust will continue."
   *— From conversation 00006.md*

2. "I think AI will be more like how I use it. It wouldn't replace whole writers rooms but instead be a partner. It will expand the reach of writers. It'll work as a tool, just like a computer or camera."
   *— From conversation 00009.md*

3. "I'm a novelist and I'm also learning how to write screenplays. With novels, my process is very chaotic but also very specific. I have no trouble coming up with ideas and I usually don't start writing until I know how it's going to end. This way, I make sure that I have a goal to shoot towards with every scene that I write. I don't outline and I also don't write in order. I also write very fast. I usually get a draft done within a month for a novel."
   *— From conversation 00012.md*

4. "Certainly. I use Adobe products and they are adding AI features regularly. That's only going to continue to grow."
   *— From conversation 00024.md*

5. "Thank you, that's about it! My final remark is that, while definitely not as big as a hobby, AI gives really great and fun suggestions for original home building ideas in Sims! I use it very directly for that all the time, and it's very fun and stress-free because I don't really care about those ideas as much. It gives great suggestions on types of homes or spaces I can build and what kinds of rooms I can make and what kinds of furniture I can use. I might use AI for building ideas in my story in the future, because I feel like that can be low-stress!"
   *— From conversation 00027.md*

6. "I was recently looking at medical/research applications of endosymbiote theory. Initially I was interested in finding the current state of the field, and running a literature review. The final output was proposals and ideas for future research."
   *— From conversation 00053.md*

7. "I imagine it will. As AI changes and becomes more reliable and hopefully able to run on less energy like most tech does as it grows it will become more viable for me to use it in an ethical way that adds value to my work."
   *— From conversation 00110.md*

8. "I have definitely started focusing on improving my domain-specific knowledge and tech skills. I have a financial and tax background with some computer science skills mixed in, and I find myself interested now in more technical topics, such as data analysis and coding.  I do feel uncertain about the future overall, but I hope to still provide value to employers and clients."
   *— From conversation 00111.md*
