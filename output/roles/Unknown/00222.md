Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have microsoft co-pilot integrated into my work laptop and apps so that's the main platform I use. I typically use it to ask questions which is especially helpful since I can upload work files to it without risking sharing private information. If I am working on Excel work, I may also ask it for sample formulas

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like the integration and privacy aspects are really important to you. When you mention asking it questions, what types of questions come up most often in your work?

User: I may ask it to provide me with Excel formulas, formulas to solve basic calculations, or especially these days, to draft emails for me

AI: Tell me more about the email drafting. What kinds of emails are you having it help you write?

User: All types of emails - internal emails, external emails with clients, etc. I have a template email that I like to use but especially with clients, if they come back with a whole list of questions or comments, it's useful to have them draft a response based on some bullet point responses that I enter in the prompt

AI: That sounds like a really practical workflow. When you give it those bullet point responses and it drafts the email, what do you typically do with that draft - do you send it as is, or do you make changes to it first?

User: I always make sure to change it and make edits. I use the draft as a starting point, but I always revise it first

AI: What kinds of revisions do you find yourself making most often to those drafts?

User: Typically formatting and changing the flow of the email, but I also like to change the tone of it to sound more like myself. In addition, at the end of the day, I know what the client is asking for and the responses better than the AI especially since I have more context so I like to also reword certain parts to make sure the point I want to make is made.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're really using your expertise and relationship knowledge to refine what the AI produces. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I typically prefer to handle technical tasks myself. I'm confident that AI could help with it, but sometimes when the data files are too large, I feel that it'll be quicker for me to just do it on my own rather than asking AI to do it and then reviewing since I may have to check too many things during my review

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - weighing the time it takes to review versus just doing it yourself. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I always collaborate and use it like an assistant or as a starting point. I still worry about any mistakes that could happen if I delegate AI to handle it on its own

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Our workplace strongly encourages the integration of AI. There has been co-pilot agents developed for company-wide use and my team itself has a small group of volunteers that are spending time brainstorming and trying out different ways that AI can help our specific team's tasks

AI: That sounds like a really supportive environment for AI adoption. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time it made me feel particularly satisfied was when I was trying to make a forms survey. AI helped a lot with brainstorming questions and getting an initial draft to the survey made. A time when I was frustrated was when I was trying to use it to help me make code for a macro but there was always some sort of error and it was not working. I tried to explain what was not working but there was no solution that worked

AI: That contrast is really telling - the survey brainstorming sounds like it played to AI's strengths, while the macro coding ran into some limitations. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I think about and have some worry over so I do try to maintain my skills in those areas. It can be a little overwhelming though with the speed at which AI is developing

AI: That feeling of trying to keep up with the pace of change sounds really relatable. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see myself trying to expand my uses beyond what I am currently using it for

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance collaboration versus delegation, and your honest reflections about both the benefits and the concerns around skill maintenance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative starting point, the importance of workplace culture in adoption, and the balance between efficiency and maintaining your own expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
