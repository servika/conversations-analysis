Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, I'm ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I own a transcription business where I am the sole employee. I have independent contractors that freelance for me, but no one else who works on the backend of things. Thus I use AI to help with things like finding sales leads, looking into new markets to offer my services to, writing blog posts about transctiption and languages, and for social media (generating ideas, writing captions, etc.). I typically use AI about 3 times a week, and on those days I will use AI for several hours.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become a significant part of your business operations. When you're using AI for several hours on those days, what does that typically look like? Are you working through multiple different tasks in one session, or diving deep into one particular area like market research or content creation?

User: I am usually focusing on one area for each day. So one day I will work on several blog posts, and then the next day of AI use I will be working solely on lead generation.

AI: That makes sense - having those focused AI days for different business functions. 

When you're working on something like blog posts for an entire day, can you walk me through how that typically unfolds? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI, or do you tend to give it complete assignments to handle?

User: Here is an example of a recent encounter. I wanted to write a blog post on 3 languages that were close to being extinct to highlight these languages. I asked the AI for 3 languages, and then kept asking (narrowing down my parameters and saying no to certain languages) until I got 3 I wanted to write about. I then asked the AI to write a blog post. I then worked collaboratively with the AI to refine the blog post until it was to my liking.

AI: That's a really interesting collaborative process you've described. When you were refining that blog post together, what kinds of changes were you typically asking for? Were you adjusting the tone, adding specific details, or something else entirely?

User: I usually asked the AI to be more specific, as it was giving general facts about the languages. That is good, but I wanted more about the morphology of the languages and other technical things. I would sometimes feed sources to the AI (like Wikipedia) to show what I wanted.

AI: That's really insightful - you're essentially teaching the AI to understand your specific expertise and the technical depth you need. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you collaborate closely on blog posts, but are there certain tasks in your transcription business that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I'm not exactly what else I could be using the AI for. I don't need it for scheduling or anything financial. I do wish it presented other ways it could help me that I haven't thought of.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - it sounds like you've found your main use cases but feel like there might be more potential you haven't tapped into yet.

Thinking about the tasks you do handle yourself - like the actual transcription work, client communications, or business operations - are any of those areas you'd want to keep doing yourself even if AI became capable of handling them well?

User: I am not against using AI for transcription, but I would definitely edit and proofread the transcripts myself. I don't think I would use it for client communication, as it just seems faster to do it myself and takes little time. I would have to see what it could do in regards to business operations.

AI: That makes sense - you want to maintain that quality control on the core deliverable while keeping client communications personal and efficient.

How have your independent contractors or clients reacted to you using AI in parts of your business? Has it come up in conversations, or influenced how you talk about your work process with them?

User: I have only had conversations about AI with my freelancers in regards to potentially asking them to edit AI-generated transcripts, which they are all in favor of. I did have one client ask about AI transcripts, but they opted to go with human-powered services because HIPAA was a concern. Other than that, no conversations around AI usage.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is becoming a practical consideration in your industry, especially with compliance requirements like HIPAA coming into play.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I really, really like AI for blog posts. It used to take me several hours to craft one post, and now I feel like I can write one that's even longer but shorter time-wise. I do sometimes have to double check sources as there have been some hallucinations, but it's still worth how much time I save.

AI: That time savings sounds significant - going from several hours to much less while getting even better results. 

When you mention having to double-check sources because of hallucinations, how do you typically handle that? Do you have a specific process for verifying the information the AI gives you?

User: I typically start with Wikpedia and the sources listed in Wikipedia. I use a lot of journals and scientific research as sources, as sometimes with these lesser-known languages there is very little on Wikpedia.

AI: That's a thorough verification process - using Wikipedia as a starting point and then diving into academic sources for the more specialized content.

How do you think about maintaining your expertise in areas like linguistics and language morphology, given that AI can help generate content? Is keeping up with your specialized knowledge something you actively consider?

User: I am constantly reading and learning about languages, so I try to keep growing personally. I do think I don't dive too in depth in my blog posts, so at a more surface level I don't need as much expertise. But I do feel a responsibility to post true things to the best of my ability and to cite my sources in my posts.

AI: That balance between accessibility and accuracy sounds important to your work - keeping posts approachable while maintaining your commitment to truth and proper sourcing.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it expanding into other areas of your business, or changing in how you use it?

User: I wouldn't mind expanding it, but I'm not sure in what ways. I think I would need guidance to show how it could help my specific business, which is 100% online. I do think it was expected in my industry that AI would completely take over transcription services by now, but we are still getting clients, so thankfully that hasn't been an issue so far. But I do see that it could be in the future.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've developed that collaborative approach to content creation and your systematic way of fact-checking AI-generated content.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI into your transcription business - especially that collaborative content creation process and how you balance efficiency with accuracy - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
