Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: There was a laboratory astrophysics experiment done about a decade ago in which two plasma jets were directed towards each other in order to produce a shock. There was fragmentation observed but the underlying instabilities couldn't quite be pinned down by experiment alone. 

So a few years ago I began doing computer simulations of these experiments, starting with a simplified hydrodynamic model and gradually adding in various pieces to make it look more realistic.  We got three papers published with a fourth on the way

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - going from experimental observations to computational modeling to understand the underlying physics. 

Tell me more about that process of gradually adding complexity to your simulations. What did those different stages look like as you moved from the simplified hydrodynamic model toward something more realistic?

User: So first we used identical jets in a hydrodynamic model with a power law model for cooling. This kept the math simple so that we could do analytical calculations to match the simulations. Already at that point we found two instabilities involved: The radiative shock instability, and the nonlinear thin shell instability.

For the next batch, we added a realistic cooling curve and also explored the possibility of jets being of different densities/velocities/radii. 

Then we when back to the identical jets with power law cooling but added magnetic fields. This resulted in us observing a third instability, similar in nature to the Kink instability of MHD

Lastly, I combined the results of the previous to, and the results were a pretty good mimicry of the experiments (though there is still room for improvement as there were some pieces of microphysics that were still omitted).

AI: That's a really methodical approach - building up the complexity piece by piece and isolating the effects of different physical processes. It sounds like each stage revealed new instabilities that weren't visible in the simpler models.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: At one point I had ChatGPT generate a few python scripts to help with processing the large numbers of images -- things like cropping, rotating, and stitching them into a gif.

AI: Interesting - so you used AI for the data processing and visualization side of things. 

For those image processing tasks, tell me about how you decided whether to use ChatGPT versus writing those Python scripts yourself or using your traditional approach.

User: I didn't have enough familiarity with any image-related python libraries, and figured ChatGPT would be faster than searching through StackOverflow

AI: That makes sense - leveraging ChatGPT's knowledge of libraries you weren't familiar with rather than spending time digging through documentation and forums.

Thinking about the other parts of your research workflow - the simulation setup, the physics modeling, the analytical calculations, or the paper writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I enjoy the analytical calculations most, so I don't want AI to take over that portion.

I consider using AI for paper-writing a form of plagiarism so I also refuse use it for that (beyond the aforementioned image manipulation scripts).

As for code-writing: I was using a fairly large and well-established codebase, so I didn't actually need to do tooo much code writing myself.  I have however given it a try on a different project with a smaller codebase, but even for that  one code was complex enough where AI makes too many errors.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you have clear boundaries about where AI fits appropriately in your work. I can hear that the analytical work is particularly meaningful to you personally.

When you mentioned that AI makes too many errors for complex code - tell me more about that. What kinds of errors were you seeing, and how did you figure out that the code wasn't working correctly?

User: In one attempt the AI accidentally commented out an entire file. 

In other cases, I checked to see if it was handling a certain case correctly, and by my own logical reasoning it did not handle those cases correctly.

AI: Wow, commenting out an entire file - that's quite a significant error that could be easy to miss if you weren't carefully reviewing the changes.

When you've used ChatGPT for those Python image processing scripts, how do you verify or validate what it produces? Do you approach that differently than how you checked the more complex code?

User: For those cases  I decided to just make a backup of the image I was using (or check that it was saving the output to a new file) and then run what it gave me and look at the output. In most cases the images turned out fine, in a couple I think some minor tweaks were needed.

AI: That's a practical approach - having a safety net and then testing visually to see if the output looks right. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: If AI could apply to grants that would be nice.
Alternatively it could be helpful for doing analysis of larger data sets (at the moment I don't trust it's accuracy and refuse to use it on something that is to large for me to verify by hand)

AI: Grant applications - that's something I haven't heard come up before! That's really interesting.

Tell me more about what makes grant writing feel like a good fit for AI assistance, especially given that you consider AI use in paper writing to be plagiarism?

User: Paper writing is a product of my research. That should be my own work.

Grant writing meanwhile is just asking someone for money.  Further, given the amount of time my PIs spend on this task, I suspect that using AI to help with one or more stages of the grant application process could be a game changer.

AI: That distinction makes a lot of sense - the research output versus the administrative process of securing funding. And you're right that grant writing can be incredibly time-consuming for PIs.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on where AI fits appropriately in scientific work and your clear boundaries around preserving the intellectual core of research were particularly insightful. You've drawn some really thoughtful lines between using AI as a tool for efficiency versus maintaining ownership of the scientific discovery process.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, I think that's all

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining the integrity of the analytical work while being pragmatic about using AI for tasks like image processing really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you made between research products and administrative processes like grant writing was particularly valuable.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I really appreciate the time you took to walk me through your approach!
