Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No. Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: We have an internal one at work where we can ask it to find specific information for us.  I also use it to compare documents for me.  It helps me find what I'm looking for much faster than me trying to search.  I will also use AI - either Gemini or ChatGPT - to help me troubleshoot any technical issues or errors with Windows.

AI: That's helpful to understand the range of ways you're using AI. You mentioned using it to find information faster than searching yourself - can you walk me through what that process looks like for you? How does using AI to search differ from how you used to find information before?

User: We have many documents that can be found on more than 1 website.  Sometimes it might take me awhile to figure out where a specific document is found.  When I am troubleshooting a specific analyzer, I may also ask it to find  very specific notes about any issues I may come across.  It saves me time for not only trying to search for the document myself, but also combing through long documents to find exactly what I need.  The AI will summarize the information it finds for me and provides a link to the document as well.

AI: That sounds like it's really streamlining your troubleshooting process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I also handle software upgrades and the document/guide we have can be quite long, but those I prefer to follow step-by-step rather than having it summarized because it is so technical and missing a step can lead to a much bigger issue and possibly a failed update.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the stakes are clearly different with those software upgrades. When you do use AI for work tasks like document comparison or troubleshooting, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: The instruments I look after are large Chemistry instruments in various medical labs.  Often times, a client will reach out to me about QC failing and they've already tried the basic troubleshooting steps on their own.  Sometimes, the client may have observed QC issues with more than 1 analyte.  One of our documents actually breaks down what the exact timing of the test times, exactly what fluids the instruments use, and what probes are used for the test.  I may ask the AI to compare different tests and tell me what is common between the troubling tests for a client.  I have been able to help my clients get back up and running by being able to identify a hardware issue right away and call in a field engineer.  This could save me hours or days troubleshooting with the client and in turn, help our clients improve patient care.

AI: That's a really compelling example of how AI can have a direct impact on patient care through faster problem resolution. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any particular encouragement, hesitation, or guidance around AI adoption?

User: My team has been quite open and accepting of this AI feature (we use Copilot).  Our team often shares insights of what worked for them, and even shares new ways they use Copilot for their day to day work. 

AI: It sounds like you have a really collaborative team environment around AI use. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was an online tool I used to compare 2 versions of a document to identify the updates.  My colleague decided to test our AI to see if it was able to do that task.  I now no longer have to copy and paste 2 versions into this tool.  The AI will automatically pull the documents and tell me what the updates/differences are!

AI: That's a great example of discovering new capabilities! How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No, I haven't considered AI being able to take over what I do.  I see it has enhancing productivity, but I do not think it can fully take over as there is also a personal aspect and customer/client relationship we maintain.  I have many responsibilities/duties in my job.  Besides troubleshooting, I do continuing education and advanced training with our clients.  Modern and larger labs are often quite automated now with a track system, but troubleshooting issues and hardware issues will require us to be at a client site in person.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the human elements that remain essential in your role. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Currently, our AI is limited to certain product lines only.  I'm looking forward to it being available for all our product lines as it has been quite successful with our flagship product.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you quickly identify hardware issues that can directly impact patient care - that's a powerful example of AI enhancing critical work rather than replacing human expertise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we've covered it all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI to enhance diagnostic troubleshooting while maintaining the essential human elements of client relationships and on-site technical work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you and your team have embraced AI as a productivity tool while clearly understanding where human expertise remains irreplaceable. Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
