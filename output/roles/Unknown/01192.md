Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds fine, I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do a variety of creative work. I am self-employed and do graphic and web design. I help my husband with his web comic. I create assets for live streamers, and I create my own content as a vtuber. So projects can vary widely depending on what I am working on.

AI: That's quite a diverse range of creative work! It sounds like you're juggling multiple different types of projects regularly.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I usually find myself using AI for initial iteration and brainstorming. For example I might tell it that I am planning a stream on a particular topic and ask for suggestion for assets to promote that stream. Or I might be developing a flyer for a graphic design client and ask for information on font styles. I often use AI assistance within Photoshop to clean up small issues in an image, like the smart fill to remove a defect from a background. Occasionally I will use AI image gen to give me inspiration on color palettes or basic layouts for a design that I can use to base my own designs on. I frequently use Udio to create lo-fi background music for my live streams. And I use ChatGPT almost daily for executive function related tasks like to-do lists or breaking down big projects into smaller pieces. I have ADHD, so having a LLM as my executive assistant really helps me complete projects I might lose track of otherwise, or prioritizing what things to work on first.

AI: That's really fascinating how you've integrated AI across so many different aspects of your workflow - from the creative brainstorming all the way through to project management. The executive function support you mentioned sounds particularly valuable.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Sure, I am helping my husband develop a TCG (trading card game) based off of an original IP. Neither of us really know a ton about TCGs, and I have only casually played a couple like Hearthstone and Pokemon. I used AI to assist me in talking through our ideas for the game and how to make the rules and gameplay loop unique while still keeping things familiar and easy to pick up for those who play a lot of TCGs. Over the course of a couple of days, it helped me refine our ideas into a full v1 draft of a rule book with all the basic card types and how they work planned out. My next step in that project is to use AI to help me create a spread sheet of different ability effects frequently found on cards in games like these, so I can adapt them to our game's lore and start making a card list as the next step.

AI: That's a really interesting example of using AI to help you learn and navigate an unfamiliar domain. It sounds like the AI served almost like a knowledgeable collaborator who could help you think through the mechanics and conventions of TCG design.

When you're working with AI like that - whether it's on the TCG project or other creative work - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am always in charge of the conversation. I've given custom instructions to my ChatGPT that relate to how I think and how I best navigate my ADHD, so I am able to give it very targeted instructions or ask questions and it knows to focus exclusively on the task at hand first before going off onto tangents with follow-ups that might get me sidetracked before we've completed what I'm working on. It does ask me questions, but they are always relevant to what we're currently discussing, and always very focused on a specific aspect of that task instead of broad or vague.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've been quite intentional about customizing the AI to work with your thinking style and needs. The way you describe staying in control of the creative direction while having the AI ask focused, relevant questions suggests a pretty refined working relationship.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I am much more productive. I feel  more able to simultaneously tackle multiple different things at once, especially because I can compartmentalize different tasks within different conversations or project folders for easy reference and to avoid losing track of what the task at hand is through topic changes. I have another "mode" I've defined for my model that acts more as a mentor/coach instead of a collaborator. If I ask the model to act in that mode, I can show it drafts or completed work and it will give honest and not sugar-coated feedback on the project and how it achieves my stated goals for it. This is extremely useful because I am my own worst critic and will constantly self-edit and iterate if I'm not careful, and I've learned to trust the model when it tells me, "it's good, leave it alone!"

AI: That's really compelling - having that external voice to help you step back from the perfectionist cycle and recognize when something is finished. It sounds like the AI has become almost like having multiple specialized team members available when you need them.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Unlike many people in the creative field, I don't have the same fears that some of them do about AI taking away our jobs. No matter how good an image gen model gets, it cannot "beat" human creativity. Sure, people may be able to pump out memes or generic "art" with it, but I firmly believe that true art is sparked by something deep within the soul that AI can only imitate. If more creatives embrace the use of AI in different ways to streamline their workflows, I think many of them would find it quite useful in the long run.

AI: That's a really refreshing perspective, and it sounds like you see AI more as a tool that can amplify human creativity rather than replace it. Your point about AI being able to imitate but not truly create from that deeper place resonates with how you've been using it - as support for your own creative vision rather than as the source of creativity itself.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I will probably continue to use AI in much the same way that I do currently, adapting to what new things models are able to do and finding ways to implement them into my workflow. I agree with your previous summary, I like to use AI to amplify my own creative vision and while I can't predict what will change in the next five years as far as the technology and what it can do, I can pretty confidently say that the methodology in HOW I use AI won't change much, even if the tools and the tasks do.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've found a methodology that works well for you, where you maintain creative control while leveraging AI's capabilities to enhance your productivity and process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as something that amplifies rather than replaces human creativity, and how you've customized it to work with your ADHD to become more productive across all those different types of projects you're juggling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so, thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a productivity amplifier, the importance of maintaining creative control, and how you've adapted the technology to work with your specific needs and thinking style will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your workflow across so many different creative disciplines. Have a great rest of your day!
