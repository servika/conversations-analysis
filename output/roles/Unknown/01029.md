Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions.  We can start the interview.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I often use AI to help me understand what my employer or a third party is asking for when they make a request.  I also often use AI to guide me when filling out a form like an export permit.  Sometimes I'll also use AI to ask about an advanced technical concept I'm not 100% confident about to ensure I understand it.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves as a kind of interpreter and guide for you in different situations. 

When you're trying to understand what your employer or a third party is asking for, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically present their request to the AI?

User: I'll often receive an email from my employer or a third party asking me a question that I don't know how to answer because I'm unfamiliar with the terminology or the knowledge area.  I'll give the AI the backstory about the email, show them the email, and then ask a series of probing questions about that email and what it's asking for.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to decode unfamiliar territory. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to do mathematical calculations by myself with the aid of AI.  This is because I use the aid of LLMs specifically and they sometimes making shocking errors when it comes to mathematical calculations.  Even more broadly, I try to avoid using AI for tasks that I'm completely familiar with and don't need to test my knowledge about with probing questions.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - recognizing where AI's limitations might create risks, especially with mathematical work.

When you do use AI for mathematical calculations, you mentioned doing them "with the aid of AI." Can you describe what that collaboration looks like? How do you structure that interaction to avoid those shocking errors you mentioned?

User: Apologies.  I made a mistake in my last message.  I meant to write "without the aid of AI" instead of "with the aid of AI"

AI: Ah, that makes much more sense - thank you for clarifying! So you handle mathematical calculations entirely on your own to avoid those potential errors.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I begin by presenting the LLM with the backstory of my query then ask a series of probing questions.  I try to avoid asking the LLM to do a lot in a single response.  I like to take it step-by-step, to ensure that I understand everything it's doing to resolve the problem I presented it.

AI: That step-by-step approach sounds very deliberate. It seems like you maintain a lot of control over the process rather than handing off complete tasks.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Some of my colleagues talk to me about how they use AI in their own work. However, their own use of AI typically doesn't influence how I use AI.

AI: Interesting that you've developed your own approach independent of your colleagues' methods. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recall an occasion where my employer asked me to figure out how the sensor fusion of visual odometry with an IMU would reduce the positioning error of an INS as compared to an INS with only an IMU that wasn't combined with visual odometry.

When I first asked a LLM about this, it suggested that the error would be reduced by a percentage that was well over 100%.

I responded by stating that reducing the error by over 100% wasn't possible, physically or mathematically.  I added that the percent reduction in the error must be between 0% and 100%.  The LLM's next response stated that I was correct and that the error would be reduced by as little as 0% or as much as 100%.

That entire experience was a total waste of my time and deeply frustrating.

That was actually my first time trying to use a LLM to help my with my job.  Months based before I tried using a LLM to help me with my job a second time.

AI: That sounds like a really discouraging first experience - especially when you had to correct such a fundamental error about percentages. It makes sense that it took you months to try again.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's important to keep one's skills sharp and moreover to grow and learn new skills.

I'm aware that a lot of white collar jobs like financial analyst are at risk of being replaced by AI.

However, my job is a R&D researcher in STEM and I'm question whether AI would have totally overtake such a job.  Especially in the cutting edge of innovative tech.

AI may eventually eliminate entry level positions, but I think there'll always be humans in senior positions and the impact will be greater in some industries more than others.

It's important to learn new skills in areas that AI won't take over for job security, but I still want to learn the skills that an AI is likely to take over.  I want to learn how to do things in general and not just for my job.  Learning is often its own reward.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - both practical about job security and driven by genuine curiosity to learn. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Recently, I've been using AI far more than in the past to help me with my work.

This is in part because I'm increasingly being asked to do administrative and financial tasks that don't interest me and I try to get AI to help me complete them more efficiently, so that I'll ideally have more time to do things that more interest me and may actually advance my career opportunities.

Since I've been using AI far more during these past few months than ever before and my employer continues to dump more and more administrative and financial tasks on me, I anticipate that my AI usage at work will only increase.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI strategically for administrative tasks to preserve time for more meaningful work, and how that early frustrating experience shaped your cautious but evolving approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing a step-by-step collaborative approach, learning from early frustrations, and strategically using AI to handle less interesting tasks will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
