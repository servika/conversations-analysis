Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds fine.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My job as a supply teacher is almost entirely social, so I don't really have any tasks that warrant the use of AI. However, the kids I work with often use it as an aid in their schoolwork.

AI: That's interesting - you have this unique perspective of seeing AI from both sides. Since you mentioned the kids use it as an aid in their schoolwork, what have you observed about how they're incorporating it into their learning?

User: I've worked extensively with 4th graders, and they use it as a research aid and to help design presentations. I sometimes guide them through it and help them avoid faulty answers.

AI: That sounds like you're playing an important role in helping them navigate AI effectively. When you're guiding them through it and helping them avoid faulty answers, what does that process typically look like? How do you help them identify when something might be off?

User: Well, considering the work I do with AI I have a good sense for when the model get something wrong, whether that's from outdated data or just hallucinations. Typically if a student uses AI for their work I just take a look to make sure it isn't misinforming them.

AI: That's a valuable skill to bring to the classroom. You mentioned you have your own work with AI that gives you that good sense for when models get things wrong. Can you tell me more about that work you do with AI outside of your teaching role?

User: No.

AI: That's fine. Going back to your teaching - when you're working with the 4th graders and they're using AI for research and presentations, are there certain tasks you prefer they handle themselves rather than getting AI help with, even when AI could assist them?

User: For anything that has to do with writing skills, AI is banned. It's a great technology but kids shouldn't be taught to rely on it. And with research, I try to get them to double check whatever the AI tells them, whether that's with me or with their own research.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the distinction between using it as a research aid versus letting it do the writing for them. When you have them double-check the AI's research, what does that verification process look like in practice? How do you teach them to validate what they're getting?

User: A simple google search is fine. If the most popular results agree, then it's probably ok. It's more about caution than thoroughness.

AI: That's a practical approach for that age group. When you're in the classroom observing the students work with AI, have there been any moments where you felt particularly satisfied or maybe frustrated with how the interaction was going? What was happening in those situations?

User: Not that I can think of. Children are easily misinformed and averse to research, so it never surprises or upsets me to see them get fooled by anything false. Never particularly satisfied either, as AI makes research very easy; it's useful, but not impressive. I'm more satisfied and impressed when they do their research without using AI.

AI: That perspective makes sense - valuing the skill development that comes from doing the research themselves. How do your colleagues or the school culture influence the way AI gets used in the classroom? Do you find there are shared policies or approaches, or does it vary from teacher to teacher?

User: Some teachers ban it completely, others allow it in limited ways. There's a consensus that kids should be able to do things on their own, without AI, but I see it as a tool that shouldn't be ignored. Also, it's worth noting that many teachers use AI for their lesson plans. I don't because supply teachers don't make lessons, but I would if I needed to.

AI: That's helpful to understand the range of approaches. Since you mentioned you would use AI for lesson planning if you needed to, I'm curious - looking ahead, how do you think about your own relationship with AI potentially evolving in your teaching career, especially if you move into more regular classroom roles?

User: I think I would use it mainly to help come up with ideas for lessons, and I would definitely give lessons on effective AI use. Without the right precautions, AI can be intellectually harmful, so I would give my students the knowledge they need to stay safe. This would mean giving them a functional knowledge of how to use AI, and the skills to not need it. For any intelligent person, it should be an option, never a necessity.

AI: That's a thoughtful philosophy - AI as an option, never a necessity. Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in educational settings that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that stands out to you?

User: I guess it's worth noting that there's a lot of entertainment value in AI for kids. They love the image generators, and they're creative enough that I don't see them getting bored of it easily! I think an AI-based educational game program would be really great for use in schools.

AI: That's a really interesting observation about the entertainment value and their creativity with image generators. The idea of AI-based educational games sounds like it could tap into that natural engagement they have with the technology.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in educational settings. I particularly appreciated your perspective on teaching students to use AI as an option rather than a necessity, and your observations about how different teachers are navigating these tools.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
