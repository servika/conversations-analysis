Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Ok. Go ahead

AI: Great, thank you. Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I generally use it to collate information from running races and events. I also use it when I'm writing the newspaper article for our running club - I write the week's events from the club and send it to our local paper and they include it; I use it to ensure flow and good phrasing - basically polishing. I also use it to plan trips, normally around running, hiking or even enjoyable dog walks - normally the logistics, things to see and do etc. I sometimes use it to edit and refine social media posts for our running club social pages.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of uses, all centered around your running club activities. 

When you're collating information from races and events, what does that process typically look like? Are you gathering results, participant feedback, or something else entirely?

User: Race results, handicap results, normally rated quickest to slowest time, also things like ladies and men's times, top finishers, and also age category for men and women.

AI: I see, so you're organizing quite a bit of data around performance metrics and demographics.

When you're working with all those race results and creating those different breakdowns - quickest times, age categories, gender splits - do you find yourself collaborating with the AI throughout that process, or do you typically give it all the raw data and let it handle the sorting and organizing on its own?

User: A bit of both, I find that if I don't collaborate there can be errors, especially when asking for information to be presented a certain way.

AI: That makes sense - you've learned that staying involved helps catch those errors. 

Can you walk me through what those errors typically look like? When you say the AI might present information incorrectly if you don't collaborate, what kinds of mistakes does it tend to make?

User: When the handicap race is held, the results are recorded as: runner names, finish time (total time after the timer starts and the first and slowest runners set off), handicap time (minutes runner sets off after the timer and first/slowest runners start), nett time (time it takes each individual runner to run the course) and two other categories are captured: date and PB (personal best time on that course) - I don't always provide these last two.            Errors that occur are typically runner names and times being mixed up, being sorted in a certain order e.g. fastest nett time, men only in fastest time, highlighting PB for that month; another annoying one is when the AI states a runner had a PB for that month even though it may have been years ago! Even when stating clearly how I want the info presented I have to thoroughly check it's correct

AI: That's a really detailed example - thank you. It sounds like those mix-ups with names and times, or incorrectly identifying when someone achieved a personal best, could be pretty significant errors for your club members.

When you catch these mistakes, what's your typical approach to fixing them? Do you point out the specific errors to the AI and ask it to correct them, or do you find it easier to just make the corrections yourself?

User: half and half, sometimes it's layers of errors and it's just quicker to do it myself.

AI: That's a practical approach - knowing when to cut your losses and just handle it directly.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several different tasks - the race results, newspaper articles, trip planning, social media posts. Are there certain tasks in that mix you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I prefer to do social media posts as the emojis can get a bit crazy with AI and if I ask for them toned down they are then on the opposite extreme and are dull

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like finding that middle ground with tone and style for social media can be tricky with AI.

Beyond social media posts, are there other aspects of your running club work where you feel like your personal touch is important, or where you prefer to maintain control even if AI could technically assist?

User: Runners are very passionate about their performances and they love to be recognised so it's important that a personal touch is there, when I do write ups and get them polished up (e.g. write this better..... I want to say they did this/managed this/overcame this.....) AI often goes over board and it's too cheesy so it's a few messages later til it's right. I do use it for this though as sometimes I'm trying to phrase something with a balance of personability, accuracy of terminology, warmth and also so it doesn't seem I'm favouring one particular athlete.

AI: That balance you're describing sounds quite nuanced - capturing the runners' passion while staying accurate and fair to everyone. 

When you're going through those back-and-forth exchanges to get the tone just right, what does that process feel like for you? Is it more like having a collaborative conversation, or does it feel more like you're training the AI to understand what you want?

User: I would say 70% of time I'm training AI

AI: That's really telling - so most of the time you feel like you're in a teaching role rather than working with a partner.

Can you share a time when using AI for your running club work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was planning an abroad trip over winter for some winter sun, where a group could go to a parkrun on saturday, then a trail race on sunday. I asked for some suggestions of parkruns/races and locations that would fit this criteria and specified in europe. The list provided included major hallucinations and untruthful info. I knew immediately as Spain and France don't have parkrun but they appeared on the list. When I said this, a new list with less spanish and no france ideas were suggested but obviously they were false as the parkruns didn't exist - the names were completely made up too! very frustrating and when I said this isn't accurate and why, a sarcastic response from AI followed!

AI: Wow, that sounds incredibly frustrating - not only were the suggestions completely wrong, but then to get a sarcastic response when you pointed out the errors! 

What did you do after that interaction? Did you abandon using AI for that trip planning task, or did you try a different approach with it?

User: I abandoned for that day. I have periodically asked for certain aspects of what I want but omitted the parkrun aspect e.g. asked for trail races in Nov 2025 in Italy, Switzerland etc. Basically I've been more specific with some aspects

AI: That makes sense - you've adapted by breaking it down into smaller, more specific pieces where you can better verify the accuracy.

How have your colleagues or your running club community influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they know you're using it, and if so, what are their thoughts about it?

User: Some people use AI for images for social media, particularly caricatures of athletes which is fun and well received (if not a bit creepy!), personally I don't do this but it adds a good talking point for posts which people seem to like. Certain people know I use AI to collate and refine work, they can't tell I do from posts/articles etc. though as I make sure it doesn't seem like AI and has my personality and writing style as the main element. Older people in the club don't get it, but the mid age and younger people do.

AI: It sounds like there's quite a generational split in how people perceive AI use in the club. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? For instance, with writing those newspaper articles or organizing race data - is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes I do consider it all the time. I try and maintain my skills by reading and studying, listening to podcasts that help develop skills, recognising fantastic writing and why. AI could easily take over but they can't reflect and fully capture the human side of people racing, knowing what it takes to train and race in gruelling conditions and even the tittle tattle that goes on between rivals and clubs. You have to live it to know it. AI can't ever understand falling during a fell race, the little traditions you have as runner, why people run in memory of others and the emotions involved.

AI: That's beautifully put - you're describing something really fundamental about lived experience that can't be replicated. The emotional depth and those subtle community dynamics you mention seem central to what makes your work meaningful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology improves, or do you think you'll continue using it in roughly the same way?

User: I would like to use AI more if it can be accurate but that is a major issue right now. AI can copy and paste info from wiki and studies no problem but given raw data presents problems. I would to be able to learn how it can help more rather than being limited by what I know to not utilise all it's capabilities.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the irreplaceable human elements in your running club work - that understanding of what it means to train, race, and be part of that community.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your running club work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that's all.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining that essential human touch - especially around accuracy with data and capturing the real spirit of your running community - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and the frustrations. Take care!
