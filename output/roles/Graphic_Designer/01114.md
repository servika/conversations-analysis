Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I'm ready.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a contract-based graphic designer who specializes in preparing projects to print. Typically, I produce a lot of promotional material for my clients, which includes some small projects like business cards or flyers, but also cohesive suites of materials (think business cards + forms, flyers, banners, etc.). I've even delved into website creation, script treatments, and more based on what clients need and what I can provide. A client will contact me, give me an idea of what they want, and generally give me free rein over how it gets made; then we hammer out changes.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of work - from print materials to websites and even script treatments. It sounds like you get quite a bit of creative freedom in how you approach each project.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I'm in my thirties, so old enough to be wary of AI's current limitations, but also of the generation that understands that computers—and now, AI—are just another set of tools, just like Photoshop and Wacom tablets. There was pushback when these things became available to artists and designers, now people pay plenty for a good digital artist. In my case, I have used AI for my graphic design work sparingly, occasionally to make mockups of things that I want to produce with greater skill or specific sizing/layouts, but generally as a timesaver for rote tasks. For example, recently I asked if a client had a copy of his business logo, preferably on a business card, so I could take it and make it "camera ready." He had it on a shirt with a gray background. In Photoshop, this can be as easy as selecting a color range and knocking back the background or isolating the solid-color logo, but then you have to account for warp and any artifacts around the edges of it, which can be a pain to clean up. I used an AI tool  to extract this logo for me, and it did well, but wasn't perfect. It claimed to give me a transparent background, even threw in the gray-and-white checkerboard, but I still had to go in and separate the logo. Still, it saved some time; the edges were very clean and it took care of about 70% of the warping, so I killed the background and tweaked the warped text so I could use the logo.

AI: That's a really practical example - using AI as a time-saving tool for those tedious technical tasks rather than for the creative concept itself. It sounds like you approached it with realistic expectations too, knowing you'd still need to do some manual cleanup.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Another project I did was of a more personal nature. A colleague of my mother's had some photos from her niece's wedding that were, sadly, not terribly professional, but a relative did them for free. She remembered that I designed a banner for the store's manager who had died the previous year. There were no photos of the niece and her grandparents together, just in separate photos, and interestingly, there was a person in the main group photo to be edited that was wearing an oversized, neon orange shirt that completely overtook the bride. But the best photos of the grandparents had red eye and they weren't smiling. I was able to use AI to composite some "good" grandparents together, then in Photoshop I pasted everyone in, moved some people around in front of T-shirt guy (he was tall), toned down said shirt, then ran a copy of it through an AI tool to smooth some things out, then checked everything back over in PS to ensure it looked realistic, no floating hands, etc.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful and complex project - helping create a meaningful family photo when the original shots weren't quite working. It's interesting how you used AI at multiple points in that workflow - for compositing the grandparents and then for smoothing things out later.

When you're working with AI like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: In that case, I am. The AI is just doing the things I'd rather not do, like poring over pixels of trees to ensure everyone is blended just so, or cleaning up scratches in photo restorations. I'm playing supervisor to some extent. I have used AI for complete creative output for things like, say, when a relative wants a logo for their business that looks very "painterly"—not my forte, but they are also less aware of what is AI-generated, so a good AI output plus some touchups in Photoshop means that I don't have to expend as much effort for projects that are either unpaid or involve multiple changes if the "client" doesn't know what they want.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - you're clearly making strategic decisions about when and how to deploy AI based on both the project requirements and the client relationship. It sounds like you maintain creative control throughout, using AI more as an efficient assistant for specific tasks.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I have been able to spend more time either working on the broad strokes of a project or researching things to draw from. Taking care of drudge work so I can find the right font, the right color palette, etc. Of course, I imagine that an AI assistant, especially the modern ones, can be a better sounding board now, since many can parse images. Now that assistants are becoming more conversational, it's easier to find those connections or "tip of my tongue" ideas that you can't immediately name. It used to be that failing to remember the name of that one actor in that one flick used to keep a person up at night. Even some Google searches weren't helpful if you didn't have specific enough info. Now, many AI assistants are able to piece it together. Some people argue that there is too much reliance on AI, allowing it to supplant critical thinking, but like many things, if you use it responsibly, there's little harm done.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction - using AI to handle the routine tasks so you can focus more energy on the higher-level creative decisions like typography and color choices. And that "tip of the tongue" research capability sounds really valuable for a designer who needs to pull from such a wide range of references.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Many artists are concerned about their images being used to train AI, essentially allowing it to create works that use their style without attribution. It makes it harder to convince people to pay for commissioned work when they can just upload an image and ask it to make something that looks like that with their changes. That, and as I wrote previously, there are some who do take what AI says as gospel and they fail to fact-check or inspect the output for mistakes. These are things that a client wouldn't accept from a paid professional, and it's concerning to see where some companies "cheap out." If they do it in their public-facing materials, where else are they cutting corners?

AI: Those are really legitimate concerns - both the attribution/training data issue and the broader implications when AI output isn't properly vetted. It sounds like you're seeing this play out directly in how some potential clients approach projects.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would hope that it would evolve to become more sophisticated over the years, involving less back and forth (as the wedding photos) and being able to give me "parts" that I can use to assemble a whole—isolate these people and make the shadows come from the other side, extract this text, generate a sunset with clouds shaped like hearts, but not too "clean," then I could just focus on making it look natural. I'm sure some people have made AI make proportions and compositions look pleasing to the human eye, especially for images that are meant to appear candid or not dead center, but it's not too different to studio photography in that aspect. Your assistant may gather the backdrops, adjust lighting, and provide props, and you do the final posing and click the shutter. Then back and forth between the assistant and you to color-correct and remove flaws.

AI: That's a really compelling vision - AI as a sophisticated creative assistant that can handle specific technical tasks while you orchestrate the overall composition and aesthetic. The photography studio analogy is particularly apt - having an assistant who can handle the setup work so you can focus on the creative direction and final execution.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your practical perspective on using AI strategically - knowing when it's the right tool for the job and maintaining realistic expectations about its capabilities while keeping creative control in your hands.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic tool while maintaining creative control, and your perspective on the evolving relationship between AI capabilities and professional creative work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the practical benefits and the legitimate concerns in your field. Have a great rest of your day!

User: :)

AI: :) Take care!
