Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a game developer/designer. I have been using AI to create things ranging from concept art, 2D graphics that can be used in game such as UI elements, sprites, textures, etc. I also you AI for image to 3D or text to 3D to rapidly create 3D assets that can be used in game. I have also been experimenting with audio AIs to generate music, sound effects, and voices for dialog.

AI: That's fascinating - you're really exploring AI across so many different aspects of game development. It sounds like you're using it throughout the entire creative pipeline.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Since I am mostly a software engineer and not really a creative person, I have add AI into all aspects of the creative process. From brainstorming ideas and having AI create concept art, to generating assets that will be used in game as is, or generating assets that will serve as the bases for a game ready asset that will be taken into something like photoshop of blender for touch up. I have also used it for placeholder art throughout the development process. This gives me a rough Idea of how I imagine the final product looking. Usually my process looks like this. For example, I have an idea for a character. I will create some prompts to generate a character based on what I am looking for. I will iterate on the character in terms of overall appearance and graphic styling. If this is to be a 3D character, I will then bring that image into an image to 3D AI model . From there, the model will be brought into blender for cleaning up and getting it ready to use in game. The process is similar for 2D items but instead of bring it into blender, I will uses something like photoshop to prepare it. I am mostly using local AIs through ComfyUI as well as some online ones like ChatGPT.

AI: That's a really comprehensive workflow you've developed. I can see how AI is helping you bridge that gap between your software engineering background and the creative assets you need for your games.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: On of my current projects is a laid back casual game. My intention for the graphics were to have them cute and 3D with a cartoony vibe. I used chat gpt to generate images for the characters and objects that will appear in the game. I prompted it to generate an image that is cartoony and 3D with a description of the object or character. When I get an image that I think can work, I either use chatgpt or some other local AIs to generate images for multiple angles of the object. I then take those images and put them in HunYuan3D multiview to generate the 3D model with textures. It is then taken into blender to clean up the mesh and textures, rig the and animate the model if needed. It felt both amazing and frustrating using AI for this as when it works, it is absolutely amazing. However, the realty  is that there is often inconsistencies and unwanted artifacts that appear. This can actually cause a lot of wasted time trying to fix this issues. So right now I would say it is a balancing act. Yes, it can greatly increase the time to create an asset but there is also the potential for it to take longer. With repeated prompts and retries to get a decent base as well as the time taken to fix it up, it can sometimes be faster to just create it from scratch.

AI: That's such an honest perspective - the tension between the amazing potential and the practical frustrations. It sounds like you're experiencing both the magic and the messy reality of working with AI.

When you're in those moments where it's working well versus when you're dealing with inconsistencies and artifacts, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions?

User: When it works well, it almost feels like the AI is able to read my mind and produce exactly or very near exactly what I am looking for. When this happens it does feel extremely collaborative as request for modification often get me closer to what I wanted. However, when it doesn't work well, it fells like there is a wall between me and the AI where it just can not understand what I am saying no matter what. For example, it could be as bad as asking to change the color of something and it completely failing. At that point it does not feel collaborative as no matter what I try, the results are often poor. When this happens I do one of 2 things. 1) Walk away for a while, or 2) Try a combination of either a fresh  new chat to start the process over or try a different AI model and see if I can make progress there.

AI: That's a really vivid way to describe it - from mind-reading collaboration to hitting a wall. It sounds like there's almost a communication breakdown that happens sometimes.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Since I was never really an artist, before AI I would have to open something like photoshop or blender and start trying to create the assets from scratch. Since I am not the most creative person when it comes to art, the results were often not great or anything close to what I wanted. With AI, there are 2 ways that this has greatly changed my work. The most obvious is that it can just generate an asset for me based on my description. But also, I have used it to generate a concept image that I can then take into blender and start modeling from scratch with the concept image as a reference. This has allowed me to get much closer to what I was trying to achieve than attempting to do it all on my own.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI has become both a direct asset generator and a creative partner that helps you visualize your ideas. You mentioned you're not naturally inclined toward art, but now you're able to create games with a specific visual style you're aiming for.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: There are 2 main concerns that I have. The first is that talented people will lose their jobs once AI can create production ready assets with a few prompts. The other is backlash from users if they know that AI was used to create some of the assets.

AI: Those are really significant concerns - both the economic impact on artists and the potential reception from players. The job displacement concern is something many creative professionals are grappling with right now.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Currently, there seems to be an AI for nearly if not all aspect of creating games. There are LLM that can write code, AIs that can generate image, 3D models, sound effect, audio, music, voice acting, etc. I have used an AI model in some form for all aspect of this. Some of them so new that I was just experimenting with them and not really using them in my work flow yet. Across all the different AIs I have used, the quality of the output greatly varies. For example, image generation is getting extremely good. A few prompts and you can have exactly what you are looking for and it looks great. However,  3D model and audio generation can often leave a lot to desire. I think over the next few years, we will start seeing more consistent results coming out of some of these newer AIs that don't produce the same level of results. I don't think we will be at a point where a single prompt will output and game ready asset that can just be dropped in within the next few years but I think we will be a lot closer. I would also like to see better integration into tools that I use.

AI: You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in game development. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has transformed your ability to bridge the gap between your engineering skills and the creative vision you have for your games, and your honest assessment of both the collaborative highs and the frustrating lows.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I have nothing else

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of integrating AI across the entire game development pipeline - from the mind-reading collaboration moments to the communication walls, and your balanced perspective on both the potential and the current limitations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's clear you're really at the forefront of experimenting with these tools, and your honest take on everything from workflow integration to concerns about job displacement and player reception gives us a lot to think about. Thanks again for participating!
