Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I work as a chef so a lot of my job is creating or finding new recipes/adapting them so that people with food allergy or intolerances can eat them, like making dairy-free versions etc. I work in the UK and have found that there's a lot of good US recipes, specifically for gluten-free food, so when I find recipes they tend to use US measurements but I prefer to use UK measurements. I found that getting an AI to do the conversions of whole recipes saves so much time, as I used to just google the conversion of each measurement one by one.

AI: That's fascinating - so you're using AI to bridge that gap between US and UK recipe formats while you're adapting recipes for dietary restrictions. 

When you have AI convert those measurements, how does that typically work? Do you paste in the whole recipe and ask for conversion, or is there a particular way you've found works best for getting accurate results?

User: I tend to ask the model to convert these measurements into ml and grams and then copy in a list of the ingredients and measurements straight from the original recipe. I have found sometimes that copying in the whole recipe e.g. the step-by-step instructions as well as ingredient list can sometimes confuse the model and it will give me two different answers for the same measurement. That's why I just copying in the ingredient list now.

AI: That's really insightful - you've clearly learned through trial and error what gets you the most reliable results. So you discovered that too much context can actually throw off the accuracy.

When the AI does give you those conflicting measurements for the same ingredient, how do you handle that? Do you double-check the conversions yourself, or have you developed other ways to catch those inconsistencies?

User: Sometimes I will just ask it to clarify in a separate turn, so that it has less information to deal with, but most of the time it's easier to just double check myself. The majority of the time its pretty obvious when it's made a mistake. For example, the recipe will call for an equal amount of flour and butter, so this is easy to spot when it gives me two totally different answers. Also, as I've been doing this for a while, I can have a general idea of what a conversion would be, I'm just looking for specifics.

AI: That makes perfect sense - your expertise as a chef gives you that intuitive sense when something's off, even if you want the precise conversions.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your recipe development process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: So I have experimented with getting the AI to make a recipe fit for a certain dietary requirement e.g. giving it a regular brownie recipe and asking it to make it gluten-free. However, I have found that the model can make mistakes here, and as it is working with dietary requirements, this is a more dangerous mistake to make than simply converting a measurement wrong. For example, I wanted a gluten free noodle recipe but the model still used soy sauce in the recipe, but most soy sauces are not gluten-free. As the recipe didn't specify "gluten-free soy sauce" I had to edit this before passing it on to my junior chefs. While they may have known to use gluten-free soy sauce, they are still learning so it was a potential hazard to not specify this. Therefore, I tend to not reply on AI for tasks like this.

AI: That's a really important distinction you've drawn - the safety implications make those adaptation tasks much higher stakes than measurement conversions. It sounds like you've learned to be quite strategic about where the risks are acceptable.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I used to be a little more collaborative, like changing recipes together. But more recently I use it more to delegate tasks which, like you said, are lower risk and wouldn't cause serious harm if the AI got something wrong. A lot of the time, when using AI for recipe creation/changing, I find I have to be collaborative with the models whether I want to or not, as I don't 100% trust it to get these types of task right by itself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful evolution - it sounds like you've moved toward more delegation as you've identified where AI is most reliable, but recipe adaptation still pulls you back into that collaborative mode because the stakes demand your oversight.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have other chefs or your team had any reactions to you incorporating these tools?

User: I  actually encourage the junior staff to use AI in the same way for measurement conversion. It's just so much quicker as long as the models gets it right and they love that cos they get a break 5 minutes quicker. It also works as a teaching tool in that regard, as it makes them look out for mistakes or something that doesn't seem right ratio-wise and they learn to question this as well as what typical ratios would look like in recipes. I have actively discouraged the use of AI to create recipes  though due to the reasons we discussed, as they have slightly less experience in this regard.

AI: That's really interesting how you've turned it into both a time-saver and a learning opportunity - teaching them to spot inconsistencies while giving them that efficiency boost.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Definitely the soy sauce fiasco I described earlier made me a little frustrated as again that can cause some damage if I didn't spot it.  But I do remember one day when we were doing a function and the organisers actually emailed me a list of 10+ recipes all in US measurements so being able to get AI to do  all those conversions genuinely save me so much time so that was great.

AI: That function example really illustrates the power of AI when it's in its sweet spot - handling that volume of conversions would have been such a tedious manual task.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given your role training junior chefs?

User: Honestly, it really made my brush up on my allergen training, which I already had but I wanted to make sure I knew as much as I could and was as up to date on that as possible, as well as making sure the juniors had the same level of training. I think that in the conversion area, AI has actually helped me learn somethings as before I never bothered to actually learn, I'd just google the conversion and not take anything in. But when I get the AI to do it, it's so much easier to see the comparisons.

AI: That's a fascinating insight - AI actually strengthened your expertise rather than replacing it. You became more vigilant about allergen knowledge and inadvertently learned more about conversions by seeing them in context.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I would love to get to a point where we can trust AI to create recipes that cater for dietary requirements as I think this would actually allow for more creativity in this area. It's fun to be able to find a base for , say a vegan cupcake, and use that base to build upon to create your own recipe.

AI: That vision of AI as a creative springboard is really compelling - having it handle the foundational adaptation work so you can focus on the innovative touches that make recipes your own.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've developed such clear boundaries around where AI fits safely into your workflow, and how you've turned it into a teaching tool for your junior staff.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's everything

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating safety considerations, developing trust boundaries, and even turning AI tools into learning opportunities will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've thoughtfully integrated AI into your work while maintaining the expertise and oversight that keeps your kitchen running safely. Thanks again for participating!
