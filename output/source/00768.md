Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for idea generation and creativity. I am a baker so sometimes I have a hard time figuring out new flavor combination or variety ideas.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI to spark creativity in baking is such an interesting application. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're looking for new flavor combinations, how do you typically interact with AI to generate those ideas?

User: I'll usually have one ingredient that I know I want to include, and I want ideas on other ingredients that will work well with it. For example, I would ask--"I am making muffins with dried pineapple. What other flavors or inclusions would work with this?"

AI: That makes a lot of sense - starting with one anchor ingredient and building from there. 

When AI gives you those flavor pairing suggestions, what happens next? Do you typically take the ideas and run with them on your own, or do you continue working with AI throughout the recipe development process?

User: I typically run with the ideas on my own, as we already have set recipes that don't need much adjustment.

AI: So you're using AI more as an initial creative spark rather than for the technical recipe work itself. That's really interesting.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your baking work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I think when it comes to the actual recipes, those are like scientific formulas that I don't fully trust AI to really understand. I don't fully trust that AI yet understands the science of baking and how exact it sometimes has to be. However, I do ask AI questions if I make mistakes and how it could potentially effect the recipe. For example--I made a batch of cookies that normally takes 24 eggs, but I accidentally only put in 18 eggs, so I asked how it would effect the outcome.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - trusting AI for troubleshooting but not for the precise formulation work. 

When you asked about the missing eggs in your cookie batch, how did that interaction go? Did AI give you useful guidance on what to expect from that mistake?

User: Yes, the response AI had to my egg mistake was assuring. the AI let me know that the cookies may come out slightly denser or dry, and perhaps to slightly under bake them. It was accurate advice and made me feel better about the mistake because AI let me know it wouldn't make a huge impact on the batch overall.

AI: That sounds like it was genuinely helpful and reassuring when you needed it. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your baking work? Do other bakers you work with have similar approaches, or have you noticed different attitudes toward using AI?

User: I believe I am the only person in my kitchen that using AI on a semi-regular basis. My colleagues are a bit more skeptical than I am, I think.

AI: That's interesting that you're kind of pioneering the use of AI in your kitchen. 

What do you think makes you more open to using it compared to your colleagues? And does being the only one using it regularly affect how you approach it at all?

User: I think I'm more open to using it because I am more used to it and have used it in various different settings. I just don't think they have as much experience with it. And yeah, I usually do my AI research a bit more in private and not out in the open kitchen, as I'm not sure how they would feel about me using it for ideas, but I find it helpful.

AI: That's really revealing - you're doing your AI research privately because you're not sure how your colleagues would react. 

Can you share a time when using AI for your baking work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't think I've come across anything noticeably frustrating in this area. It's usually quite satisfying to ask AI about flavor combinations simply because it reminds me of other flavors that I haven't used in a while, as it's hard for me to remember all the possibilities.

AI: That's a nice way to think about it - AI as a memory aid for all the flavor possibilities you already know but might forget about.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially as AI gets better at understanding things like baking science?

User: I don't really think about it, honestly. I am staying in my lane. I am working to actively enhance my baking skills and learn more complex techniques. I am not worried about AI potentially taking over my role one day--I don't think it's possible. I see AI as a collaborator in my work, and not something that could potentially "take over" my work.

AI: That's a refreshingly confident perspective - seeing AI as a collaborator rather than a threat. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI in your baking work evolving? Do you think you'll expand how you use it, or do you see it staying pretty much in the creative brainstorming role it plays now?

User: as AI expands and becomes "smarter," I will likely ease into asking more complex baking questions. Or, if I get the chance to develop and create my own recipes, I will likely ask for advice from AI. I also want to start asking AI more about creative names for various projects, as those are difficult to come up with too.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in baking. I particularly appreciated your perspective on seeing AI as a collaborator rather than a threat, and how you're using it as a creative memory aid for flavor combinations while maintaining clear boundaries around the technical aspects you want to control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your baking work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think that's it! Happy I could help.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative partner while maintaining expertise in the technical aspects of baking will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really interesting to hear how you've found your own comfortable way to integrate AI into your work, even in an environment where others might be more skeptical. Thanks again for participating!
