Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions at this time.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a freelance writer. I have written articles for online blogs, short magazine articles, and newspaper articles. I have also written many children's stories and published poems. My articles typically revolve around families or traveling with children from the ages of newborn to high school. My most typical projects lately are short stories and poems. I typically find my work online and adjust my writing to what is needed. My turn around time is typically 24-48 hours from the time I accept a job.

AI: That's a really diverse portfolio of writing work! It sounds like you're juggling quite a variety of formats and topics, especially with that quick turnaround time.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I do not like to be repetitive in my professional writing but often have trouble coming up with names for characters. I have used AI to help with that, as well as to give me a quick backstory for a character I'm considering writing into my story. It is faster for me to have the AI do the backstory than for me to come up with all of the details on my own if I am under time constraints. I never use it to write the story. I love the personal creativity of writing but when the clock is ticking down I do like to use it as a helper.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI very strategically for specific elements rather than the actual writing itself. You mentioned using it for character names and backstories when you're under time pressure.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was tasked with writing a short story for 7-8 year old children. I was hired by a school principal (also an acquaintance) that wanted something special for a class that was off to a bit of a rocky start with their school year. Their original teacher was only there for 2 days before leaving without notice. He had me write a story about sudden changes and resilience when things are a bit scary and uncertain. I bounced some ideas around with AI and had it help me create backstories for 3 of the main characters. I was struggling to explain to the kids in their own terms why a teacher might leave... or in this case, why a hedgehog needed to spread it's wings and that even when unexpected things happen, it can sometimes be a good thing.

AI: What a thoughtful project - helping children process that kind of uncertainty through storytelling. It sounds like you were working through some complex emotional territory there.

When you were bouncing ideas around with AI and developing those backstories, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what was driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I was definitely driving the conversation. I had an idea of what I wanted it to look like so I put in the basic premise of the story and a few of the characters I knew I wanted to have. I asked for help with backstories for the main characters so I could give them some depth. I specifically asked what from their past could contribute to the strong feelings they were having and how might they work past it.

AI: That really shows how you maintained creative control while using AI as a tool for specific elements. It sounds like you had a clear vision and were directing the AI to help flesh out particular aspects.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I believe that AI has helped me to really give my characters so much more depth than what I was previously able to. I always gave them a bit of backstory, but looking back, I realize that it was more of something I felt I had to do and I did the bare basics. Now when someone reads my stories, I hope that they can picture every last detail of the character that they are reading about. I have also used it to help hone in on emotions that my character may be feeling and how they might react if that emotion is very strong in the moment.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has actually elevated the depth and richness of your character development in ways you hadn't achieved before. You mentioned that previously backstories felt more like something you "had to do" but now you're creating much more vivid, detailed characters.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm so concerned that publishers will turn to AI as a cheap way to mass produce stories that are not actually written by real people. I worry that the younger kids will lose their imaginations because "AI can do it all for them." I worry that we'll lose a bit of our humanity if we let machines take over the artistic side of us. We NEED that in order to survive and to keep hope and peace in the world. I don't believe that machines will ever be able to capture stories the way the human soul does. It can use the right words to evoke some strong emotions, but that special little something is missing if it doesn't come from a beating heart.

AI: Those are really profound concerns about preserving what makes human creativity essential. The way you describe that "special little something" that comes from "a beating heart" - that's such a powerful way to articulate what feels uniquely human about storytelling.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I sadly see it taking over more than it should. I think people will get lazy and let the AI do the work for them. I also think there will be groups of "purists" who will fight it with everything they have in them to keep the true creativity alive. I can see online articles and magazines taking the easy, and cheaper way out and using AI to create content instead of paying people.

AI: You've painted a really vivid picture of this potential divide between efficiency-driven automation and those fighting to preserve authentic human creativity. It sounds like you see yourself as someone who will continue to use AI strategically while protecting the core creative elements.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has enhanced your character development while you maintain such strong boundaries around preserving the human heart of storytelling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I believe that is all for now.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic tool for character development while fiercely protecting the human soul of storytelling will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated how clearly you articulated both the practical benefits you've found and your deeper concerns about preserving what makes human creativity irreplaceable. That perspective is invaluable.

Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your writing projects!
