Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I work as an R and D associaate, and I often use AI to brainstorm ideas for formulations or to analyze data, or find releveant research information or articles

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI touches several different aspects of your R&D work. 

When you say you use it to brainstorm ideas for formulations, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like?

User: unfortuantely the exact details are under an NDA, but I can say that I use it to hyoothetically explore what would happen if i combine certain oligomers together, as a sort of hypothesis before i actually perform the experimental trial

AI: That makes perfect sense about the NDA - I appreciate you sharing what you can. 

So it sounds like you're using AI as a kind of theoretical testing ground before you move to actual experiments. When you're exploring these hypothetical combinations, how do you find yourself working with the AI? Are you going back and forth with questions and refinements, or do you typically give it a scenario and let it work through the possibilities?

User: usually i have one specific question to ask it, like "given these two chemicals, what are their deifferences in the physical properties"

AI: Interesting - so you're using it more for targeted, specific queries rather than open-ended brainstorming sessions.

When you get those answers about physical property differences, what do you typically do with that information? Does it influence your decision about whether to proceed with an experiment, or does it serve a different purpose in your workflow?

User: i kinda use it to see if it matches with my own hypothesis, and often times it doesnt. i dont think it influences what i will proceed with, since experimental data is still valuable and i cant fully trus the ai yet.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using it as a check against your own thinking rather than as the deciding factor. 

You mentioned you can't fully trust the AI yet. Tell me more about that - what would need to change for you to feel more confident in relying on its input for your experimental decisions?

User: well, im not sure it can ever be fully correct with how chemical composition affects physical porpoerties, sincwe i think thast an ongoing field of research. if it was constantly updated with information, that might make me feel better, but i think the overarching premose of r and d being developing things that dont exist yet kinda force the ai into a more limited role

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the idea that R&D by nature involves exploring uncharted territory where AI's training might inherently fall short.

Given that limitation, are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks feel like they should stay in your hands?

User: i mean, ultimately i do like to make the final decisions regarding which formulations are better myself. otherwise it feels like im using ai to *do* my job, ratehr than being an assistant

AI: That distinction is really compelling - AI as an assistant versus doing the job itself. 

When you think about that line between assistance and replacement, what does it feel like when you're on the right side of it? Can you describe what it's like when AI is functioning well as your assistant?

User: I feel like im on the right side of that line when it feels like im coming up with the majority of ideas and using ai to check,, rather than vice cersa

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining your role as the primary idea generator while using AI for validation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that people around you have similar approaches, or are there different philosophies about how to integrate it?

User: My manager often uses ai for the same purpose, and some of my collegaues have used ai to attempt to create a program that will predict relevant parameters for their 3d printer validation wrk. i think we all have a similar minde=set about ai though, although i tink im more skepitical of ai than  the otehrs

AI: Interesting that you see yourself as more skeptical than your colleagues. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't think ai has ever made me feel *parituclarly* satisified or frustrate, given the small role i tend to let it play

AI: That's telling in itself - that AI hasn't created strong emotional reactions because of how you've positioned it in your work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do not actvely consider this, since i think my main role is more hands on chemistry type, and physical ai is not quite fully fledged an commericalidez yet

AI: That's an interesting point about physical AI not being commercialized yet for hands-on chemistry work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops, or do you think you'll maintain this current approach?

User: I think I will maintain this current approach until AI is correct mearly 100% of the time

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that boundary between AI as an assistant versus doing your job, and how the inherently exploratory nature of R&D limits AI's role.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no im good

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a validation tool rather than a decision-maker, and how the exploratory nature of R&D work naturally limits AI's role, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
