Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a science teacher, so I mainly use it for a few things. First, I use it to reword emails to parents and report card comments so that they sound more professional, because I can be a bit blunt and too honest. Second, I use it to generate ideas for labs or projects. Third, I use it to generate content, like bell-ringers, worksheets, or study guides. Fourth, I will use it to help my own understanding in topics I'm not familiar with (for example, I'm a physics person who got stuck teaching biology one year, so I use it to check answers). Fifth, I'll use it to convert tests that were random question styles to all multiple choice, for a final exam.

AI: That's a really comprehensive list - it sounds like AI touches quite a few different aspects of your teaching work. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I generally prefer to make and grade summative assessments myself. I prefer to make them myself so that I can ensure they're being tested on everything I've taught them and to the difficulty I'd like. I prefer to grade them myself so that I have a really good idea of where each student has or lacks mastery. I do wish AI could help me grade formative assessments though. What makes summative assessments different is that student performance on them is the best test of whether or not I did my job of teaching well, so seeing students' work and reading their words myself shows me more than if I had an AI grade it.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the idea that summative assessments give you direct feedback on your own teaching effectiveness makes a lot of sense.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually try to delegate tasks for it to complete independently. The only time I interact with it is if it returns something that doesn't quite match my vision of what I had expected, so I will interact with the AI and have it make tweaks until the product is as I envisioned it.

AI: So you start with a clear vision and then work with AI to refine until it matches what you had in mind. That's helpful to understand.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Somewhat. Our admin team is mostly older people, and you can tell that they use AI to do a lot of their work for them - writing most emails they send, writing most of the internal documents for the school. At first I thought they were just really great writers since they're all English teachers or former English teachers, but most of the stuff they produce is clearly AI. That turned me off. For non-creative documents like bare-bones study guides, or for things I genuinely need help with, like writing a somewhat positive report card comment for a bad student, I too rely heavily on AI. But I don't want my voice to become like AI. Anything creative or personally communicative that I write, I want it to sound like me, even if there are awkwardly-worded sentences. Like there's a big difference between using AI for ideas and having it polish your writing, and just having it fully do creative things for you. Since they have it fully do creative things for them, it turns me off from wanting it to do that. I would love to use it more for rote tasks though

AI: That's a really thoughtful reflection on finding the balance between helpful assistance and maintaining your authentic voice. It sounds like seeing your colleagues' approach helped clarify your own boundaries.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It's satisfying for easy but time-consuming tasks. Like I asked it to make me a study guide of essential facts and graphs for the AP Physics 1 exam, and it did it instantly and there was hardly anything I had to add myself. Something that may have taken me at least a half hour, I was able to get done in a few minutes. I got frustrated when asking it to help me map out my Physical Science curriculum to the book The Martian, since it kept messing up the number of chapters that the book had.

AI: That's a great contrast - the study guide sounds like it played perfectly to AI's strengths, while the curriculum mapping ran into some accuracy issues with basic facts about the book.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think AI could actively take over the "teaching" role by introducing and explaining concepts, drilling students on info or with problems, and then explaining where they went wrong. That would also allow students to work at their own pace, and with that one-on-one interaction with students it could take over the teacher's role of differentiating instruction MUCH more effectively than any teacher really can. Then, I see a teacher's role as being more of a facilitator, problem-solver, and encourager to students, and maybe focusing more on hands-on stuff.

AI: That's a really forward-thinking perspective on how the teaching role itself might evolve. You seem to see it as shifting toward more of a coaching and facilitating function.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to continue to use it more and more for tasks I see as boring and rote - for example, grading homework or labs.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to maintain your authentic voice and the distinction you made between using AI for assistance versus having it fully take over creative tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Only that AI also poses a problem for teachers in that students tend to try to use it as a substitute for having to think or do creative work for themselves.

AI: That's a really important point - the flip side of AI in education where it creates challenges with student learning and academic integrity. That must add another layer of complexity to your work as you're trying to leverage AI's benefits while also ensuring students are still developing their own thinking skills.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between efficiency and authenticity, and the evolving challenges in education, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
