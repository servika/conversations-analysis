Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, I don't have any questions, go ahead with your questions.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, I'm an artist, I do mostly pixel art for video games.  I use ai mostly for thinking through designs, things like character design, if I'm not sure where I want to go with my idea.  Like if I need a new boss but I'm drawing a blank on fun unique design elements I'll generate a few different suggestions and tweak it till I get something I really like.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI as a creative brainstorming partner for when you hit those design roadblocks. 

Tell me more about that process of tweaking the AI suggestions until you get something you really like. What does that back-and-forth typically look like?

User: Something like, I need a boss monster idea,  Snowy tundra type level, should be very large and detailed,  the hero uses a bow and arrow to attack, I need a clear central target to hit, give me 3 ideas for the character.... then if it gives me something like, a yeti with a big eye.  I might say I like the idea of the yeti, but I want him to be more unique and I don't want the eye to be the target, and get ai to generate some new tweaks to the design.  Make sense?

AI: Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. You're essentially having a design conversation where the AI throws out initial concepts and then you guide it toward what works for your specific needs.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do mostly pixel art which is very precise, I haven't liked the way any image ai software generates pixel art images, I prefer to do the actual creation of the art myself and to only use ai as a brainstorming partner.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - you're keeping the hands-on craft of pixel art for yourself while leveraging AI for the ideation phase. 

When you use AI for that brainstorming, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have that back-and-forth collaboration throughout developing an idea, or do you tend to get what you need from AI and then go off to create independently?

User: definitely back and forth.  I might even come back after I've started a design.  I like the models where you can upload images so I don't have to describe in detail what I want.  keeping with the yeti example, I might start drawing something like... a gem in the middle of his stomach as a target, but then not like the way it looks, I'll upload the image of the character and say that I don't like the way the gem target is looking, and request a few suggestions on other ideas.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI as an ongoing creative consultant throughout your design process, even bringing your work-in-progress back for fresh perspectives when you hit snags.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work mostly independently and just show clients the finished product, or a few in progress images, I don't tell other people that I use ai this way, although the art field as a whole has mixed opinions on ai and they would be considered colleagues in a sense.

AI: That's a really honest response - keeping your AI use private while navigating the broader art community's mixed feelings about it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had a Monster I was designing, I needed to incorporate some very odd different features in it, I was having a very hard time getting them all to work together.  I talked through an ai bot that helped me come up with a more cohesive design that hadn't actually occurred to me on my own.  It was really helpful.  

On the flip side, I've many times seen some pretty repetitive suggestions from ai that do get frustrating.  It has a tendency to suggest the same specific modifications over and over.

AI: That satisfaction of having AI help you see a solution you hadn't considered sounds really valuable - especially for that challenge of integrating multiple odd features cohesively.

And I can imagine how those repetitive suggestions would get frustrating when you're looking for fresh creative input.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Currently, I feel like ai doesn't do well with my specific little niche of pixel art.  But it does worry me some, so many things can be automated with ai.  I think even if it does though, it would still need a human component to drive it to make better art with an artists eye.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - recognizing both the current limitations in your specific medium while acknowledging the broader concerns, but also seeing that human artistic vision as something that would still be essential.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope it continues much like it is, I'd like to see ai get a bit less repetitive, it would be nice if it didn't suggest the same modifications to every character I discuss with it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a creative brainstorming partner while maintaining the hands-on craft aspects that you value, and how you've developed that iterative back-and-forth process including bringing work-in-progress back for fresh input.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope, that is all thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative consultant while preserving the craft elements you're passionate about will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
