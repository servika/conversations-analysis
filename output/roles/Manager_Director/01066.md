Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No I do not, please proceed!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI isn't a massive addition to my workday, however I tend to use it to help with scheduling as well as reviewing and editing projects and emails.

AI: That's interesting - you mention it's not massive but you're using it for some pretty important daily activities like scheduling and communications. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for scheduling. What does that process look like for you?

User: If I have an overly busy day with meetings I have AI review my schedule and provide me with an efficient way to schedule the free time I do have.

AI: That sounds really practical. When AI reviews your schedule and suggests how to use your free time, what kinds of recommendations does it typically give you? 

And how do you decide whether to follow those suggestions or do something different?

User: My daily activities don't tend to stray too far out of a set path and I've used this AI enough I can tell when it recommends things out of the ordinary. I use my best judgment as to whether or not I follow its advice, but day to day activities can change at the drop of a hat.

AI: That's a really insightful point about developing that sense of when AI recommendations feel "off" for your routine. 

You mentioned you also use AI for reviewing and editing projects and emails. Can you walk me through what that looks like - do you write something first and then have AI review it, or is there more back-and-forth collaboration happening?

User: I use it more so as a "tone" check. I've recently been included in higher, managerial level emails and conversations so when my input is required if I feel uneasy about what I'm saying I'll use AI to review and make suggestions to make it better.

AI: That's a really specific and thoughtful use case - using AI as a tone check for higher-stakes communications. 

When you're feeling uneasy about what you've written, what kinds of changes does the AI typically suggest? Are they usually about word choice, structure, or something else entirely?

User: A little bit of both. It'll make notes when something seems like it could come off more professionally, or it'll make suggestions for more educated sounding synonyms.

AI: That makes sense - having that safety net for professional communication sounds valuable, especially when you're navigating new levels of responsibility.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to relegate AI to simple, calculated, or mathematical tasking. I tend to shy away from using AI on more complex issues as it take as long to lay out the parameters as it would to complete it.

AI: That's a really practical distinction - the efficiency trade-off between setting up the parameters versus just doing the work yourself. 

Can you give me an example of a complex issue where you decided it would take too long to explain to AI what you needed? What made that particular task feel like it wasn't worth the setup time?

User: At this time no. I work through multiple proprietary client systems which doesn't allow the use of AI, I tend to use it for personal, small level issues.

AI: Ah, that's an important detail - the proprietary systems constraint really shapes how you can use AI at work. 

So when you mentioned using AI for scheduling and email tone checks, are those happening outside of those proprietary systems? And how do you navigate that boundary between what you can and can't use AI for in your work?

User: There really isn't a rule in place ruling out the use of AI, but its still developmental with our systems. I use it personally for scheduling and emails.

AI: I see - so it sounds like your workplace is still figuring out the AI policies, and you're being thoughtful about where you use it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people talking about it, or is everyone kind of navigating this individually?

User: We'll get newsletters speaking at a very high level of AI, but mostly its individually.

AI: So it sounds like there's some organizational awareness but not much day-to-day discussion among colleagues about how people are actually using it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work - or for work-related tasks - made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Any time you get into a situation in which you feel like you need to be confrontational through email or message, it's incredibly helpful to use AI to reword what you would like to say into something more professional and calm.

AI: That's a powerful example - using AI to help manage those tense moments and find a more professional way to express difficult messages. 

When you get that AI-revised version back, how does it typically change what you originally wrote? Does it feel like it still captures what you really wanted to communicate, or do you find yourself adjusting it further to make it sound more like you?

User: A little. When using AI you're able to express what you really want to say, then use the AI to reword it into something helpful and positive.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI helps you bridge the gap between your raw feelings and professional communication.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Given enough time I believe that AI can take over a large quantity of processing and data analysis, however at this time I do not believe it would be to the point that it threatens my job itself.

AI: That's a balanced perspective - recognizing AI's growing capabilities in data processing while feeling secure about your overall role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as your workplace policies become clearer?

User: I personally feel like AI is going to take over much of the data input and analysis that we all complete semi-manually at this point. At a higher level the data it provides will be used to drive decisions.

AI: That's a thoughtful view of how AI might reshape work - handling more of the data heavy lifting while humans focus on the decision-making.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your measured approach to AI use, especially how you've found it valuable for communication and scheduling while being mindful of workplace boundaries. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a "tone check" for those higher-stakes professional conversations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I appreciate the conversation

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding practical, specific uses for AI while navigating workplace constraints will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
