Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI helps me side-by-side in my coding at work. I work on tasks like making python scripts to automate tasks, yaml scripts to automate server infrastructure tasks, and also do full stack stuff with react/html and javascript. I use github copilot directly in my coding environment, but I also have gemini pro that I use for more complex stuff

AI: That sounds like AI is pretty integrated into your development workflow. When you mention using Copilot directly in your coding environment versus turning to Gemini Pro for more complex stuff - what makes you decide to switch from one to the other?

User: Sometimes copilot seems like it's not as correct in its answers as gemini pro. I enjoy copilot for quick/easier tasks because it directly interacts with your code and implements the changes, allowing you to see what it changes and keep/don't keep them. But gemini pro is overall more correct most of the time

AI: That's interesting - so you're weighing convenience against accuracy. When you say Gemini Pro is "more correct most of the time," what does that look like in practice? Can you walk me through what happens when you take a complex problem to Gemini Pro instead of relying on Copilot?

User: Gemini Pro is usually just more accurate and better at understanding my instructions than copilot from what I've seen. for a more complex problem I can copy/paste certain portions of the code into gemini pro and ask them to focus on that. Also for copilot it's convenient when just providing the files as context and sometimes it gets distracted by irrelevant parts of the code and makes unnecessary changes

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you have different strategies for managing what context each tool sees. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Tasks like organizing notes, coming up with ideas, designing products or anything in general I prefer to do myself. AI can assist, but these are things I enjoy doing and also want to put more effort in, as they do often require a bit more subjective perspective and based on what the team or customer wants.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction. It sounds like you're drawn to keeping the more creative and strategic work for yourself - the things that require that human judgment and understanding of stakeholders.

When you do use AI for your coding tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually have a new feature to add, or remove, or fix. I would come up with a basic idea of how I want to implement it, such as for example using an API from some place and putting it in the backend, adding a route, and connecting it to a frontend with inputs. I would identify which files I want to create in which folders, the structure of my code, such as naming convention of the routes, my variables, etc. and provide this to AI. I would also provide boilerplate code for my basic UI styling of the app, so that it matches the universal style, and ask AI to implement. Then I go over the changes myself and ensure everything is actually correct, making changes myself if I see an implementation I dont like

AI: So you're really the architect of the solution - you're doing the planning and design work, then having AI execute your vision, and then you're the quality control at the end. 

Tell me more about that final review step where you go over the changes. What kinds of things do you typically find yourself adjusting or correcting?

User: It can vary a lot, it could be using different data structures from what I had in mind, using a different UI component from what I had in mind such as dropdown versus selection, or different ways of displaying data

AI: That's helpful - it sounds like even when you give fairly detailed specifications, the AI might interpret implementation details differently than you envisioned.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues use it regularly and I was actually hesitant at first because I wasnt sure how reliable it would be but my colleagues encourage me to use it as AI makes our workflow significantly faster with few mistakes.

AI: That's a nice example of how team culture can shape adoption. You mentioned you were hesitant at first about reliability - what changed your mind? Was there a particular moment or experience that shifted your perspective on AI's reliability?

User: I was just hesitant in general but using it myself and realizing how accurate and effective it can be changed my mind

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time I was very satisfied with AI was when I worked on a yaml playbook to install post configurations on a server build. This was an area I did not have any expertise in and needed a lot of help from others. I was provided a system design and configuration document, but AI really helped me go over all the details and actually create the playbook with the correct tasks, that I was able to verify later with another engineer.

AI: That sounds like a really powerful example - AI helping you bridge a knowledge gap in an area outside your expertise. When you say you were able to verify it later with another engineer, how did that verification process go? Did the AI-generated playbook hold up well under scrutiny?

User: Yes, the playbook was overall correct. It had some errors along the way, such as a few incorrect values that I guess it probably made its own assumptions as it was ambiguous, or the pasting of the document missed some parts. But overall the AI was accurate on the instructions that were clear

AI: That's a great example of how AI can accelerate learning in unfamiliar domains. It sounds like the errors were mostly around ambiguous information rather than fundamental misunderstandings of the technology itself.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes this is something I think about. I try to practice my own skills by working on my own side projects/apps in my downtime on things im more passionate about. This is also something I enjoy doing and don't need AI on, even though it would speed things up. I try to learn new things on my own in my own time, while using AI on the more critical time-sensitive things that it's able to assist me with. I also try to not fully rely on it, making sure to double check everything because I know it can hallucinate or make mistakes

AI: That's a thoughtful balance - using your personal projects as a space for pure skill development while leveraging AI for work efficiency. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision working more with AI in the future, especially as models become more powerful and more accurate. This means AI can be more reliable and I expect that many others will rely on it more due to that

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you strategically choose between different AI tools based on accuracy versus convenience, and how you use personal projects to maintain your core skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope that's all

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with skill development, and how you've developed strategies for choosing the right tool for different tasks, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
