Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sometimes I use it to help me decide the best way to organize data in excel, I also use it to help me with some scientific problems

AI: That's interesting - sounds like you're using AI for both data organization and scientific work. 

Tell me more about the scientific problems you bring to AI. What does that usually look like?

User: For example we perform PCR in our lab, sometimes we get invalid results depending on what we are testing so I ask AI about different potential causes of invalid results.

AI: That makes sense - using AI as a troubleshooting resource for lab work. 

When you run into those invalid PCR results, how do you typically approach working with AI on that? Do you give it all the details about your specific experiment, or do you ask more general questions about PCR troubleshooting?

User: I try not to be too specific, I try to keep it as simple as possible. Sometimes I use my own knowledge to try and narrow down what I think could be potential causes and then use AI to reason what would be most likely

AI: Interesting - so you're using your own expertise to narrow things down first, then bringing AI in to help with the reasoning process. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think I would be open to using AI more but it doesn't always occur to me since I'm so used to doing tasks alone

AI: That's a really honest perspective - the habit of working independently can definitely make it easy to forget AI is an option.

When you do remember to use AI and actually engage with it, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete problem to work on independently?

User: I usually collaborate on a task as I like to have some level of control, I guess I'm also still not entirely sure how capable the AI would be to complete a task independently

AI: That makes sense - wanting to maintain control and being uncertain about AI's independent capabilities. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it, or is it something you've mostly figured out on your own?

User: It's something I've figured out on my own, most of my colleagues are older and don't really have much understanding of AI. Only recently one of them told me he used it to help him with some invoices and he was very surprised at how well it worked. I think they generally don't use it though

AI: So you're kind of pioneering this on your own while your colleagues are just starting to discover what's possible.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was given a large amount of data by my manager to present to the rest of the team in graphs, however there was so much data I found it difficult to find a way of organizing it into graphs that make sense. The data had also been filled into excel in a very chaotic way by someone who doesn't know how to use excel. I asked AI for help with this but it was unable to understand what I needed

AI: That sounds like a really frustrating situation - dealing with messy data and then hitting a wall when AI couldn't grasp what you were trying to accomplish.

What do you think made it difficult for the AI to understand what you needed in that situation? Was it the complexity of the data organization, or something about how you were describing the problem?

User: I'm not sure, I used two different AI models and one of them actually stopped responding entirely

AI: That's really frustrating when the tool just stops working entirely. It sounds like that was a pretty complex data visualization challenge.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes this is something I have to do, however in this case it was such a monumental task to try and go through and reorganize the data I was really hoping this would be a perfect challenge for AI. I think the models probably found it difficult to understand how my colleague had entered the data

AI: That makes perfect sense - it sounds like you were dealing with data that was so poorly organized that even describing it clearly to AI became nearly impossible.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, or in different ways?

User: Yes definitely, I find it a very useful tool. Sometimes I like to just ask it questions or give it tasks to see how well it performs and to help me understand more ways I can use it

AI: That's a great approach - experimenting with it to discover new possibilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the pioneer in your workplace while your colleagues are just starting to discover AI's potential, and how you're actively experimenting to understand its capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I feel like it has a lot of negative connotations which I'm hoping people will come to terms with. I see it as a tool which a lot of people don't understand, they think there's some sentient being in the computer that's doing their work. I feel like people probably had similar fears when computers were invented

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the misconceptions and fears people have. The comparison to early computer adoption is particularly thoughtful - you're right that new technologies often face resistance based on misunderstanding.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being an early adopter in a hesitant workplace, the practical challenges you've encountered, and your perspective on AI acceptance will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: You're welcome! Is that everything?

AI: Yes, that's everything! Thank you so much for participating in this interview. Your insights have been really valuable for our research. Have a great rest of your day!
