Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI for market research and content creation.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does the market research look like when you're using AI, and what kind of content are you creating?

User: So more typically I will request trending digital designs that are selling for sublimation design markets on digital marketplaces. I will look at broader seasonal trends but more specifically into incorporating the most current product momentum or predictions for demand.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI to identify what's hot in the sublimation design space. When you say you look at "broader seasonal trends" and "current product momentum," can you walk me through what that process actually looks like? How do you go about getting that information from AI?

User: In the past this has looked like broad brainstorming sessions that are guided by me. I will maybe begin with my preferred niche- puns and subtle nods to pop culture references.  This then transforms into key word searches and ideation evolves substantially from there.

AI: So it sounds like you start with your creative direction - the puns and pop culture references - and then it becomes this collaborative brainstorming process. When you say "key word searches and ideation evolves substantially from there," what does that evolution look like? How does the conversation between you and the AI typically unfold during those sessions?

User: This will often look like a list of ideas then intersecting with broad key words and up to date market research. From that point I will use those inspirations and then hone in ideas around the intersection of market research and key words to brainstorm potential product ideas. This could look like, for example- 'Skyrim' keyword search to capture market interests and I will partner with the model on how to capitalize the consumer search in a unique way.

AI: That's a fascinating process - using something like 'Skyrim' as a starting point and then figuring out how to capture that market interest uniquely. When you say you "partner with the model" on capitalizing consumer search, what does that partnership actually feel like? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth, or is there a different dynamic happening between you and the AI during that creative process?

User: It sometimes starts with a list of keywords I want to incorporate based on consumer interest and then branch from perhaps a collection of ideas the model comes up with and then I will dial in those ideas offering my own to incorporate and manipulate to a concrete list of potential products.

AI: So you're working together to refine those ideas - the AI generates possibilities and you add your own input to shape them into something concrete. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in this design process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to do design elements personally via digital design software like procreate. This is really because I enjoy to design and transform my work to a product that I sell (physical and digital). There are definitely things in the design space I could offload on AI but I really just love the design creation process.

AI: That's really telling - you love the actual design creation process and want to keep that for yourself. It sounds like there's something about that hands-on creative work in Procreate that's important to you beyond just getting the task done. When you think about the market research and brainstorming versus the actual design creation, what makes you want to collaborate with AI on one but keep the other to yourself?

User: Truly to save time. I would prefer to allocate my energy towards the work. I have enjoyed market research in the past and will not lean all the way into AI for this. AI has streamlined this considerable and I am likely to increase my use of it in this way.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - AI is helping you get through the research faster so you can spend more energy on the design work you really enjoy. You mentioned you won't lean "all the way into AI" for market research and have enjoyed doing it yourself in the past. What keeps you from fully delegating that research piece? What parts do you still want to be involved in?

User: I think personally it is just because I enjoy data synthesis. I know it is more in my best interest to delegate more though.

AI: It sounds like you're weighing what you enjoy against what might be most efficient for your business. When you do use AI for market research, how have your colleagues or peers in the design community influenced the way you approach it? Do you talk with other designers about how they're using AI, or has workplace culture played a role in how you think about these tools?

User: There are some of my peers that do not use it at all, but some that rely on it for similar reasons.

AI: What have those conversations with your peers been like? Do the ones who don't use AI at all have particular reasons they've shared with you, and how does that affect how you think about your own AI use?

User: When we have had those conversations my peers often are curious how I leverage it for keywords and SEO. My peers using or not using does not impact my own use of these tools.

AI: That's interesting - you're pretty independent in your decision-making around AI. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: That's tricky.. I think I have had issues with an AI model synthesizing the material to make it more scan-able. I have also had issues in the past with models not maintaining context from earlier in the conversation.

AI: Tell me more about that scanning issue - what did you need the material to look like, and how was the AI falling short of making it more scannable for you?

User: In the past that has looked like long lists not organized by type or style.

AI: So the AI was giving you these long, unorganized lists when you needed information grouped or categorized in a way that made sense for your work. How did you handle those situations when the output wasn't structured the way you needed it?

User: I prompted again with more instruction.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have considered it. I think for most people that may be a concern. For me personally, the things I do, I find enjoyable and pursued prior to it being a career.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - because you enjoy these things intrinsically, not just as work tasks. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI evolving in your design business?

User: I dont think I will necessarily involve AI in the design process. I will likely stay up to date testing capabilities, but for that portion of what I do I can't imagine letting AI take over that step.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on keeping the design creation process for yourself because you genuinely enjoy it, while being strategic about where AI can save you time.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with personal enjoyment, and how you've carved out this thoughtful approach to AI integration, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
