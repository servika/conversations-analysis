Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I'm ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently I use it for some administrative type tasks including summarizing email chains, helping draft parts of research writings, and occasionally for suggestions on how to design a slide deck.  We are trying to find more ways to use AI to automate task like pulling files and summarizing or finding specific words or acronyms in files.

AI: That's a helpful overview. When you mention using AI for drafting parts of research writings, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: Typically I'll do a lot of research myself, once I'm ready to write up findings I will give the AI assistant some key pieces I'd like to include and ask it to help me draft an opening paragraph for example.  I do not use it to write the whole piece.

AI: Tell me more about that decision to have AI help with specific sections rather than writing the whole piece.

User: Honestly, I do not trust the accuracy level enough to have it write whole pieces.  Another factor is my job is to research and write, if I'm having AI do it how do I keep my own writing and critical thinking skills sharp?  I'd rather uses as help vs. taking over an entire task.

AI: That's really insightful. You mentioned keeping your skills sharp - can you walk me through how you think about that balance? Are there specific ways you make sure you're still developing those abilities?

User: The nature of my work is writing, so I'm constantly doing it.  Also constantly editing and revising.  I find it odd when people have an AI assistant write their entire work, you aren't using your own brain when doing that, and eventually you'll lose the ability to do it all together.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you collaborate with it throughout tasks rather than delegating complete tasks - is that accurate?

User: That is accurate, I usually get myself to a point where I am ready to finalize things then I will use an AI assistant to get started like I said before, maybe ask it to help me with an opening paragraph or if it's a presentation a template for a slide deck.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Honestly, some colleagues have swayed me towards being overly cautious with it.  I know people who are using it to do everything and it's very apparent in their work, there will be inaccuracies that they didn't notice and if you ask them to tell you about what they wrote about they can't.  It's concerning to say the least.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfying, not having to design a template for a slide deck for a presentation, I'm not a graphic designer, I don't need to spend hours with powerpoint frustrated trying to "design" slides.  Frustration, when the information returned is inaccurate or it didn't follow instructions.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I feel like I will continue using it as a helper on my daily work, but as an innovator, I would like to find more meaningful ways to use AI tools to reduce task work to free up time for people to do more analytical work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI as a helpful tool while preserving your own critical thinking and writing abilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't thin so

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining your own skills while still benefiting from AI assistance, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
