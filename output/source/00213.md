Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here on behalf of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I am ready to go.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: On a typical day I use AI for bookkeeping clients, jobs range from calculating estimated state and federal taxes for users or researching client specific topics such as responding to an RFP. For my website work I use AI to troubleshoot WordPress websites that have technical topics beyond my expertise. These topics range from Cron job issues and complicated debug.logs. For photography I use it to assign keywords for stock photos, provide critiques and editing suggestions.

AI: That's a really diverse range of applications across your different work areas. You mentioned using AI for calculating estimated taxes for clients - could you walk me through what that process typically looks like when you're working on that kind of task?

User: First I provide the AI with the client name, year to date income, state they do business in and a the last quarter of total income. I ask for an amount on both the yearly and quarterly. This ensures that not just the quarter is accurate but also that there are no surprises at the end of the year.  I then copy the information and put it into a spreadsheet so that I have a track record for the year that shows the client adjusted as needed and paid what they should.

AI: That's a very systematic approach. When you're working through that tax calculation process, do you find yourself double-checking the AI's calculations or do you typically trust the results it gives you? I'm curious about how you handle the accuracy aspect of that work.

User: I am very good with numbers so I have an idea if the numbers look wrong. It does happen that the AI is wrong. Usually it is wrong because it was confused by requesting two different amounts that include some of the same timeframes. For example; gives me the year but adjusted out the quarter, gives the the same number for both periods. It is very rare that the problem is not large. Early on I did check every single amount. As I built up trust I switched to eyeballing it and trusting my own ability with numbers and percentages.

AI: That evolution from checking everything to developing that intuitive sense of when something looks off is really interesting. You mentioned that when the AI gets confused, it's usually not a small error but something more obvious. 

Tell me more about how you've built up that trust over time - what specifically made you feel comfortable enough to shift from checking every calculation to relying more on your own number sense?

User: As the AI learned what I was looking for there were fewer and fewer times that errors were involved. The responses were formatted more like I want them. I really did not want to see the math, it learned that and did not show me the math. I wanted simple statements that were easy to see the specific answer, over time it provided that. Each step of the process included fewer errors. Now the only time I see an error is when there is a model change or a new model coming out. These are highly publicized if you look for it. Because of that I can anticipate problematic times. Also, I learned more along the way how to phrase things to get what I wanted. The issues on errors were not one sided. Sometimes it is how I asked for things. Every time I learned something new that i needed to know, it built trust through understanding the AI. Every time the AI adjusted to my needs it built trust. Trust was a process for both the AI and me.

AI: That's a fascinating insight about trust being a two-way learning process. You described how both you and the AI adapted to each other over time - you learning better ways to phrase requests, and the AI learning your preferred format and level of detail.

When you're working on those other areas like WordPress troubleshooting or photography critiques, do you find yourself in that same kind of collaborative relationship, or does your interaction style change depending on the type of work you're doing?

User: My approach is always collaborative. I understand that I do not know what I do not know. That is what makes AI so helpful. It teaches me along the way. It does so in a fashion I can take in, which also builds trust. Sometimes I understand the highly technical Wordpress items and other times I do not. AI adjusts for those times. That makes the process even more collaborative. It helps that the AI recognizes, in most cases, where I need help and where I do not. It is 1% or less of the time I am not collaborative inn nature with AI. This was not true when I first started using AI. Trust came first.

AI: You've touched on something really compelling - this idea that AI teaches you along the way and adjusts to where you need help versus where you don't. 

Can you share a specific example of a time when you felt the AI recognized exactly where you needed help and adapted its response accordingly? What was that experience like for you?

User: The experience was validating. I had a cron job that was failing on a WordPress site. Cron jobs were new to me but I knew it was the problem. Because the cron job was related to a specific plugin the AI could have easily said its the plugin that has the issue. In fact, even humans said that at GoDaddy. I knew this was not the case and told the AI that. The AI had four or five options for me to check. The first one was ensuring that the website had enough traffic to trigger the cron job. It did not. A simple automated ping to the website solved the problem. It took me 20 minutes with AI. The AI acknowledged my expertise and said lets try other things. That was HUGE. GoDaddy ignored my expertise and tried to upsell me instead of helping. I had spent hours on the problem prior to asking AI. Now, AI is my go-to for WordPress issues because its faster, correct, and validating. The frustration over odd problems with websites was virtually eliminated with AI.

AI: That validation piece sounds really powerful - the AI acknowledging your expertise and working with you rather than dismissing what you already knew. You contrasted that with GoDaddy trying to upsell you instead of listening.

I'm curious about your colleagues or your workplace culture - how have they influenced the way you use AI in your work, if at all?

User: No. I was an early adopter so if anything I set the tone for others. Its a struggle though. People are resistant until the have a moment where they see and feel the amazing nature of how helpful AI can be. Once they do they are hooked.

AI: You mentioned that resistance people have until they have that breakthrough moment where they really see the value. 

What do you think creates that resistance initially, and what kinds of moments tend to be the ones that hook people once they experience them?

User: I think people do not use technology right in many cases. That leads to an over abundance of tech. Tech fatigue is real. With so much tech its hard to learn more tech. Also, most people think they can do it better. While that might be true in some cases it is at the loss of time and the increase of frustration.  Saving time and solving a problem are the two biggest things I have seen convince people. The next largest area is what did they learn that surprised or helped them.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - tech fatigue combined with the belief that they can do it better, even at the cost of time and frustration.

You've shared some really insightful experiences about working with AI. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What do you see changing or developing in how you work together?

User: It is my hope that my AI use will expand with more automation. However, that automation is best suited to platforms like this one. I hate the AI that QuickBooks has added. Bookkeeping has nuances. QB's AI does not understand this. Platforms like this do.  I am hopeful that it will be an all in one solution rather than AI in every solution. Maybe a better way to put it is add a platform like this to QuickBooks versus having AI automate without input from a user.

AI: That distinction you're making is really interesting - wanting this kind of collaborative AI platform integrated into tools like QuickBooks, rather than having AI that tries to automate without user input. It sounds like you value maintaining that collaborative control rather than full automation.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how trust develops as a two-way learning process between you and the AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, how trust builds through mutual adaptation, and your preference for integrated collaborative tools rather than standalone automation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
