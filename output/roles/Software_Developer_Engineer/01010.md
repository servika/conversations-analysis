Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Of course. As a software developer, I tend to use AI for brainstorming ideas, bug fixing, and getting a second opinion on software infrastructure. I use it mainly as a collaboration tool for me to build off of, and very rarely delegate complete tasks to AI, instead taking its input with a grain of salt.

AI: That's really interesting that you approach it as a collaboration tool rather than delegating complete tasks. 

Can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? For example, when you're brainstorming ideas or working through a bug - how does that back-and-forth process unfold?

User: Yes, for instance if I am building out a database for a web app, I may be considering several different structures depending on how they best serve the needs of the app. Take Firestore for instance, I may ask the AI model something along the lines of "What are the pros and cons of using a collection for x and y rather than an array" or "What structure is more cost efficient in read and writes". I then review and double check the AI answer to make sure it is correct and use it to help my decision making

AI: That's a really concrete example, thank you. It sounds like you're using AI to help evaluate trade-offs and inform your decision-making process, but you're still the one making the final call.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle most tasks myself because at the end of the day, AI can make mistakes and hallucinate, and when that happens, it is a huge hassle to detect what went wrong when I didn't write the code myself. I'd rather be able to understand exactly what I built and how I built it to facilitate bug fixing and follow industry standards.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you want to maintain that deep understanding of your own codebase. It sounds like there's a real trade-off between potential time savings and the longer-term maintainability and debugging challenges.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with how others on your team are using these tools?

User: I can not talk for others as I tend to work alone as an independent contractor in software development. I work for clients and build apps for then. I highly value the quality and robustness of my work, so I want to make sure that I am building the best possible product. I suppose in this sense, the desire to produce the best quality work for my clients prevents me from relying too much on AI, since the quality of my work is at stake.

AI: That's a really important perspective - as an independent contractor, your reputation and the quality of your deliverables are directly tied to your livelihood. The stakes are quite different when you're personally accountable to clients for everything you build.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recall one time when I chose to ask AI to build be a context component for a NextJS project as a way to save time, in my early days of using AI. I was hoping it would accelerate my process. However, what ended up happening is that it would build the context in a very illogical way which made it hard for me to integrate and led to time spent bug fixing. At the end I had to rewrite and code from scratch the context myself.

AI: That sounds like a frustrating experience - especially when you were hoping to save time but ended up spending more time debugging and ultimately redoing the work completely.

What did you learn from that situation? How did it shape the way you approach using AI for your work now?

User: I was reminded that AI is not perfect nor a substitute for a human developer and while it can be very useful in various situations, its input must be taken with a grain of salt.

AI: That experience really seems to have reinforced your current approach of using AI as more of a consultation tool rather than for task delegation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I believe that maintaining my skills in those areas is important. But I also believe that it is important how those areas are developing due to AI, or rather, how AI is developing due to these fields, and how I can find a niche spot to grow my career amidst all of that. After all, someone who knows the field had to program the AI so it too could learn it. Hence, how can I also dive into the new, fastly evolving and developing version of this field so as to follow the career wave? I think it is important to keep up with how it's evolving.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - not just maintaining existing skills, but staying ahead of the curve and understanding how the field itself is transforming. It sounds like you see AI as creating new opportunities rather than just replacing existing ones.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your current approach might change as the technology develops?

User: I do see my current approach evolving as the role of AI evolves too. Although I am not sure exactly how, I envision AI being much more involved in many ways while perhaps steering away from others. Perhaps my approach may begin to include some delegation as AI improves the quality of its deliverables, but still with limitations and keeping the fundamental idea that my work is my work and I should still have full control and understanding of it.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - staying open to change while holding onto those core principles about ownership and understanding of your work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how that early experience with the NextJS context component shaped your current collaborative approach, and your forward-thinking view on evolving alongside the technology rather than being displaced by it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing comes to mind. Thank you

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing collaboration with AI while maintaining code ownership, and how your approach has been shaped by both positive and challenging experiences, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
