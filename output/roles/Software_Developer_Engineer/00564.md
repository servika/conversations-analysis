Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I just it for programming, solving problems that I encounter at work.

AI: Tell me more about the programming problems you bring to AI. What specific types of issues do you find yourself turning to it for?

User: For example, today I was working on generating a PDF file out of a markdown text that had to be converted to HTML. I was having some issues with the PDF file skipping pages so I asked the AI to help me solve the issue.

AI: That sounds like a pretty specific technical challenge. Walk me through how that interaction went - did you describe the problem and let the AI handle it from there, or did you work through it together step by step?

User: I first described the whole issue and copy-pasted some code to the AI. It gave me a lot of recommendations, which I tried to use, but they either didn't work or caused other issues. Then I tried to be more specific: since I was trying to understand the problem so I could solve it, I asked the AI to focus only on the specific section I was inquiring about. However, it continued to provide a "solution" that didn't work, and I didn't fully understand how it arrived at it. After some time, I realized the problem wasn't related to the PDF library we were using, but to something else. Once I refocused my prompts on that section, I identified the cause, and we were then able to solve the problem, though it took a lot of time.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like there was quite a bit of back-and-forth before you got to the root of the issue. When you say the AI kept providing solutions you didn't fully understand, what was that experience like for you? How did you decide to keep working with it rather than trying a different approach?

User: I was very frustrated. At some point, I asked it how it had determined that the "root" of the problem was what it was suggesting. It started giving me more "reasons" for why that was the cause; however, although they kind of "made sense," they didn't really—they were just nonsense. It offered many ways to test the problem to confirm its theory, but at that point, I felt it was unnecessarily complicated. I decided to stop using the AI and continue researching on my own. I then started exploring other possible causes of the problem. When I identified another possibility, which turned out to be the likely cause, the AI helped me very quickly. However, to be honest, I regretted trying to use the AI right away; if I had spent more time thinking about the issue myself before asking, I would probably have resolved it sooner.

AI: That frustration really comes through - especially that moment when the AI was giving you reasons that sounded plausible but were actually nonsense. When you stepped away from the AI to research on your own, what did you do differently that helped you identify the real cause?

User: First, I did some research online; however, the library we were using is very old, and I didn't find much information. So, I tried to change my perspective on the problem and focused on understanding its possible causes. That's when I realized I had overlooked something that could be causing the issue. When I asked the AI specifically about a section I hadn't shown it before, it was able to guide me toward truly solving the problem. Essentially, I needed a better understanding of the problem first, so that I could then use the AI to help with the "final details."

AI: That shift in perspective sounds crucial. It seems like you needed to do that deeper problem analysis yourself first. Are there other types of programming tasks where you've noticed this pattern - where you get better results when you handle certain parts yourself before bringing in AI?

User: Yes. For example, sometimes I know exactly what to do, but I forget small details about the syntax or native functions of the language I'm working with. In those cases, I ask it to remind me, and it usually does so very quickly and effectively.

AI: So it sounds like AI works really well for you as a reference tool when you already have clarity on the approach. Thinking about your programming work more broadly, are there certain tasks you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I really enjoy doing the things I already know how to do. For example, creating a fairly simple new functionality for the ERP system I work on—I enjoy the whole process. I know I'm probably the exception, though, since my coworkers usually don't like doing that and rely on Copilot to complete much of the work with the autocomplete.

AI: That's really interesting that you still enjoy doing the work you know how to do. What is it about that process that you find enjoyable, and how does that compare to working with AI?

User: I enjoy creating all the templates and building the full functionality. We work with the MVC model, so creating the controller, view, and model, setting up the folders, adding the standard functions we use, and implementing validations—these are all fairly simple tasks that I enjoy. I also like doing them because it helps me remember the basics; I feel that if I stop, I'll forget how to do them myself. For that reason, I purposely use a text editor that doesn't have any AI assistance.

AI: That concern about forgetting the basics if you stop practicing them is really compelling. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider when deciding which tasks to handle yourself?

User: I'm trying to remind myself that I'm the one who has to do the heavy lifting when it comes to understanding the system as a whole. The AI can help me with small details here and there, but I'm the one who ultimately has to understand what's really going on. In this sense, even when I ask the AI for help, I focus on using it to aid my understanding rather than to do everything for me. This way, even if the AI handles a lot of the work I do eventually, I'll still be able to do it myself and, hopefully, won't forget how.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI to aid your understanding rather than replace it. You mentioned your coworkers tend to rely more heavily on tools like Copilot. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Since my company is really carefree, there's not much pressure for me to use AI at work. For example, everyone else uses VS Code, while I use Sublime Text. Sometimes they ask if I'm still using the same text editor, and I just reply that I am, and that's it. I guess that could be a kind of pressure, but I like to believe I'm not really being pressured by it. On the other hand, I don't like it when they see me asking questions to the AI. That's probably just my own insecurity, but I do notice that they use Copilot for basic and repetitive tasks and are able to solve difficult issues by researching on their own (I'm the only junior developer at the company). So, personally, I don't like them seeing me rely on AI for that, since I feel it diminishes my own ability to solve problems independently as they seem to do.

AI: That insecurity about being seen using AI is really interesting, especially as the junior developer. It sounds like there's this tension between wanting to maintain your problem-solving abilities and feeling judged for using AI. When you do use AI privately, like with that PDF issue we talked about earlier, does that self-consciousness affect how you interact with it?

User: It depends. Sometimes I work from home, and in that case, I use the AI freely. When I'm at the office, I've noticed that I reduce my AI use and try to research things on my own before turning to it. Even when I do use it, I keep it in a separate browser tab and just copy-paste an already prepared prompt. I also copy the AI's response into a text editor so that anyone passing by doesn't see that I'm using it. That's just probably me though, since I know a lot of people uses it at the company.

AI: That's such a vivid picture of how the physical workspace affects your AI use - having it in separate tabs and copying responses to hide it. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think these feelings about using it will change as you gain more experience?

User: I would like my use of AI to focus more on the small, easy details we discussed earlier, rather than helping me solve difficult problems. Maybe this is an old-fashioned idea, but I think it's important to know how to read documentation and find answers on my own. For that reason, I'd like to reduce my reliance on AI in this regard. Another possible use could be for small suggestions or improvements, but not for tasks that, as a developer, I feel are my responsibility to solve independently.
In this sense, I guess my feelings about using AI won't change anytime soon. However, if I become, in my own eyes, a more capable programmer and use AI as a tool, I feel I won't be ashamed of using it, since I will be relying on my own abilities.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to aid understanding rather than replace it, and how you're navigating that balance between tool use and skill development as a junior developer.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I'm good, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between using AI as a learning aid versus a problem-solver, and how workplace dynamics influence AI usage, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how honest you were about both the frustrations and the benefits you've experienced. Take care!
