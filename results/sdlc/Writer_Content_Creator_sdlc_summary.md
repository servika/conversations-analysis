## Representative Examples

### Example 1: Interview 00562

**SDLC Score**: 20

**Categories**: requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, projectManagement, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Typically I will share the clients project request details with AI. I will then provide in and out of scope items that I've worked with the client on and ask it to review those things and tell me what I may be missing for scope. Then I have it generate a work breakdown for Jira using the hierarchy o..."

2. "I prefer to handle tasks that have specific data inputs and outputs. This is based on past experiences of writing detailed prompts and uploading data in very specific structure only to get it back where those instructions were not fully fulfilled or data was missing or changed. I find that it is fas..."

### Example 2: Interview 00772

**SDLC Score**: 18

**Categories**: requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "well I guess like everyone, I often get various AI models to polish, draft or revise emails. Also other drafting activities like writing scripts, outlining projects...etc. But the majority of stuff I use it for is helping research, design, setup and script automations for data. So for example, I fre..."

2. "Well i was going to say no... but as I was thinking about it I realized i love the creative and directive phase of any project. So, no like fiddly tasks. But here's the thing. I LOVE automation. its the whole reason i originally learned VBA, then python, R, JS.... so when I've automated a task out o..."

### Example 3: Interview 01089

**SDLC Score**: 18

**Categories**: requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Well, in terms of developing the pyRevit tools, sometimes it could be dependent on office-wide standards, and other times, it can be on a per-project need.  I'll go through both."

2. "I try to be as specific and comprehensive as possible in the beginning as part of my initial prompt, in order to try for a complete solution right away, but there's always bound to be some iteration.  For example, for that project-specific script analyzing the scope boxes, here was my initial prompt..."

### Example 4: Interview 00743

**SDLC Score**: 15

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I mainly use AI for researching technological solutions, analysing technical configuration files for web, app and database servers, analysing log files, and finding well-sourced answers to compliance and legal questions relevant for my business. I don't use it that often, but it is slowly replacing ..."

2. "I've found web search quality to be in decline for at least 7 years now, and the proliferation of SEO copy, pop-ups and overlays, and now automated slop posts has made web research quite tedious. When seeking answers to technical questions, conflicting and incorrect answers abound. To solve these pr..."

### Example 5: Interview 00807

**SDLC Score**: 11

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Sure. I write the first drafts and then ask AI to tweak and tighten up my version. Then we engage in a back-and-forth conversation on its version versus mine to tighten up the final product and ensure it is both logical and comprehensive for the given task it is meant to concretize. Interacting with..."

2. "Well, I am the domain expert in most cases, so sometimes the AI's suggestions aren't comprehensive enough to understand the specifics of the use case I have in mind. For example, the AI doesn't always know the personalities at the other end of the message and what they may be looking for. Explaining..."
