Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions at this time.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a writer working on the query stage of submitting my book to agents. During the writing process, I used AI for grammar and punctuation as well as sentence and paragraph structure. It helped me brainstorm scenes and fact check. I often used it as a thesaurus as the thesaurus on Word wasn't very imaginative. At this point in time, I am struggling with the query letter and synopsis, and I look to AI for help with that. I used AI to design a cover for the book which was a lot of fun.
I often use AI to help with difficult conversations I need to have, writing emails, and general information.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses! It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into different phases of your writing process.

Tell me more about how you're using AI for the query letter and synopsis right now. What does that interaction typically look like?

User: I started out by asking AI what information it needed about my story to write a query letter. I then supplied those main points for it to generate different versions. I asked for one to be business like, one to be humorous, and one to be dramatic. I asked for one to sound like a NYC agent who was impatient and it was very funny. I never seem to get one just right though, and it's frustrating because I am struggling to do it myself. It is extremely difficult to get all the main points and theme into one page. Same with the synopsis.

AI: That sounds like a challenging process. You mentioned that you never seem to get one just right and it's frustrating because you're struggling to do it yourself.

What makes it difficult to get that "just right" version, even when you're working with AI on it?

User: There's always something missing in the query or synopsis that I feel is crucial to get across to the agent. I feel like I'd have to give AI the whole book in order for it to get the gist, the overview, and to convey the transformation the characters go through. Supplying a few nuggets or main points never seems enough to get a comprehensive query. I get that the query isn't supposed to tell the whole story, that it's meant to just hook the agent, but I'm never satisfied with it. Maybe there's information that I'm not supplying properly or I could be over analyzing it.

AI: That tension you describe is really interesting - feeling like AI needs the whole book to truly capture what you want to convey, but knowing that's not practical.

When you say you might not be supplying information properly, what do you think might be missing in how you're communicating with AI about your book?

User: I don't know. I've asked what it needs for a query letter and have supplied it. The humorous query was the best, it was the closest to perfect, but something still felt flat. I loved some of the wording and how it plugged in all the information I gave it, but they're always something missing. It may be just me, I'm trying to include too much in the letter and AI is actually doing a good job of editing.

AI: It sounds like there might be a tension between what you feel needs to be included and what actually works in a query letter. You mentioned the humorous one felt closest to perfect but still had something missing.

Can you walk me through what you do when you get a version back from AI that feels almost right but not quite there? How do you typically respond or iterate from that point?

User: It's great fun to see how it produces something so close to what I imagine but frustrating at the same time. I typically ask for another version minus what I found unsatisfactory. I go a couple of rounds like that and then quit to try another day. I did try combining a couple of the different queries and it ended up not flowing smoothly.

AI: That cycle you describe - going a few rounds and then stopping to try another day - tells me a lot about the experience.

When you reach that point where you quit for the day, what's driving that decision? Is it the AI hitting some kind of limit, or something else about the process itself?

User: I quit because I feel like I could just go around and around asking for different rewrites. AI will always do as I ask, but I wish I was better at telling it what I want, what I see as perfection. Maybe I'm wrong to aim for perfection, but I only get one chance for an agent to read my query and get hooked.

AI: That pressure of "only one chance" really comes through in what you're saying. It sounds like you're caught between wanting to leverage AI's ability to keep iterating and feeling uncertain about whether you're guiding it in the right direction.

When you think about that ideal query letter - the one that would hook an agent - do you feel like you'd recognize it if AI produced it, or is part of the challenge that you're not quite sure what "perfect" looks like for your specific book?

User: I think I'd know it if I saw it.

AI: That confidence about recognizing it is telling. 

So if you'd know the right version when you see it, but the back-and-forth with AI isn't quite getting you there, what do you think is happening in that gap between what you're asking for and what you're getting back?

User: I really don't know, but it has to be something about the information I am supplying.

AI: You keep coming back to that idea that it's about the information you're supplying. 

Can you think of a specific moment when you were working with AI on a query version where you felt like, "If only I could tell it this one thing..." - what was that thing you wished you could communicate but couldn't figure out how to?

User: If I knew that, I wouldn't have a problem lol

AI: Fair point! Let me ask this differently then.

You mentioned earlier that you've used AI for other types of difficult writing - like emails and difficult conversations. How does working with AI on those tasks feel different from working on the query letter?

User: There's a right way and a wrong way to handle a difficult conversation or write a proper email. A query letter is more about imagination and plugging in certain information so that it tells the story in an engaging but concise way.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the difference between tasks with clear right and wrong approaches versus something that requires more creative interpretation.

Given that difference, are there certain types of tasks where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?
