Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! Let's do it.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my typical workday, I use AI to proofread, answer grammar questions, reword things to be more grade/age appropriate. I use it to generate examples or simple content text. Sometimes I'll show it content and ask how that content could be improved if at all.

AI: That's a really interesting range of tasks - it sounds like you're working in education or content creation. 

Tell me more about when you ask AI to make content more grade or age appropriate. What does that process look like for you?

User: Sometimes I will have a list of vocabulary words that I want to generate really simple definitions for. I have access to the "real" definition to make sure that the basic integrity of the word is still accurately described. Anyways, I'll ask the AI to generate 2-3 options of definitions for that term based on a set of criteria like "X-grade level" or for "Multilingual Language Learners."

AI: That's a fascinating use case - using AI to create multiple definition options while you maintain oversight with the original definition. 

When you're working on these vocabulary definitions, do you find there are certain types of words or concepts where you prefer to write the simplified definitions yourself, even though AI could help? What makes you choose one approach over the other?

User: I find that AI can aim at being overly academic and I am constantly trying to encourage it to use simple vocabulary. This is not easy for the AI to do, so sometimes I do need to swap out vocabulary or grammar for what I know to be easier for a language learner.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a good sense of where AI's tendencies don't quite match what your students need.

When you're working on these definitions and making those vocabulary swaps, are you typically going back and forth with the AI throughout the process, or do you more often let it generate a complete set of definitions first and then edit them yourself afterward?

User: I will try to let the AI do as much as it can before I "take over". I'll try different prompts like "simplify the syntax" or "swap out difficult vocabulary words with more basic terms" but sometimes it's just easier for me to manually make those changes on my own

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're really trying to maximize what the AI can do before stepping in yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: I know many of my colleagues do not utilize our company-approved AI technology. However, the colleague I work closest to uses it in a similar capacity to me. However, I think I have more experience working with AI (aka this job), and so I think she overly trusts its responses sometimes. Whereas I have known it to be untrustworthy with some trickier grammar concepts, so my approach to using it is a bit more critical than hers.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - it sounds like your experience has taught you when to be skeptical of AI's output, especially around grammar.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I take the time to list out very specific instructions for the AI, and it doesn't produce the content in the way I requested (e.g., a bulleted list of single terms), that can be frustrating. It can also be frustrating when I can tell the AI is being influenced by my bias. If I ask a question where I'm looking for it to agree with me, I feel as though it lends itself to agree with me, rather than being critical (e.g., "this sentence is clear, right?") So, I find myself having to "trick" it into being objective by wording questions like, "What could be done to make this sentence clearer?"

AI: That's such a perceptive observation about how the way you phrase questions can influence the AI's responses. It sounds like you've really developed strategies to work around that bias.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about this and I do try to challenge myself to not hand over every task I can to AI. I want to be able to write original content quickly without the use of AI, if needed. That said, it's probably clear from my responses that I think AI needs to be managed and used critically in order to optimize it's results. Due to that, I still think AI will need "me" as a "manager" for tasks going forward.

AI: That's a really thoughtful balance - staying sharp in your own skills while also recognizing your role as someone who can effectively manage and direct AI.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I anticipate continuing to work with AI. I think I'll get better at writing meaningful prompts to get the "most" out of my work with AI. I also think the AI will improve and "learn" my needs better, which is something I look forward to.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've learned to "trick" the AI into being more objective by reframing your questions - that shows a sophisticated understanding of how to work with these tools effectively.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing in particular comes to mind. I do think AI is under-utilized in a lot of ways where it can be extremely useful, and over-utilized in ways where it really is not. For example, using it to quickly check grammar or provide examples is a great use of it, but using it to generate whole essays or chunks of text might not be.

AI: That's a really valuable insight about the spectrum of AI utility - the distinction between using it as a support tool versus a replacement tool. Thank you so much for sharing that perspective and for being so open about your experiences throughout our conversation.

Your insights about developing critical approaches to working with AI, the importance of staying skilled in your own areas of expertise, and the nuanced ways you've learned to get better results from AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Thank you again for your time and thoughtful responses. This has been really enlightening!

User: No problem, thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and thanks again for contributing to our research. Take care!
