Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am self-employed as a bookkeeper and administration assistant, helping a sole trader handyman with his small business. I tend to most often use AI to help me construct professional emails and documents. For example, I had ChatGPT assist me in creating a policy & procedure document around quoting, invoicing and accounts receivable. I tend to use AI more collaboratively than assigning it entire tasks. I will typically write a draft documents then run it through AI to find areas I need to improve and use it to help tweak sentences and paragraphs to read more professionally and ensure that I have not missed any important information.

AI: That's a really helpful picture of how you're integrating AI into your bookkeeping work. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot using it as a collaborative partner rather than handing off complete tasks.

When you mention tweaking sentences and paragraphs to read more professionally - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you decide what feedback from the AI to take and what to leave?

User: I tend to first give the AI specific instructions, for example I will ask it to read my document and provide a dot point list of things that could be improved as well as providing me with suggestions for things to add or remove for clarity. I will then ask for rewrites of specific sentences or paragraphs and then if there are parts of the AI rewrite that I prefer to my own writing, I will incorporate that into the final draft or document.

AI: That's a really methodical approach - breaking it down into specific improvement areas first, then working on individual sections. 

I'm curious about that final step where you're deciding which parts of the AI's rewrite to keep versus your own writing. What helps you make that decision? Are there certain qualities you look for that make you think "yes, that's better than what I wrote"?

User: I mostly look for wording or phrases that come across as more "professional" sounding. I will generally read through my own writing again as well as the AI rewrite and if anything in my original wording sounds repetitive or too casual I will either replace it completely or pick out wording that I prefer from the AI. I also like to give the AI keywords that I want to incorporate and ask it to include them in a way that reads naturally.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using the AI to help strike that professional tone while keeping control over the final product. The keyword incorporation is interesting too.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: If I feel like I can complete a task by myself, for example an email or more recently a cover letter and resume, I will. My approach to AI is that I would prefer to write or complete things by myself but if I am not completely happy with what I have produced or if I feel like it is taking more time to construct something than I would like, I turn to AI to help me out.

AI: That's really insightful - so AI becomes more of a backup when you hit those friction points, rather than your first go-to. It sounds like there's a balance between maintaining your own capability and efficiency.

When you do use AI for work, I'm getting the sense from what you've shared that you lean heavily toward that collaborative approach - working with it throughout a task rather than just handing something off completely. Is that accurate, or are there times when you do delegate entire tasks for AI to handle independently?

User: I only ever use AI collaboratively, and when I do I often challenge it with leading questions or alternative lines of thinking to ensure that it is not hallucinating or being misleading. I don't think AI is at a place yet where we should be entrusting it completely as it does tend to provide false information, so I definitely avoid giving it independent tasks.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - actively challenging the AI to test its reasoning. It sounds like you've developed some healthy skepticism around AI's reliability.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned you're self-employed working with a sole trader, I'm curious how that dynamic plays out - does your client have views on AI use, or is this more of an independent decision you've made?

User: My client has occasionally used AI to help them construct quotes or to ask how it would approach a particular task, but I think due to the nature of the work they often just take the AI answer into account and then come to their own conclusion. My client and those around me have no issue with AI use, as long as it is not performing the bulk of the work and is used as a tool rather than viewed as a digital coworker.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - AI as a tool versus a digital coworker. It sounds like there's an understanding that the human judgment and expertise should remain central.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used AI to help me construct a letter of engagement, which was very helpful. I had an example letter from the organization where I completed my training. I used that as the skeleton of the document, replacing the information with my own and then collaborating with the AI to help me determine what pricing would be considered appropriate, to help tidy up paragraphs to sound more professional and to consider what else I should add to the document. While it was satisfying to be able to produce this document in a relatively short amount of time, part of me does regret using AI as it is not my own work and therefore not my own achievement. I have also not put this document into effect yet and will likely go over it several more times before I feel truly happy with it.

AI: That's such an honest reflection - the tension between the practical satisfaction of getting something done efficiently and that feeling that it's somehow not fully your own achievement. That seems like a really common experience people are grappling with.

You mentioned you'll likely go over that document several more times before you're truly happy with it. What do you think drives that need for additional review when AI has been involved in the process?

User: I want the document to reflect myself and my business and I also need to ensure that anything the AI has suggested I include complies with local regulations and legislations.

AI: That makes complete sense - ensuring the document truly represents you and meets all the legal requirements. The compliance piece is particularly important in your field.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have definitely thought about it. I have only recently changed my career to bookkeeping and it is entirely possible that this is a field that AI could take over, at least to some degree. I just have to trust that there will always be people who prefer to have a human overseeing their finances and that AI will continue to be viewed as a tool in this field, rather than taking over it completely.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective, especially given that you've recently transitioned into this field. The trust in that human preference for financial oversight makes a lot of sense.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as you get more experience in your field?

User: My hope is that as I gain more experience and confidence in myself that I will feel the need to use AI less.

AI: That's a really interesting way to think about it - AI use potentially decreasing as your own expertise grows. It suggests you see AI as more of a confidence-building tool right now rather than a permanent fixture.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest reflection about that tension between efficiency and personal achievement, and your very deliberate approach to using AI collaboratively while maintaining skepticism about its reliability.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: My only other note would be that as someone who has experience in training AI models, I may be more skeptical than others around me of their capabilities. I definitely know some people who would be happy to hand over many tasks to AI without any collaboration or altering at all.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - your background in training AI models certainly gives you a different lens for understanding both the capabilities and limitations. It's interesting how that technical knowledge shapes your more cautious, collaborative approach compared to others who might be more willing to fully delegate tasks.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between efficiency and ownership, the importance of human oversight in professional contexts, and how technical knowledge influences AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

I really appreciate your thoughtful responses throughout our conversation!
