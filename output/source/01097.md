Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions, let's do it

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a data scientist, my work generally consists of three types of "tasks": 
1) project related tasks, this involves preparation for the project and documentation, for example, meeting with clients, communicating with the client's different teams, and documenting my work.
2) research tasks, these spans a wide variety of sub tasks, from solution design, to researching what models to use, and coming up with specific techniques for the solution.
3) coding tasks, this involves the actual implementation of the solution. This step is often iterative, until a satisfactory outcome is achieved.
In all these tasks AI plays a supporting role. I use it to improve my written communication and documentation in project related tasks. I use it as a starting point for my research tasks, to gather a broad range of approaches, and checking the sensibility of my ideas with it. I use it to augment my coding tasks, so finding bugs, checking if my code works properly, writing certain components of my code.

AI: That's a really comprehensive breakdown of how AI supports different aspects of your work. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to use AI as a starting point for my research, but I still like to conduct the thorough research myself, often I'll notice AI missed some things, or some of the ideas it gives me aren't actually viable, or it hallucinated an idea all together, so I like to do the in-depth part of this task myself. Also with respect to coding, I like to use it for help, but I still like to write some of the code myself, this could be due to idiosyncrasies I prefer, but also just to stay somewhat sharp and still able to code myself.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've found a balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your own expertise and judgment.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: it's usually a very collaborative process, where I copy and paste a lot from different sources into the AI to ask it questions.

AI: Tell me more about that collaborative process. What does that back-and-forth typically look like for you?

User: when I have a general question that I want to gather some starting points for, I'll ask my questions, and use the ideas it provides as inspiration, or use the sources it provides as the starting point of my research. For code, I'll paste some of my code, or describe a component with certain behavior I want (e.g., I need a Python function that does X and Y constrained by Z), then iterate if it doesn't do exactly what I want, so ask for modifications to that component, or paste an error generated by the code, and ask it to fix it.

AI: That iterative approach sounds like a natural workflow. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: To be honest I started using AI more when I noticed more of my colleagues using at work

AI: What was it about seeing your colleagues use AI that influenced you to start using it more? What did you observe them doing with it?

User: Seeing how it sped their work up and how that can be a benefit to me, as well as providing a "faster" launching pad to approach new topics I'm less familiar with. They often use it in speeding up their coding process, as well as, generating ideas and search.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I try to maintain my skills somewhat by practicing my skills often, even if AI is becoming superior in that area. For some tasks it's still more efficient to be good at a skill, even if AI is better at it. For example, despite AI being better at articulation and communication, it's still very important to be somewhat good at these skills, because of client meetings, it doesn't make sense to go back and forth with AI during a client meeting, I have to be able to deploy these skills quickly and in context without waiting for input from AI.

AI: That's a really practical way of thinking about it - the real-time, contextual nature of some work situations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: satisfied, when it writes an efficient coding component that would have taken me a much longer time to write, so it saves me a lot of time, and I'm able to iterate quickly on the solution I'm working on.
frustrated, when I'm using it for research or idea generation, and gives me some "non-context specific" response that's irrelevant to my use case, that sounds superficially good, and I have to spend a lot of time going through it to find out it's not relevant.

AI: That frustration with non-context specific responses that sound good on the surface is really interesting - it sounds like that can actually slow you down more than help.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: yes, I think the coding portion will gradually be more and more automated, and I see it playing a bigger role in research and solution design in the future.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining skills for real-time situations like client meetings, even when AI might be superior in those areas.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI use, the balance between leveraging AI and maintaining your own skills, and the importance of context-specific responses will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
