**Transcript ID:** User: as AI expands and becomes ""smarter

---

" I will likely ease into asking more complex baking questions. Or, if I get the chance to develop and create my own recipes, I will likely ask for advice from AI. I also want to start asking AI more about creative names for various projects, as those are difficult to come up with too.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in baking. I particularly appreciated your perspective on seeing AI as a collaborator rather than a threat, and how you're using it as a creative memory aid for flavor combinations while maintaining clear boundaries around the technical aspects you want to control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your baking work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think that's it! Happy I could help.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative partner while maintaining expertise in the technical aspects of baking will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really interesting to hear how you've found your own comfortable way to integrate AI into your work, even in an environment where others might be more skeptical. Thanks again for participating!
