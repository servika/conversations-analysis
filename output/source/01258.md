Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's get started!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your research process. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently worked on a Research Project where I was trying to come up with a method for making an iPSC lysate which could prime dendritic  cells in vivo. I needed to find a way to make this antigen (the iPSCs) into a "dead" form which could stimulate the immune system without causing adverse effects. In essence the lysate should train dendritic cells against that antigen when it faces it again without causing an immune storm which would be unsafe. I had to do a lot of literature search to see what had already been done (for example using cancer tumour lysates instead, since the idea is very similar) and this helped me to narrow down which methods of making the lysate I could use - for example freeze/thaw or sonication. In the end, I used irradiation to induce immunogenic cell death which also made the iPSCs senescent so they wouldn't multiply in the body. In any case, I made a review of the literature to inform the methods to test. Following that, I had to come up with an experimental plan which included deciding on my readouts, which for me were luminescence (caspase 3 and cell titer glo) measurements of cell death and also flow cytometry. This produced a lot of data which I had to process to come up with a statistical analysis of the cell death. I had to produce several reports including a written report (formatted like a scientific paper) and a presentation to update my supervisors.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - the idea of creating a safe but immunogenic lysate is really clever. I can see how that involved multiple complex stages from literature review through experimental design to data analysis and reporting.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I had experimented with using AI in the beginning to inform my literature search - for example, I did necessarily rely 100% on the "facts" the AI gave me, but I asked it to look into the literature for the general methods that were used, which then allowed me to read the relevant papers. It definitely decreased the time I spent doing the keyword searching since I could describe the types of papers that might be relevant to me. The AI also suggested further avenues of thought/research that I hadn't thought about. The AI proved particularly useful when it came to regulatory ideas because those documents are often difficult to parse through, so it pointed me to the right documents to talk about legislation for iPSC derived cell products. I also used it a bit to help with cleaning up my writing for the reports. I had written a draft myself but asked AI to make sure the grammar was perfect and to suggest better ways to phrase things.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you found AI particularly valuable for navigating complex regulatory documents and as a starting point for literature exploration. 

For the literature search specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding relevant papers.

User: Using the "traditional method" of using a search engine such as PubMed and searching for keywords often resulted in many irrelevant papers. In order to find recent papers, I had to also sort by "newest first" rather than "relevance" which further increased the number of irrelevant papers. Normally, I am alerted to key papers by my supervisors who are attending conferences and may have access to unpublished information. For this, I still had to rely on them. But, since I was quite new to the field of study I needed to start from the basics which required going through older papers which discussed the fundamentals before going on to look at newer papers. In this instance AI was particularly useful at describing to me the key concepts and pulling out the relevant papers in a sea of papers in the Immunology topic and Cancer topic (which is numerous!!).

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like AI helped you cut through the noise, especially when you were starting from the basics in an unfamiliar field with such a vast literature base.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like the experimental design, data analysis, or flow cytometry work - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: For experimental design, I often want to follow specific protocols from paper to start with an make small changes myself based on what is relevant. I often do this in the lab/decide on the go which makes an experimental design from AI a bit inflexible. However, when it has come to doing calculations, I have used AI to help in some instances. I have at least once had an incorrect calculation though which I had to check myself anyway which essentially took double the time. For data analysis (e.g. flow cytometry), I am mostly using specialised software such as FloJo which allows you to visualise cells of gates and create histograms. Although in theory the data is number based, I don't think giving it to an AI as it works now would end up with the output I want. There is an industry-standard presentation of flow cytometry data and outside of programs such as FloJo it would be a bit unusual and not widely accepted. Furthermore, Flow Cytometry is considered a bit more of a subjective "art" so it requires the experience of scientists who have worked with this method a lot to see what looks right, it is not always objective based on the numbers alone (i.e. MFI, number of cells in each quadrant/gate etc.)

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like the flexibility you need for real-time lab decisions and the subjective expertise required for flow cytometry analysis don't align well with how AI currently works. And that calculation error definitely highlights the verification challenge.

When you've used AI for literature searches and writing cleanup, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I have to physically check the paper itself. It helps me to get the general idea but I would never 100% rely on AI to get the right thing. If I quote a paper in my literature review or paper, I will always have to verify the validity of it by  reading the paper myself and looking at the methods they've used to check that the controls are appropriate and there isn't anything sketchy going on. For writing cleanup, I, of course, have to read through what it has written and check there are no extra hallucinations which weren't in the original version, for example, I'd have to fact check every fact that was added that I didn't add.

AI: That verification approach makes complete sense - you're essentially using AI as a research assistant but maintaining scientific rigor by checking the primary sources yourself.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'd love to hear about your future vision: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I suppose it would be good if AI could be integrated into those standard programs such as FloJo because there is a lot of difficulty sometimes in using those programs e.g. for compensation. I think it could be added as an AI helper where you could ask questions and it could guide you to the right section of the help guide or else have "AI settings" where it uses the information about the input parameters to give the right settings.

AI: That's a really practical vision - essentially having AI serve as an intelligent guide within the specialized software you already trust and use, rather than replacing the tools entirely. It sounds like you'd want it to enhance your existing workflow rather than disrupt it.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how you balance AI assistance with scientific rigor, and your preference for AI that works within established tools rather than replacing them, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No that's all ! :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point for literature exploration while maintaining rigorous verification practices, and your vision for AI integration within existing specialized software rather than replacement, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's clear that trust and verification are central to how you approach AI tools, and that the flexibility needed for hands-on lab work presents unique challenges for AI integration. These perspectives are incredibly valuable for our research.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
