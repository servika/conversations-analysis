Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I'm ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, I could AI in a variety of ways. I'm a content writer, often writing short articles or blog posts. These posts tend to be very research heavy and I'm often focusing on 3-5 short keywords and 3-5 long-tail keywords or phrases. I often use AI to help me with research, either by giving it the topic and asking it to provide the information I need or by dumping a bunch of my own research and asking the AI to organize it for me with a focus on my content's topic. 

Additionally, I often use AI to help me find organic ways to place specific keywords into my blog posts. It can be challenging to determine a way to get certain keywords or phrases in a sentence without it sounding contrived, especially when I'm targeting local keywords that need to be written a specific way. For example, I wrote an article recently for a vacation home rental website and the long-tail keyphrase I needed to target was "Winter Harbor, Maine cheap vacation rentals." AI helps me fit things like that into my articles in a natural sounding way and also checks for keyword stuffing for me. 

I also self-publish short novels on KDP and I use AI to assist with quite a few parts of this process. It helps me brainstorm ideas for new plots or characters or names. It also helps me with sentence structure (I tend to overuse certain filler words and AI helps me figure out how to rearrange sentences to avoid them). I also send it cover designs as I work on them and it gives me suggestions for elements to include, filters, lighting, and more.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you've integrated AI into several distinct parts of your creative and content work. 

Tell me more about that research organization process you mentioned. When you dump your own research and ask AI to organize it, what does that interaction typically look like?

User: I have a CustomGPT I created specifically to help me with that task. The custom instructions I created instruct it to analyze the information I provide it and categorize it depending on the blog or article topic I provided. It's also instructed to pull phrases related to the keywords I give it so I know which sections of the research provided I should focus on. 

In terms of steps, I paste blocks of text containing the research I'm working from. In the same chat box, I also give the blog or article topic and a list of keywords. Then, I send the message and wait for the AI to do its magic.

AI: That's really interesting how you've customized the AI specifically for your workflow. When you get that organized research back from your CustomGPT, how do you typically work with it from there? Do you take that output and run with it yourself, or do you continue collaborating with the AI as you write the actual article?

User: It depends on how complex the research and topic is. If it's something very niche, like the manufacturing process for ice skates, then I often continue collaborating with the AI to come up with an outline for my blog post. Otherwise, I take the information it gave me and complete the outline step myself.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that sometimes you handle the outline step yourself rather than collaborating with the AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When it's a super quick and easy task, I just prefer to draw it up myself. It's important to me to maintain that skillset, so sometimes I even do it myself if it's a challenging project. Often, it depends more on mood than pure logic. It's a task I enjoy and don't mind delegating, but I also want to make sure I don't lose my skillset.

AI: That's really thoughtful - maintaining your skills while still leveraging AI's capabilities. You mentioned mood playing a role in your decision-making. 

Can you tell me more about what influences your mood when it comes to choosing between doing something yourself versus using AI?

User: Often it depends on how long it's been since I've drawn up the outline myself. If I've been delegating that task to AI for a straight week, I'll take a break and do it myself for a few days to make sure I'm keeping up on my creativity.

AI: That's a really deliberate approach to balancing AI use with skill maintenance. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned you're a content writer and also self-publish, I'm curious about both contexts.

User: I'm a freelance content writer, meaning I don't work with a team. I get hired through sites like UpWork and my clients just provide me an outline of the assignment. So, workplace culture and colleagues haven't factored into my usage of AI at all for content writing. 

There is, however, a massive trend against using AI in the indie/self-publishing industry, so I'm very quiet about my usage of it online

AI: That's really interesting about the contrasting environments - complete freedom in your freelance work versus the trend against AI in self-publishing. 

Can you tell me more about how that trend in the self-publishing community affects your approach? How do you navigate using AI while being quiet about it?

User: I just never mention it or involve myself in conversations relating to AI. It's unfortunate because AI is genuinely a helpful tool that could help a lot of new authors get off their feet, but the issue's become so heavily moralized in the community it's impossible to speak out about it. Anyone who is 'caught' using AI in the indie world gets flamed online, which can destroy a new author's career, so it's best to stay silent about the topic for now.

AI: That sounds like a challenging dynamic to navigate. Given those different environments you work in, can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was a time when I was researching a very niche topic (ice skating accessories) and I asked the AI to give me a list of accessories I could research. Half the items it suggested I look into turned out to be non-existent. But, since it was such a niche topic, I spent a lot of time trying to track down the suggestions on ice skating forums and Reddit before I finally realized they weren't real. So, that was a pretty frustrating experience.

AI: That does sound frustrating - especially when you're on a deadline and spending time chasing down information that doesn't exist. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? You mentioned doing outlines yourself periodically, but I'm curious if this is something you actively consider more broadly.

User: It is something I've thought about, particularly where it relates to the self-publishing industry. A lot of people dislike AI because they believe it could make writers irrelevant, but I truly don't believe that's the case. Human creativity and spontaneity isn't recreatable, and we shouldn't attempt to. AI is a tool and it's not meant to be a replacement for human creativity. It's meant to take on the more routine and mundane tasks, allowing us more time to focus on our creative tasks.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on AI as a tool for handling routine tasks while preserving the creative work for humans.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: At the moment, I don't see using it for much more. I've pretty much integrated it in every way I think is reliable and worthwhile at this point.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a tool for routine tasks while preserving human creativity, and how you're navigating such different attitudes toward AI across your freelance and self-publishing work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing skill maintenance with AI efficiency, navigating different industry cultures, and the practical challenges like dealing with AI hallucinations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
