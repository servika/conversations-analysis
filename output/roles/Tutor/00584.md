Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope! I don't have any questions, and I am ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Hmmm thats a great question. I work a couple of different jobs, but I think the main role that I work in that utilizes AI is tutoring. When I was training with this company we were encouraged to utilize AI in terms of doing more tedious tasks like creating problem sets/answer keys. We also were encouraged to work with AI as a tool for practice explaining certain topics that may be difficult for students/tools to make the explanations of these topics easier.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI for both the preparation work and for practicing your explanations. 

Tell me more about how you use AI to practice explaining difficult topics. What does that process actually look like for you?

User: With this, i normally have a specific topic in mind that I am more iffy on how to communicate to students and then I will explain the context and situation to the AI model I am using. I have it pretend that it is a student who is at the given grade level and proficiency in the topic and then I do a type of voice chat with it to practice how I would verbalize the topic once I feel as if the model knows what is going on

AI: That's fascinating - so you're essentially using the AI as a practice student to rehearse your teaching approach. 

When you're in those voice chat practice sessions, how does the AI respond as a "student"? Does it ask the kinds of questions or show confusion in ways that feel realistic to what you'd encounter with actual students?

User: I have gone through a good amount of trial and error with training/prepping the model to respond similar to how a student would but I have found that at this point, the AI model does a good job asking questions about common areas of confusion as well as pushing me to try explaining things in a different way (to simulate a student not understand something after I originally explained it)

AI: That trial and error process you mentioned sounds really important. 

What did you have to adjust or change about how you set up these practice sessions to get the AI to respond more like a real student would?

User: I had to be very specific about the type of mock student interview I wanted to do. I made sure to tell the model to question my explanations and that I don't want them to just be a "yes man" and understand every topic and explanation the first time I go through it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - getting it to actually challenge your explanations rather than just accepting everything.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your tutoring work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Hmmm, thats a good question. I think that there are certain things that I prefer to do myself rather than rely on AI for a few reasons. One being that it takes a good amount of time to setup these kinds of conversations and ensure the AI is doing everything properly and in the method I want them to do. So if I think that it will end up taking more time to explain everything to the AI before I get my help compared to just doing it myself I will do it my own faster.

AI: That efficiency calculation makes a lot of sense - weighing the setup time against just doing it yourself.

Can you give me an example of a specific task where you've decided it's faster to just handle it yourself rather than go through that AI setup process?

User: things like checking over my students homework is much faster for me to do it alone

AI: That's a good example. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? 

Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task - going back and forth - or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: i am much more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task. there aren't too many situations I know of that apply to me that I would have it do a complete task independently

AI: That collaborative approach seems to fit with how you described those practice sessions - going back and forth to refine things.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the tutoring company's encouragement shaped how you approach it, or have you picked up tips from other tutors?

User: I definitely think that over time AI has become more and more normalized in both the workspace and education, so I think even simple things like my boss saying that I can use AI to help make problem sets made me feel more comfortable finding ways to make AI ease my load

AI: That normalization aspect is really interesting - how that permission opened the door for you to explore other ways AI could help.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't have a specific memory that I remember off the top of my head but I do know that there have been many times that I had explained something to the model before and it forgets to do a portion of the instructions. this happens more often the longer and more complex the instructions are.

AI: That forgetting issue sounds really frustrating, especially when you've spent time setting up those detailed instructions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I think about but I think, at least for now, the mix of there being low skill and trust for certain tasks to be completed by AI will keep my role a necessary one for the coming years...i hope haha

AI: Ha, that "I hope" really captures the uncertainty many people feel about this!

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll find new ways to use it, or do you see it staying pretty much the same as how you use it now?

User: I totally think that there will be new inventive ways to use AI at my workspace in the future, even eventually fully replacing tutoring (as you could talk to a voice chat bot that is able to access a wealth of information on how to tutor effectively). in the more short term I don't know how much else AI could really assist me as a tutor (except maybe more of the clerical work)

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that balance between setup time and efficiency, and how you've developed that collaborative approach with the practice sessions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your tutoring work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No i think that's all from me. i appreciate your thoughtfullness

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a practice student, that trial-and-error process of getting it to challenge your explanations properly, and your thoughts on the evolving role of AI in tutoring will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
