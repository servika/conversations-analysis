Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. We can start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have used AI to do some vibe-coding of applescripts and python scripts. I have used AI to do quick HTML coding for simple web pages. I have used AI to do rewrites on catalog info pages on amazon for my products. I have used AI to draft ideas for graphics for products I sell. I have used AI to bounce writing ideas off of.

AI: That's quite a range of different tasks you're using AI for. I'm curious - when you mentioned using AI for "vibe-coding" applescripts and python scripts, what does that process look like for you? How do you typically work with AI on those coding tasks?

User: I have found that if I start with a detailed list of things to accomplish, I can get lucky and get something useful on the first try. It's mostly for data extraction and formatting. If I'm not happy with the result, I have been able to debug a couple things, but I'll usually start again with a revised prompt.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned getting "lucky" with useful results on the first try. Tell me more about what makes the difference between when it works well versus when you need to start over with a revised prompt.

User: If I can't get the correct data manipulation, it is often because of a problem with translation of my requirements to the model. I have had a few times where I need to some at the problem with a different type of prompt in order to get a useful script.

AI: So it sounds like the way you frame your requirements really matters for getting useful results. When you say you need to "come at the problem with a different type of prompt," can you walk me through what that looks like? How do you typically adjust your approach?

User: Here's a rough example:

AI: I'm listening - what's the example?

User: I had an order list that was downloaded in HTML and the model could not get the data parsed correctly. I then printed the HTML file as a PDF and when I changed the prompt to parse the data from the PDF, I was able to get a useful result.

AI: That's a clever workaround - converting HTML to PDF to get better parsing results. It sounds like you had to think creatively about how to present the problem differently to the AI.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: For me it really depends on how much time I could save in the future. If I can create simple scripts to do tasks that I have done manually up until now, I'll invest the time to work through a solution with vibe-coding.

AI: So it's really about that future time savings calculation for you. When you're deciding whether to invest the time in working with AI to create those scripts, what helps you figure out if it's worth that upfront investment?

User: It comes down to whether it

AI: I see you were cut off there - you were saying it comes down to whether it what?

User: It comes down to how regularly I have to do the task. If it's something I do every morning to start processing orders, I'll definitely see if the AI model can do it more quickly, or I'll try to work on a script, either applescript or python, that can do it for me. These types of tasks are going through a list of orders that I need to extract the relevant item data so that I can produce the items that are required for the day.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those daily, repetitive tasks are prime candidates for automation. When you're working with AI on creating these scripts for your order processing, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I generally try to write the prompt so that the model either completes the task correctly, or give me an idea to rewrite the prompt. I have not had much success doing iterative "nudging" in the canvas workspace or whatever the collaborative tool is called for that model.

AI: So you're more in a delegation mode - trying to craft that one good prompt that gets the complete result rather than working back and forth collaboratively. You mentioned not having much success with iterative nudging in collaborative workspaces. What made those collaborative approaches less effective for you?

User: It just feels to me like the original problems kind of follow the trail if I try to keep the problem in the same chat. The results have seemed cleaner if I start over and edit my prompt to make my needs or the needed results, more clear.

AI: That's a really interesting observation - that the "trail" of the original problem seems to persist and affect later attempts. So you've found that starting fresh with a cleaner, more refined prompt tends to give you better results than trying to iterate within the same conversation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work by myself so that doesn't really apply to me. If I have an interesting problem that I need more background on to solve, I will do a web search or find a reddit thread that shows how someone else attacked it.

AI: Got it - working solo gives you a lot more freedom to experiment without worrying about workplace policies or colleague opinions. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have a daily, or even twice daily task that I used to do by doing manual search and replace to polish up the standard invoices that amazon creates. I was able to use ChatGPT to first make a python script and then modify that to an applescript that I am able to use successfully every day, saving me at 20 minutes a pop and with far fewer mistakes.

AI: That sounds like a really successful implementation - saving 20 minutes twice daily and reducing errors is significant. What made that particular project work so well compared to other times you've worked with AI? Was there something different about how you approached that problem?

User: No, that experience has colored the way I interact with the model. I had to rewrite the prompt 4 times I believe in the beginning. When I tried the applescript conversion, I still had to debug one syntax issue to get it to work properly.

AI: So that successful experience taught you that persistence through multiple prompt revisions can really pay off. It sounds like you learned that even when it takes several tries, the end result can be worth that upfront effort.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think I would navigate that change in a slow and careful manner. I'm more inclined to pass things to an AI if I feel like it's drudgery to me. If I'm doing something I consider more creative or intellectual, I would rather keep doing it myself.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction - keeping the creative and intellectual work for yourself while offloading the drudgery. When you think about that line between what you'd want to keep versus delegate, how do you decide what counts as creative or intellectual versus drudgery for you?

User: The line would be where I think I'm actually putting something in that reflects my unique or personal viewpoint or skill.

AI: That's a clear way to think about it - keeping the work where your unique perspective and skill really matter. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I

AI: I'm listening - how do you see it evolving?

User: sorry, I have been impressed with the way some AI models exhibit novel types of thinking or viewpoints. That would be something that I would use in both idea generation and editing of writing ideas.

AI: That's really interesting - you're seeing AI not just as a tool for automation but potentially as a thinking partner that can offer novel perspectives. That sounds like it could expand beyond just the drudgery tasks you mentioned earlier.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your approach of treating AI more as a delegation tool rather than a collaborative partner, and your clear distinction about keeping work that reflects your unique viewpoint.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's pretty much all I have for now.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the importance of clear prompting, the value of starting fresh rather than iterating, and your thoughtful approach to deciding what to delegate versus keep have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
