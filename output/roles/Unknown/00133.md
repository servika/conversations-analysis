Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good.  No, I do not have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's get started then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am responsible for developing and reviewing curriculum for adult learners.  So the main way I use AI is to come up with ideas for interactive engaging learning activities to use during classes and asynchronously.

AI: That sounds like a really creative application of AI in education. When you're using AI to come up with these learning activities, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I usually begin with asking the chatbot for a few activity ideas based on the learning objectives of the chapter. Then I choose what I consider to be the idea that most fits my needs or the criteria provided.  The ideas provided are usually suggested outlines or instructions. From there I usually request content that further explains the concepts or expands the activity.

AI: That's a really interesting iterative process you've described. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your curriculum development work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Not that I can think of.  I try to rely on AI as much as possible because I have very tight deadlines to meet. There may be tasks that AI could help with, but I don't know what they are.

AI: That makes sense given your tight deadlines. When you're working through that process you described - starting with activity ideas, then choosing one, then requesting more content - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with the AI throughout developing an activity, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate with the AI throughout development of the activity, because I want to make sure the information provided is accurate and that the instructions make sense.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really thoughtful, especially given the importance of accuracy in educational content. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Many of my colleagues use AI as well. But I was using it before I knew that they were too.  So, I would have to say that the workplace culture did not have much influence.  But it was good to know that AI use was not frowned upon or discouraged.

AI: It sounds like you were something of an early adopter in your workplace. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: For the most part I have been satisfied when using AI at work.  However there are times when I am trying to create educational activities, the ideas provided by AI are typical, repetitive, and less than engaging.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. When you encounter those typical or repetitive suggestions, how do you handle that situation? Do you have strategies for pushing the AI toward more creative or engaging ideas?

User: The closest thing to a strategy I have is to request a minimum of three ideas at a time.  Then, I am able to combine different elements from each idea to create a more engaging activity.

AI: That's a smart approach - using multiple suggestions as building blocks rather than taking one wholesale. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am constantly improving my skills or learning new ones.  I feel this is important in order to work collaboratively with AI.  The output provided by AI still needs to be reviewed for accuracy and efficacy.  So it is necessary for me to remain knowledgeable.  That way I can create the right types of prompts and check the information provided by AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on maintaining expertise to work effectively with AI. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect my relationship with AI at work to continue to grow.  As I learn more about what it is capable of doing, I look forward to it making my job easier.  I view AI as tool to make me more efficient.  The more quickly I can produce quality work with the help of AI, the more I can focus on contributing in other ways and gaining more experience on the job.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on viewing AI as a tool for efficiency that allows you to focus on other contributions, and how you maintain your expertise to collaborate effectively with it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. I have shared everything I can think of.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach to curriculum development, your strategies for getting more creative outputs, and how you balance efficiency with maintaining expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
