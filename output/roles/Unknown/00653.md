Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: None.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to find information about setting up and troubleshooting phones, SIP issues, and VoIP concepts.

AI: That sounds like you're working in telecommunications or IT support. Tell me more about how you use AI for those phone and VoIP troubleshooting tasks - what does that process typically look like for you?

User: An example could be if there was an error message on a Yealink W60B I was unfamiliar with, or setting up DSS keys on a VVX and finding the instructions.

AI: I see - so you're turning to AI when you encounter specific technical challenges or need step-by-step guidance. When you get that error message or need those setup instructions, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you describe the problem and let it provide a complete solution, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation as you work through the issue?

User: It's conversational. I'll provide the error and then guide the AI through how it initially appeared and what I'm attempting with clients to provide context.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really useful for complex technical issues. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI - are there certain troubleshooting tasks or technical work you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: AI can't interact with my platform, so everything I do with it is informational only and gathering research and data on what I'm currently working on.

AI: Ah, that makes perfect sense - the AI provides the knowledge and guidance, but you're the one actually implementing the solutions on your systems. 

Given that limitation, how do you typically decide when to turn to AI for that informational support versus using other resources like documentation, forums, or maybe asking colleagues? What drives that choice for you?

User: If I'm asking AI then it's not within the internal documentation or company dialogue history, and it'd be too obscure for a teammate to know.

AI: So AI becomes your go-to for those really specific or uncommon technical issues that fall outside your usual knowledge base. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team use it similarly, or is there any particular stance your workplace has taken on AI tools?

User: They were the ones who initially suggested it. I never thought about using AI at work until my supervisor said it can be a useful resource for these things.

AI: That's interesting that your supervisor actually introduced you to the idea. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated is when I ask it for information on setting something up in a phone and it makes up that setting. "Look for something like [REDACTED] in the [REDACTED]". There isn't an exact setting called whatever I'm looking for, but instead of searching the manuals and letting me know it pretends like it's there and wastes my time.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - having to double-check whether the AI is giving you accurate information or essentially making things up. When those situations happen where the AI provides incorrect details, how do you typically handle it? Do you go back to the AI to clarify, or do you switch to other resources at that point?

User: I ask it for the actual setting name and directory, and to provide proof of where this exists. Usually it will confirm that it's making things up and I'll need to just Google things myself.

AI: So you've developed a way to push back and get the AI to be more honest about what it actually knows versus what it's guessing at. 

How do you think about maintaining your technical skills in areas where AI could potentially provide quick answers? Is staying sharp on VoIP troubleshooting and phone systems something you actively consider, or does the AI support feel more like it's enhancing what you already know?

User: It's more that there's a lot of data to reference that I'm already familiar with. AI is currently weaker than me on these topics and rarely teaches me anything new if ever.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - you're essentially using AI as a faster way to search through information you already understand, rather than as a learning tool. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it potentially getting better at handling these technical domains, or do you think it will continue to serve this more limited reference role for you?

User: It's possible that it might, but in my industry it's unlikely because it's specialized information. AI is lacking in a lot of information for how telecom actually works and which companies are involved in handling those systems. I don't foresee it knowing anything more than can be found in phone manuals and wiki articles.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves more as a specialized search tool rather than a knowledge source, and how you've learned to push back when it provides inaccurate information.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for specialized technical support - especially the challenges with accuracy in niche domains and how you've adapted your approach to verify information - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how this works in practice. Have a great rest of your day!
