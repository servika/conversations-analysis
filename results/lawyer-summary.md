## Representative Insights

### How Lawyers Use AI

1. "I use AI tools for drafting documents, first-pass research, and very rarely analysis. I also use it to explain concepts with which I am unfamiliar, as a first step for pointing me in the right direction"
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

2. "Editing certain types of language (sometimes the phrasing used is not appropriate for Canadian law) or removing unnecessary paragraphs. For briefs/memos, I will usually write the analysis for caselaw precedents myself  or rewrite if the generated content is decent. Caselaw is still a bit of a weakness of most models though"
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

3. "Mostly accuracy. I do enjoy the writing process as I find it is very useful for focussing my thoughts - in order to be able to explain to another person, writing it out myself is very good practice"
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

4. "I try to do things myself with just a little help from AI for the first few attempts, so that I have a decent grasp on the task. Once I feel like I know how to perform that particular task, I can involve AI a bit more. Emails to clients or other lawyers I will always write myself, because I prefer having my own voice/style and I think particularly for clients it adds a personal touch. I do believe that in the near future personal interactions will be of premium value."
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

5. "I tried to use it to bring up precedents for a file I had, regarding an employment contract termination and the appropriate severance. Every single case it brough up was a hallucination to some extent, either totally, or was misnamed, or miscited, or included but utterly irrelevant. Since that time (maybe 8 months ago), the models seem to be better at not generating so many failures"
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

6. "I hope to find a job that requires my physical presence, and to find my niche in personal interactions. To be honest, I do not know that I will remain in the practice of law for my whole career. In the near-future, I will certainly continue to use AI for many of my tasks, probably more and more as it gets better and better."
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

7. "I work as a lawyer in civil litigation. I don't use AI every day, but I do occasionally use it to help me draft and review simple and complex motions or briefs. This includes wording and phrasing for the motions as well as helping me to with initial research steps for legal analysis."
   *— From conversation 00186.md*

8. "Sure! So let's say I have a motion for a continuance that I need to draft. I will think of the arguments that I would like to make in favor of my motion. For example, delay in response from opposing counsel or unanticipated family emergency caused delay in response times, etc. I would then ask AI to please help me find cases in Maryland, (jurisdiction that the case law is needed for) where a continuance was granted due to a a delay caused by opposing counsel's unresponsiveness."
   *— From conversation 00186.md*

9. "Sure. I have felt satisfied mostly when AI has helped me to save so much time because it quickly found relevant statues and or case law and incorporated them accurately and seamlessly into a simple motion. I then only had to spend about 20 - 30 minutes perfecting the motion. This gave me more time to focus on making the motion really perfect and tightening it to be a solid submission versus spending so much time brainstorming, researching, and compiling basic information for a standard motion."
   *— From conversation 00186.md*

10. "I work at a District Attorney's Office. I mainly use AI on Westlaw to find case law or I'll ChatGPT to spell check emails and any work product I may create for my attorneys. I'll also use ChatGPT to make sentences and legal jargon that I read in case law more easy to understand, especially in older case law."
   *— From conversation 00211.md*

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "I don't work as a lawyer, but I am a lawyer and every time I use AI, I think that so much of that profession could be done more efficiently and with less error by AI. It doesn't make me concerned, but it makes me think about my kids and the fields that they should eventually go into."
   *— From conversation 00245.md*

2. "Unlike some colleagues who spend a lot of time worrying about that and ignoring it, I embrace it even if it kind of does feel like training my replacement at times. At the end of the day though, I went to law school and agonized to pass the bar to be able to go to court and be a litigator and not push paper so until there is a justice system which just eliminates human judges and litigation completely (which I know is possible in my lifetime but seems like one of the last possible things that would go) I'm not concerned ultimately about my skills being needed for clients."
   *— From conversation 00402.md*

3. "I am a lawyer so I use AI to suggest clauses for inclusion in contracts, to review contracts and pick out key clauses of concern for our clients, compare two versions of a contract where one hasn't been redlined, to sense check clauses I've drafted and to draft emails to clients."
   *— From conversation 00444.md*

4. "Of course I do. I see AI as an enhancement not a replacement and even if I ask it to draft something for me I will assess it's output critically like I would when reviewing work sent to me by another lawyer. Whilst AI is very good an appearing confident in its answers, I don't just accept it's output at face value. This is also one of the reasons I challenge it to double check things."
   *— From conversation 00444.md*

5. "I am not concerned about it in my line of work because at the end of the day AI is not permitted to draft and submit arguments to court."
   *— From conversation 00561.md*

6. "I worry about confidentiality and data security.  Most of the data I am feeding to the AI is confidential or definitively should not be seen by employees, competitors, etc.  If I'm unsure about something being strictly confidential, I always ask the main partner first because I don't want to break any rules"
   *— From conversation 00789.md*

7. "i really enjoy writing, so sometimes i will just decide to write something myself, especially if i have had good ideas or im particularly interested or excited in the topic. there are also many things that i would love to use ai for but i cant due to confidentiality or ethical concerns. so sometimes i think ai could be really helpful, but my hands are tied"

## Future Perspectives

1. "I try to do things myself with just a little help from AI for the first few attempts, so that I have a decent grasp on the task. Once I feel like I know how to perform that particular task, I can involve AI a bit more. Emails to clients or other lawyers I will always write myself, because I prefer having my own voice/style and I think particularly for clients it adds a personal touch. I do believe that in the near future personal interactions will be of premium value."
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

2. "The better that generative algorithms become, the more people will use and rely on them for everything - from work to advice, to friendships, to content creation. Knowing that there is a real person on the other end of a conversation will probably be something people are willing to pay for. I am thinking about the attitudes people have about the difference between mass-produced widgets and artisanal crafts, or between a conversation with a voicemail machine versus a real person. These attitudes will doubtless play a part in the near-future AI-scape"
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

3. "I hope to find a job that requires my physical presence, and to find my niche in personal interactions. To be honest, I do not know that I will remain in the practice of law for my whole career. In the near-future, I will certainly continue to use AI for many of my tasks, probably more and more as it gets better and better."
   *— From conversation 00165.md*

4. "Typically, AI will give me a string citation for the case law and a short summary of what happened in the case. I will review the various summaries and select the ones I think will be the most helpful. Then copy the citation into my legal research database so that I can locate the case and review the case for the same context. Also if AI uses any quotes, I am reviewing the case to locate those exact quotes and then I am reading the context around those quotes to ensure that everything accurately aligns with the position I want to present."
   *— From conversation 00186.md*

5. "The first thing I can think of is writing emails. I can see the appeal in certain contexts where its really not worth the time and effort... but I'm not a massive fan of the idea that its just bots talking to bots all the time (cynically), or having a bot talk to my client when there are sensitive issues at hand. I think there are still many instances where having that human touch, even if it becomes imperceptible, is just important - maybe its just me, maybe I'll change my mind in the future - but I don't want to completely let go of the human aspect just yet."
   *— From conversation 00398.md*

6. "Well, when an obscure case surfaces in seconds with the help of AI - that's great. Something that would have taken a paralegal (that isn't specialised in the area, at least) some time - billable time at that - to discover, being produced at fraction of the time really helps with efficiency. I don't think AI ever frustrates me much since my expectations are low anyway - but I guess those times were I correct it and it either rebuffs me with the same hallucination or just keeps apologising for mistakes but keeps repeating them... that gets kind of annoying."
   *— From conversation 00398.md*

7. "I think that AI is going to decrease people's reliance on lawyers once people understand how to write the correct prompts. Especially, low income persons who rely on lawyers because they don't understand the law.  A lot of things that people hire lawyers for in their individual capacity, they can truly do themselves."
   *— From conversation 00403.md*

8. "The AI will also provide a summary of the case which I will read first to further eliminate irrelevant cases.  But at the end of the day I still need to read the entire case if I am going to use it in a brief.  To not do so would be unethical in my opinion."
   *— From conversation 00561.md*
