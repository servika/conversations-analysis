Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions go ahead and begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI every workday, usually about once a week or so. I manage and run a donut shop so when I'm looking for new inventory ideas or specific parts that I'm having trouble finding myself, I use AI to help me find what I need. I also ask it basic questions when I'm second guessing a decision, or I ask it to give me both sides to moving forward with something for example.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you use AI more strategically, for specific situations rather than constant support. 

When you say you ask it to give you both sides of moving forward with something, can you tell me more about what that looks like? What kind of decisions are you typically working through?

User: Yeah I'll just give you a specific example. I was debating getting a device necessary to make French Crueller donuts that's fairly pricey for what it is. If I were to move forward with that decision it would also entail buying the more expensive mix, I wasn't sure if it were worth the price point, given the smaller population of where my store is located and the somewhat declining customer base. People have asked for them, but I wasn't sure enough had asked to warrant the purchase and upkeep necessary. I asked AI to give me the benefits of both and which choice it thought I should make. I thought about it myself, keeping it's analysis in mind and I decided not to purchase the part just yet.

AI: That's a really concrete example - thank you. It sounds like AI helped you think through a business decision by laying out the considerations, but you ultimately made the call yourself.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Honestly no, for a good portion of tasks aside from customer service I'd be glad to hand off to AI if it were feasible.

AI: That's refreshingly honest! So it sounds like feasibility is the main barrier rather than a preference to keep certain tasks for yourself.

When you do use AI for work - like with that French Cruller decision or finding inventory - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and let it handle things independently?

User: I tend to think about whatever I'd ask the AI myself first, and right before I make the final decision I sort of "double check" my thoughts through the AI to make sure I'm not missing any details for example. It's typically after I've thought it through but before I take action all up front.

AI: So you use it more as a final checkpoint - almost like having a business advisor review your thinking before you commit. That's a really thoughtful approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're running a donut shop, I'm curious about whether other business owners you know are using AI, or if there are any conversations about it in your industry?

User: They haven't influenced my way of using AI. The business owners near me don't use AI as it's not necessary for the services they provide, and the topic rarely comes up. Even for myself I normally think things through myself first so AI is more of a handy tool at the moment rather than a huge help that I'd be talking to business owners about.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like AI is more of a personal resource for you rather than something that's part of broader industry conversations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was satisfied when it helped me decide which Monster Energy flavor would likely be best for me to stock on my shelves after removing one earlier in the year given my location. I don't use it for anything important enough to feel frustrated about.

AI: That's a good example of AI helping with a practical inventory decision. You mentioned that you don't use it for anything important enough to feel frustrated about - that suggests you have a pretty clear sense of what kinds of decisions you trust AI with versus ones you don't.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I actively consider and I'm not worried, given this is somewhat of a family run business. We have the final say so and we can delegate what we do and don't want to AI as it gets better and better. That being said I do think it's a little scary for others in situations unlike mine.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - recognizing that your situation as a family business owner gives you more control than others might have. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll be using it more frequently or for different types of tasks as it develops?

User: I envision it staying the same until there's a point where you can buy small machines/robots to do repetitive tasks for cheap. An example of this is folding boxes, I've folded countless and don't enjoy it. Other that that and other small things I enjoy the work I do and in my personal situation don't believe we'd ever delegate more than like 5% of tasks to AI.

AI: That's really helpful - you have a clear vision of where the boundaries would be for your business. It sounds like you'd welcome AI for the truly repetitive tasks you don't enjoy, but you value the hands-on work that makes up most of what you do.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described using AI as a "double check" before making decisions - that's a really strategic way to leverage it while maintaining your own judgment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing other than that I might consider using an AI voice for certain things in the future if the technology gets better. Currently you can tell 99/100 times when a voice is AI.

AI: That's a great addition - the quality of AI voices is definitely still a barrier for customer-facing applications. It sounds like once that technology improves, you might see some different use cases opening up.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically as a decision-making checkpoint, and your perspective on maintaining control while being open to efficiency gains, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about your approach!
