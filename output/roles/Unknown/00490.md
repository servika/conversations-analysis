Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to summarize and organize notes, create outlines and drafts for reports, and to generate ideas for marketing and business development. I also use it for background research on clients and projects.

AI: That's a nice range of applications. When you mention using it for background research on clients and projects, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: For example, if we are putting together a proposal for a project, I might ask AI to prepare a background report on the county, city, university, hospital, etc.

AI: That sounds like it saves you quite a bit of time. When you get that background report back from AI, what do you typically do with it? Do you use it as-is, or does it become a starting point for something else?

User: It becomes a starting point. I usually ask the AI to include links to sources so I can make sure the information is correct. I usually transform whatever the AI produces into my own style of report.

AI: That verification step you mentioned is interesting. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to verify any information I get through AI for correctness. I've noticed that sometimes AI references outdated information, or confuses similar terms or people. I like to make sure that anything being used in a marketing effort is correct.

AI: That makes a lot of sense, especially for marketing materials where accuracy is crucial. Beyond that verification piece, are there other types of work tasks that you prefer to keep for yourself rather than involving AI at all?

User: I use Excel a lot at work. In the past I've tried using AI to help me write formulas, but it doesn't seem to do a good job. So I handle anything in Excel myself.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually collaborate with it. I am wary of just copy-pasting results from AI. The only time I fully delegate a task to it is for organizing notes.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds very deliberate. When you say you collaborate with it, can you walk me through what that back-and-forth typically looks like? For instance, when you're working on one of those reports or outlines?

User: I would say something like, "give me some demographic information about XYZ county, with an eye towards XYZ project that we are working on". Then I would review the info, and ask follow up questions like, "what can you tell me about similar projects in that county?" Basically just asking follow up questions.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes, definitely. My workplace culture has changed a lot over the last two years to go from wary of AI to trying to integrate it more and more. A lot of the initial skepticism has worn off. I feel more comfortable using it now.

AI: That's a significant shift. What do you think helped move your workplace from that initial wariness to being more accepting? Was it particular experiences or something else?

User: Once some of the higher level principals/shareholders saw how it could save time and improve momentum, it became more accepted.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have been using AI recently to help me write a 'white paper'. It helped me develop interview questions for staff I was interviewing, focus the intent of the paper, and even create an outline. Normally this type of task would get put on the backburner because of all the background tasks involved. AI helped me get some traction.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience - getting traction on something that might have otherwise stalled. On the flip side, have you had any particularly frustrating moments when working with AI?

User: Yes, as I mentioned before, I wish it was better at Excel. I have to process certain reports in Excel, and it's very tedious and time consuming. I wish that AI could help with those tasks, but it struggles with the report format generated by my software and it can't really write useful Excel formulas, even with multiple rounds of iteration.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I can't really see AI taking over my job. My work is too varied and there is a lot of interpersonal information that must be applied.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Yes, I hope I can leverage it more confidently. I'd like to work on creating custom models that are tailored to my workplace.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how workplace culture shifted once leadership saw the time-saving benefits, and how you've found AI helpful for getting momentum on projects that might otherwise get stuck.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach you take, the importance of verification, and how workplace acceptance has evolved will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
