Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I rarely use AI at my work. I work in social care. Occasionally I will use it identify objects or products by taking a picture of the thing I want to know about such as by asking "What is this?".

I may also use it for brainstorming activities that suit the needs of people I support. For example I might ask "I'm looking for activities in my local area that would be good for someone with learning disabilities and mobility issues. They love sensory things like lights and music."

AI: That's really interesting - you've found some specific, targeted ways to use AI even though it's not a big part of your daily routine. 

When you do use AI for those brainstorming sessions about activities for the people you support, how do you typically work with it? Do you tend to ask one question and work with what it gives you, or do you find yourself going back and forth to refine the suggestions?

User: I would probably go back and forth to refine the suggestions, and I would double check online that the information about the activities is up to date. If one activity in particular sounds like a good fit I might ask it to suggest more things like that activity or to go into more detail about the activity. For example, I might ask if there are any good reviews that specifically mention things like how the activity is great fun for people with mobility issues or people who like sensory experiences.

AI: That back-and-forth refinement process sounds really thoughtful. You're essentially using it as a starting point and then building on what works.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your social care work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I wouldn't say that I prefer to handle things myself rather than use AI, but some task are very practical and I can't see how AI would fit into the task. For example, administering medication.

 Other tasks such as paperwork that involve counting money and medication could certainly be improved with AI but this would also require the company to introduce things like tablet computers to replace paperwork. I do the paperwork simply because it is out of my control to be able to introduce AI into the workflow.

If I am planning an itinerary for a day out at work, I would probably do this myself rather than use AI unless I didn't have any ideas for what to do. I suppose I haven't considered that using AI might lead me to find more activities or locations to visit, so I might start using it for this purpose.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - between tasks where AI physically can't help versus tasks where the infrastructure just isn't there yet, versus tasks where you simply haven't thought to try it.

You mentioned that your company would need to introduce changes like tablet computers for AI to help with certain workflows. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Is it something people talk about or is it more of an individual choice?

User: There has not been much influence from my colleagues or my workplace culture about using AI. Most of the upper management are older and not particularly tech savvy. My colleagues never use AI in their day to day work. 

It is not something we discuss at work, it is more of an individual choice.

AI: It sounds like you're really operating independently when it comes to AI use - you're figuring out what works for you without much organizational guidance or peer influence.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used AI to brainstorm activities for someone I support and found that it was useful for finding ideas that met the needs of the person. 

Myself and colleagues were trying to brainstorm our own ideas and using AI to help with this was just an idea that I had.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience - AI helping you come up with ideas that actually worked well for the person you were supporting. 

I'm curious about something you touched on earlier. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? For instance, with that brainstorming example - is this something you actively consider, or does it not really concern you?

User: It's 50/50. By analogy, it's good to have a calculator but it's also good to be able to do arithmetic. The calculator is just faster. 

I am happy to use AI as an extension of my own abilities or as a learning tool but I am less keen on the idea of losing skills I already have or relying too much on AI without thinking critically about what it provides.

AI: That's a really balanced way to think about it - AI as an extension rather than a replacement. The calculator analogy is quite apt.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, or do you think it will stay pretty much at the current level?

User: I think it depends on the decisions made by the company. If we switched from paperwork to using devices like tablets or phones then I could see AI becoming a useful tool in my workplace. This really depends on things like funding rather than how good AI might be.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as an extension of abilities rather than a replacement, and how organizational infrastructure really shapes what's possible.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of! Thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into social care work - from the practical brainstorming uses to the infrastructure barriers - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
