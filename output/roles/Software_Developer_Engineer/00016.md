Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I have two main interests when it comes to project work, web-development and Android app development. I'm currently working on an Android project.

AI: That's really interesting! Tell me more about this Android project you're currently working on - what does it involve and what does your process typically look like from start to finish?

User: I'm a solo developer for this project, so I'm involved in every aspect of development, from planning, to development, testing, etc.

AI: That's a lot to manage on your own! Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools across all those different phases - the planning, development, testing, and so on?

User: I have to really utilize AI in the planning stages, as the ideas already exist. What I've found thus far is that AI fills the gaps when official documentation doesn't meet my needs.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - AI filling the gaps where documentation falls short. Can you give me a specific example of a recent situation where you hit one of those documentation gaps and turned to AI? What was the problem you were trying to solve and how did AI help you through it?

User: At first, I put a considerable amount of time and effort into scouring through Google's official documentation for modern Android development, however, as I continued in the earliest stages of product planning and development, I learned that my time was better served utilizing AI to help answer questions about my project.

AI: That shift sounds significant - moving from spending considerable time with official docs to leaning more on AI. What made you realize that AI was a better use of your time? Was there a particular moment or experience that made that click for you?

User: I think its important to note that I have years of experience with coding, but not much experience with Android. By that, I mean, compared to someone who might be considered very skilled. Thus, I began to realize early on that AI was very capable of assisting with ensuring that I understood the basic concepts, kept my data layer and UI layer separate, helped to ensure that my files would work together, and most importantly, assisting with debugging and errors.

AI: That's a really helpful distinction - having the coding foundation but being newer to Android specifically. When you're working with AI on these tasks - whether it's explaining concepts, helping with architecture, or debugging - how would you describe that collaboration? Who's making the creative and technical decisions in that process?

User: Ultimately, I make the decisions, but I've utilized AI quite a bit in providing suggestions. When a suggestion doesn't work out the way it was expected, I just try a different approach. I also use a few different AI models to get comparisons.

AI: That's smart - using multiple AI models for comparison. When you say you make the ultimate decisions, can you tell me more about how you evaluate AI suggestions? What helps you decide whether to go with an AI's recommendation or try a different approach?

User: As a learner, its essentially trial and error. However, because I do have the coding background, I can grasp the code pretty quickly.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - your coding background gives you that foundation to quickly assess what AI suggests, even in a new domain like Android. What aspects of your development work have changed the most since you started using AI this way? How does your workflow now compare to how you might have tackled learning a new platform before AI was available?

User: Honestly, in the past, I may have eventually given up on projects because I'd hit a wall and sometimes life has other priorities. With the help of AI however, I've gotten much farther in the process than in the past and I can actually see myself completing this project.

AI: That's a really powerful impact - the difference between potentially giving up and actually seeing yourself completing the project. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in development work more broadly?

User: I do have concerns. It's an extremely tough job market, and AI is only a part of the reason for the difficulty graduates face. If you want me to be completely honest, I'm not a huge fan of using AI in lieu of actual customer service, simply because it allows a company an 'out' for not solving issues for its paying customers.

AI: I appreciate that honesty - that's a really important perspective about how AI implementation can sometimes serve corporate interests over customer needs. When you think about your own development work specifically, do you see any ways that AI's growing presence might impact opportunities or expectations in your field, either positively or negatively?

User: I do. There was a time when knowing how to 'code' was prestigious. It takes years to become proficient and a person who spent that time learning was rewarded, however,  it seems as if anyone can now jump online and grab some code. In fact, this is one reason why I am now focusing on my own side-projects in an attempt to create something that may be marketable.

AI: That shift in how coding is perceived - from prestigious to more accessible - is really significant. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your relationship with AI tools will change as you become more experienced with Android development?

User: Even though I have my concerns, I am a nerd at heart. I love tech and will continue to utilize it. I'm looking forward to a time when an AI model can output graphic representations for the UI layers in our work product.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your development process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you push through walls that might have stopped projects in the past, and your honest take on both the opportunities and challenges AI creates in the field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your development work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not at the moment!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a gap-filler for documentation, the impact on project completion, and the changing landscape for developers will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative and technical contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and concerns - that balanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the real-world impact of these tools. Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your Android project!
