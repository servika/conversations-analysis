Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a physical therapist, my most common use of AI is in written communication with patients, physicians, parents, coaches, etc. I often ask AI to help me draft professional letters to the intended audience, leaving out personal information of course. I also sometimes use AI to ask general/medical questions about topics or conditions I do not often see in the clinic so that I get a quick refresher.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helps you with both communication and knowledge refresh. When you're drafting those professional letters, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you give AI a rough outline of what you want to say, or do you approach it differently?

User: Yeah I basically just give a quick overview of what I need and add any specific details. For example, I might ask AI to draft a sample letter from a physical therapist to a football coach requesting that a patient be exempt from upper body weight lifting due to an elbow injury. After that, I add in the details and any names/contact info myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having AI create the professional structure and tone, then you personalize it with the specific details. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The only task I can think of that I prefer to do myself is in drafting personalized emails to patients. If I'm following up with a patient via email, I prefer the email to sound like it is coming from me, so I like to add personal touches such as "have a great night with Fido!" or something similar so that the patient knows that I care about. AI would not be able to add those personal touches. Otherwise, if AI can help make my life easier at work, I'll definite utilize it!

AI: That's a great distinction - the personal touches that show you really know and care about each patient. It sounds like those human connections are something you want to keep authentic.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate and make changes as we go.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration process. What does it look like when you're working back and forth with AI on something?

User: I'll ask the AI to write a draft, then I may ask it to make revisions or take out a specific word, etc.

AI: That iterative approach sounds efficient - getting the initial draft and then refining it together. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My boss is really into AI and uses it quite frequently himself, which encourages me to use it more. Some of my colleagues are skeptical of using AI in the workplace as they feel it can take away from our expertise as clinicians. Their skepticism does not affect my use of AI as I recognize that it is an asset.

AI: It's interesting how you have that mix of perspectives around you - your boss encouraging it while some colleagues are more cautious. You mentioned recognizing AI as an asset despite the skepticism. What specifically makes you see it that way when others might worry about it affecting clinical expertise?

User: So much of my day as a physical therapist is documenting. Whether that is writing a patient note, evaluation, or communication with other healthcare professionals, documentation takes up at least 25% of my day. That is time that I am not able to spend one on one with patients helping them feel better. If AI can help me spend more time with my patients and decrease my documentation time, I am all for it!

AI: That's a powerful perspective - using AI to free up more time for direct patient care. It sounds like you see it as enhancing rather than replacing your clinical work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Most of the time, I am satisfied when using AI at work. When writing professional letters, they always sound and look better when I use AI to assist. When asking questions about conditions, medications, or other information that I need a refresher on, I receive succinct and accurate information that helps me better understand and treat each patient. I do not remember a time that I have been frustrated.

AI: That's really positive feedback - it sounds like AI has been consistently helpful in your experience. You mentioned that the professional letters "always sound and look better" with AI assistance. What specifically makes them better compared to when you write them entirely yourself?

User: AI helps me come up with more professional ways to get my ideas across. It also helps me to create the appropriate headings for professional letters.

AI: That makes sense - having AI help with the professional language and structure while you provide the clinical knowledge and personal touches. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: In my job, I don't think that AI could take over my skills. Much of what I do is hands on with the patient, so I don't think this will be an issue.

AI: That's a good point about the hands-on nature of physical therapy. Since your direct patient care involves that physical, in-person component, it sounds like you see AI more as a support tool rather than something that could replace core aspects of your work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I have heard of physicians using AI to create documentation for them. At this time, we do not have the option for this in our documentation system. However, moving forward, I believe that AI will be able to listen in on evaluations and create documents for me so that I can focus on the patient and not be typing/writing notes while communicating with them.

AI: That vision of AI handling documentation in real-time while you focus completely on the patient sounds like it would really enhance that direct care you value. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you spend more time with patients by reducing documentation burden.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No! We covered everything.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI to enhance patient care rather than replace clinical skills, and how it helps free up time for what matters most in your work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
