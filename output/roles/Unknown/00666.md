Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Okay that sounds good, I am ready to start.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI very often, but when I do it mostly to help write and reply to emails.

AI: Tell me more about that. What is it about email writing and replies that makes you turn to AI for help?

User: I use it to help me properly organize the content of the email, and sometimes to help make sure the tone remains professional. For longer emails I also use it to help keep the emails concise without loosing any important information.

AI: That's helpful context. When you're working on these emails with AI, how does that process typically unfold? Do you draft something first and then ask for help refining it, or do you start the conversation with AI from scratch?

User: I usually draft an email first then ask for help from AI.

AI: What makes you decide to keep certain email tasks for yourself rather than having AI handle them completely? Are there types of emails you prefer to write entirely on your own?

User: If the emails are more personal in nature I prefer to write them myself.

AI: Can you give me an example of what you mean by "more personal in nature"? What distinguishes those emails from the ones where you're comfortable using AI assistance?

User: Emails about personal time off or sick leave. Or if someone is sharing information with me about life outside of the workplace setting, or if I am writing an email requiring myself to share such details.

AI: That makes sense. I'm curious about your workplace environment - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about using these tools, or is it something you've approached more independently?

User: In my workplace I don't think AI tools are used very much. My colleagues do not really mention their use of AI tools. I have chosen to use it independently, although it is not often.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI for work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I needed to write an email expressing some concerns about my return to work after taking an extended leave. I had many questions and it was quite overwhelming, so I used AI to help me properly organize questions and thoughts while keeping the tone professional, and to help keep the email from getting too long. I was quite satisfied with the outcome, as my employer responded well to my concerns.

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful outcome. When you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially help - like writing or communication - is this something you actively consider? How do you think about that balance?

User: I haven't given much thought to it, but in general I don't want to completely rely on AI for all my writing and communication needs. As I am always trying to improve my own skills. However at times using AI can help me with ideas on how to phrase things, or organize emails for the future so I may not always have to ask for help with certain things.

AI: That's an interesting way to think about it - using AI as a learning tool for future situations. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or more frequently as time goes on?

User: For the time being, I don't see my use of AI changing very much. I am pretty comfortable with the way I am using it now. And I am not sure if my employer plans to use or implement any AI tools into our day to day operations and tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning tool - how it can help you with ideas for phrasing and organizing that you might apply in future situations without needing assistance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think I have anything else to share.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI selectively - particularly for organizing thoughts and maintaining professional tone while keeping more personal communications entirely your own - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
