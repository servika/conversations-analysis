Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a visual artist who specialises in textiles art, and so my work flow consists of conceptualising ideas, designing artworks and then executing these designs. There is also a fair bit of admin involved, for example if I am working with galleries who want to exhibit my work or individuals commissioning my work. Alongside this, I run a TikTok account documenting my processes and life in general. This has started to become a source of income for me within the past 6 months and also falls under the scope of creative work. For my TikTok videos, I have to come up with catchy concepts, film and then edit and post.

AI: That's fascinating - you have such a diverse creative practice spanning from the tactile world of textiles to the digital realm of social media. It sounds like you're juggling quite a few different creative processes.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I try to keep AI out of the actual "making" process of my work to be honest because I want it to completely be my own. However, I will use it for basic admin tasks and occasionally to brainstorm. For example, I might use it to help me come up with captions and hashtags to use on my social media, or drafting emails.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you have a clear boundary between where AI does and doesn't belong in your process. 

Tell me more about that brainstorming piece. What does that look like when you use AI to brainstorm?

User: The brainstorming aspect mainly comes into play in relation to social media. For example, if I have an idea for a video but am struggling to think of a catchy opening line then I might turn to an AI chatbot to help.

AI: I see - so it's really focused on that social media content creation side rather than your textile art concepts themselves.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Most recently I used AI to help brainstorm an idea for a brand deal video that I made for TikTok. The brand deal was for a supermarket and I wanted to come up with a way to work this organically into my regular content, which is based around textiles and fashion. The conversation was short, I just asked it to generate a few basic ideas and then I used them as starting points to come up with my own concept. I never just use an idea that AI has come up with for social media, I always work it and add my own flair

AI: That's a great example of how you maintain creative control while using AI as a starting point. It sounds like you have a pretty intentional approach to keeping your own voice and perspective central.

When you're working with AI in those brainstorming moments, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: When I use AI for brainstorming, I am the one in control. I see it as a tool to introduce me to ideas that I may have not thought about, and then I can follow threads that interest me. It is kind of like an alternative for group crits when I don't have anyone around to talk to my ideas about. A group crit is a term used in art school - it is when a group of you get together and share your ideas and talk through them together, and can give each other new ideas as a result.

AI: That's such a helpful analogy - thinking of AI as a substitute for group crits when you need that external perspective. It really highlights how you're using it as a sounding board rather than a creative driver.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think that it helps to speed up the conceptualising aspect of the process, so I can spend more time actually making things (which is my favourite part)

AI: That's really valuable - getting more time for the hands-on making that you love most.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am concerned about generate AI taking jobs from creatives altogether, we have already seen it happening with AI generated adverts appearing in Vogue. Obviously AI can't sew and reproduce the exact textiles art that I make (yet!) but it can generate images of textiles and is only getting more sophisticated

AI: That's a very real concern - the threat to creative livelihoods is something many artists are grappling with right now. The fact that you mention "yet" suggests you're thinking this could evolve further.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think that I will still keep it at a distance and don't see myself integrating it any further into my artistic practice, but could see myself using it to streamline more of the admin side such as emails and taxes and things like that

AI: That makes a lot of sense given how clearly you've defined those boundaries between the creative core of your work and the business side.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI like a group crit - that analogy really illuminated how you maintain agency while still getting external input, and how intentional you are about keeping AI out of the actual making process that you're most passionate about.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative boundaries while strategically using AI for support tasks, and that wonderful group crit analogy, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've found ways to preserve what's most important to you - that hands-on making process - while still benefiting from AI's capabilities where they genuinely serve your work. Thank you so much!
