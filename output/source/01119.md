Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! Let's begin!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a board game designer. I am also a creative writer, focusing on poetry, short fiction, and personal narrative essays.

AI: That's a fascinating combination! Board games and creative writing both involve such rich storytelling and world-building elements.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: For board game design, I use AI to help me create layouts for prototype components like cards, player boards, and shared boards. I also use AI to help create concept placeholder art for the prototyping and Playtesting stages of the design. For my creating writing, I use AI for proofreading and editing.

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI differently across those two creative domains - more for visual and layout support in board games versus editorial assistance in writing.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Sure, I recently attended a board game design convention where participants played each other's games. I used AI to help create a placeholder cover for my game - something eye-catching that helped visually represent what the game was about and attract players to my table. This actually wound up taking quite a bit of time because the AI had difficulty with certain parameters like layering text on an image. This was frustrating and I wound up using AI to create the representative image while creating the text myself.

AI: That's a great example of both the potential and the limitations showing up in the same project. It sounds like the AI was helpful for the core visual concept but struggled with the more technical aspects of design integration.

When you're working with AI in situations like that - whether it's the board game layouts or your writing editing - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I feel like I am driving the decisions because I have a clear idea in my head and am directing the AI to help create a usable document based on that idea. It's often challenging to get AI to respond the way I envision, though, and I am often left with a final product that I have to "settle" for. But since it's just a placeholder, it works for my purposes.

AI: That's really insightful - this sense of having a clear vision but sometimes needing to compromise on the execution. You mentioned this settling feeling with placeholders, which works fine for prototyping.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I love the creative aspects of both board game design and creative writing. But I'm not so much a fan of the tedious steps of building a physical prototype in board game design or proofreading in creative writing. AI helps me get through steps like that without feeling overwhelmed and helpless so I can spend more time on the actual creative parts of the processes.

AI: That's such a valuable perspective - AI helping you move through the less enjoyable but necessary parts so you can focus on what you're passionate about. It sounds like it's acting as a kind of creative enabler rather than a creative collaborator.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have huge ethical concerns about using AI for the actual creative steps of these endeavors. I would never use AI to generate a game idea for me or write a story. I think it's useful for fillling in knowledge gaps - like adding visuals and graphic design to a prototype or proofreading creative writing. But I think that's as far as it should go. There is huge public backlash in the board game community for publishers that publish a final product of a game with AI art, and I think that's appropriate. There are people in book publishing making money by having AI write books for them and I think that's both both morally wrong and leads to an inferior product. I don't think AI is a substitute for human inspiration and creative expression.

AI: Your distinction between using AI to fill knowledge gaps versus replace creative expression is really compelling. It sounds like you see a clear line between AI as a tool for execution versus AI as a source of creative ideas.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Unless AI companies find a way to lessen the environmental impact of AI, I think AI may ultimately be a passing fad. The excessive use of power and energy and creation of pollution in current AI is unsustainable. AI companies need to adapt to these realities or there won't be anything for them to adapt to in the future. But if companies are able to adapt and make their environmental impact negligible, then I could see AI becoming a mainstream and accepted tool like a quicker and more efficient Grammar Check on Word. I'm not sure if LLMs are the future - smaller scale, individually packaged systems for specific fields and uses may be more appropriate and effective.

AI: That's a really thoughtful long-term view - connecting the practical utility you've experienced with broader sustainability concerns and thinking about more targeted applications.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between AI as a tool for execution versus creative generation, and how you see it helping you focus on the parts of your work you're most passionate about.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that will be all!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative enabler rather than a creative replacement, along with your thoughtful perspective on the ethical boundaries and environmental considerations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated how clearly you articulated the distinction between the tedious execution tasks where AI adds value versus the core creative work that you feel should remain fundamentally human. That's exactly the kind of nuanced understanding we're hoping to learn from creative professionals like yourself.

Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your board game designs and writing projects!
