Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use AI to help me when I run into a problem that I'm struggling with. I will take the issue to AI and see if it can help me solve it. Usually this is for coding projects using SQL or VBA.

AI: That's really interesting - so it sounds like AI serves as a problem-solving resource when you hit roadblocks. 

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're stuck on one of these SQL or VBA coding issues?

User: Usually I have a project or task that I'm working on and I will come across an issue that I can't solve after a few attempts. I will then ask AI (usaully Copilot) if there is a way to code for a certain desired outcome. For example I will ask it something like, "How do you have a VBA code loop through visible cells?". If the help that it provides still doesn't help me with my problem I will then submit my code to and AI platform and describe the desired outcome/function I want my code to perform.

AI: That progression makes a lot of sense - starting with the general question and then getting more specific with your actual code. 

Tell me more about that second step when you submit your actual code. What does that interaction typically look like?

User: I will copy and paste my current code and explain what my code is attempting to do and the issues that I am having with it, whether that's error messages or output inaccuracies. I will ask it to modify to code so that I can have the desired output.

AI: That's a clear process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on these coding problems. 

Are there certain types of coding tasks or situations where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help? What makes those different from the ones where you do reach out for AI assistance?

User: I prefer to only reach out to AI after I've attempted to solve the problem myself. I personally like problem solving, it's fun and relaxing for me, so I only ask for AI help once I feel like I've exhausted my problem solving skills. I don't like to use AI for tasks or problems that I could do myself because I don't want to lose my problem solving skills and become dependent on AI to tell me how to do everything.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - wanting to preserve your own problem-solving abilities while still leveraging AI when you need it.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it throughout the task. I usually present it with my problem and ask it for help solving the problem. There's usually a little back and forth as once I overcome one hurdle there's often another one that pops up, or I might need to modify the code to account for some other variable.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth sounds like a natural workflow. It's interesting how new challenges emerge as you work through the original problem.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My boss is an extremely huge advocate for the use of AI. He is constantly showing/telling us different ways that he uses it and encourages us to use it all the time. He uses it all the time in his daily life, not just at work or for work tasks. The rest of my coworkers are more similar to the way I use it, we turn to it as a resource when we need it for a problem or a task, but don't think about incorporating in into work routines or on a regular basis.

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - having a boss who's pushing AI integration while you and your coworkers take a more selective approach.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I was tasked with cleaning up a dataset that had over 200 columns and over 500k rows. It was an extremely large dataset, but we only needed a small amount of columns for the calculation to actually work. I was trying to figure out a way to create a flag for each column if it is used in any of the calculations that we have, but it quickly became very messy as certain columns referenced each other or were dependent on other columns to determine it's value. After a few hours of struggling with this approach I decided to put all of the calculations into Copilot and ask it to provide me with a list of all of the datapoints that were used in them. It provided me a list and I was able to then create a query that filtered out the unnecessary columns make it so that the workbooks handling our calculations ran much faster as it didn't have to parse near as much data. I was pretty happy with it because it provided my the correct list first time which I didn't expect, I expected to have a little back and forth with it, but it got them all first time. I was also happy because I felt like it was a huge daunting mess that I was struggling to work through and starting to dread, but it made it very easy to finish the task.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying experience - turning what was becoming a dreaded, messy task into something manageable. It's interesting that it got the list right on the first try when you were expecting more back-and-forth.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't thought about it much. My boss said that some CEO was quoted saying something like, "AI isn't going to take your job, someone that knows how to use AI will". I feel like in my company at least there is a lot of changes and ad hoc stuff that needs done that I feel like AI would still need someone to at least supervise it if it were to take over the role I do, so I haven't worried about it and just keep learning and figuring things out as normal. I wouldn't say that I consider whether or not AI could replace the skill when I'm learning something.

AI: That's a pragmatic perspective - focusing on the supervisory role and all the ad hoc work that comes up. It sounds like you're not letting concerns about AI replacement change how you approach learning new things.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm not entirely sure, I'm pretty satisfied with the way that I currently use it. I could see it being helpful in clearing out some of the smaller mundane/repetitive tasks that I have, but I don't see it currently becoming more than a more interactive google that can handle some small tasks I don't want to deal with. I'll probably keep using it as a search function for help in the near future, though I will admit that I'm not the most up to date on AI's capabilities.

AI: That makes sense - viewing it as an enhanced search tool that can also handle some of the tasks you'd rather not deal with yourself.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to preserve your problem-solving skills while still leveraging AI strategically when you hit roadblocks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a problem-solving resource after exhausting your own attempts, and that collaborative back-and-forth approach, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
