Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have some veggies and fruits I need to use up tomorrow and I'm looking for ways to make medleys for the salad bar that look both appetizing and will entice elementary aged students to take at least a half a cup of one more both.

AI: I appreciate you sharing that with me, but I think there might be a bit of confusion here. I'm actually conducting a research interview today about how people use AI tools in their work, rather than providing assistance with meal planning.

However, your question does give me an interesting window into how you might use AI at work! It sounds like you work in food service for elementary students - is that right? 

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Yes, I work in an elementary school kitchen. I use AI for things like meal planning, specifically meals I can make that cater to the several special diet types I have (gluten-free and halal). I also use it to help me with figuring out what food and supplies I need to order.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. It sounds like AI is playing a practical role in helping you navigate the complexity of meal planning with multiple dietary requirements and supply management.

When you're working on these meal planning tasks, can you walk me through how you typically interact with the AI? Do you find yourself going back and forth with it to refine ideas, or do you usually give it all the requirements upfront and let it generate complete meal plans for you?

User: When I am on a time constraint I like to give it all the instructions up front. For example, providing the ingredients I have in the kitchen and asking for help figuring out what to make. When I have more time I love conversing back and forth and getting ideas on ways to season or ways I can present it so it's more "fun" for the students. For ordering, it's really an ongoing conversation over multiple days. It keeps track of what I have and will help by asking if what I'm serving the next few days lines up with what I already have. Suggestions are provided on supplies I may need to order.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you've developed different interaction styles depending on your time constraints and the complexity of what you're trying to accomplish.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your kitchen work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: These are really the only things I am able to use AI for, but it is a major help for me.

AI: I understand - so AI is helping you with some key areas, but there are limits to where it can be useful in your work environment.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? For instance, are other kitchen staff or administrators supportive of you using these tools, or is it something you mostly keep to yourself?

User: I do not inform others of this because I think it may be frowned upon. I'm not sure they would be too excited about me not thinking for myself.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're navigating some uncertainty about how others might perceive AI use in your role.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was feeling very overwhelmed at work one day and did not have the brainpower or energy to put a lot of effort into the following day's prep. The AI took care of my meal planning, which it does anyway, but I felt especially grateful for it on that day.

AI: That sounds like AI provided real support when you needed it most. It's interesting how the same tool can feel especially valuable depending on your circumstances that day.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI is helping you - like meal planning or supply ordering? Is this something you actively consider, or does it feel more like AI is enhancing what you already know how to do?

User: AI is enhancing it. It does make me more excited to come into work as well.

AI: That's wonderful to hear that it's making you more excited about coming to work. That says a lot about how AI can positively impact the day-to-day experience of a job.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it in new ways, or expanding how you currently use it?

User: I think it will stay how it is for now.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as an enhancement to your existing skills and how it helped you through that overwhelming day - that really illustrates the supportive role it can play.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for meal planning with special dietary requirements, the different ways you interact with it depending on your time constraints, and how it provides support during challenging days will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty about navigating workplace perceptions around AI use as well - that's an important dynamic we're trying to understand better.

Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with tomorrow's meal preparations!
