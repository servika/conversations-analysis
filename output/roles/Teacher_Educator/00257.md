Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use AI to help me come up with ideas for lesson plans. I teach a lot of levels of the same subject, so it can help me figure out ways to deliver the same topic to different age ranges or skill levels. I have also started using an AI program for student writing and feedback

AI: That sounds like you've found some really practical applications for AI in your teaching. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for adapting topics across different levels - what does that process actually look like for you?

User: Usually I will enter the topic of the lesson plan (for example subject-verb agreement) to see what sort of result I get. If it feels workable, I then ask for differentiation in the lesson plan to be suited towards absolute beginners/young students, new learners, intermediate review, and then advanced review.

AI: That's a systematic approach. When you get those differentiated lesson plans back from AI, what do you typically do with them? Do you use them as-is, or do you find yourself modifying them in certain ways?

User: I usually modify them to fit the vocabulary needs of my students. Sometimes I will ask for a number of example sentences my students can use in class. Even if I don't use the exact, word-for-word sentences given, there can be a good level of variation which I retain in the materials I use.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer grading to be something I do on my own. I know that there are a lot of AI tools that help with writing, but I need to be realistic about what skills I want my students to learn. If they are using AI to assist with their writing (either with or without permission), what will they learn if their feedback is also generated by AI?

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on maintaining the human element in feedback. 

When you are using AI for those lesson planning tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete request and let it handle that independently?

User: I always go back and forth with the AI. Since I teach a specialized and less common language, I have yet to find an AI tool that is always correct. I tend to make a first prompt that is very broad, and once I can see the lesson plan that is initially generated, I can ask about certain elements of the lesson plan, or adjust it to better fit the needs of my classes. I have never just taken a lesson plan generated by AI and used it as-is.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes, definitely. The head of my department is very interested in finding ways to teach students how to use AI responsibly, and to their benefit. There is no requirement that we use AI in our teaching currently, but I have learned a lot from the various lesson planning tools available.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There is an AI program that is currently only being used at a handful of parochial schools. Teachers can upload materials to limit what the AI is able to reference, and a rubric for AI grading and feedback. My school began testing this program last year in relevant classes, but it does not yet work as smoothly as it should. Students are not supposed to be able to paste text into the box, but that feature doesn't always work. The rubrics are extremely time consuming to input. The AI is supposed to offer feedback that doesn't simply correct mistakes, but explain them, however it usually just gives corrections. Since my school is invested in this product, it can be frustrating.

AI: That does sound frustrating when the technology isn't living up to its promise, especially when your school has made an investment in it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No. I cannot imagine a world in which the entire act of teaching is replaced by AI. I think it is important to not ignore it, and to figure out how to leverage AI to help me complete my job duties. I also think that it is important to teach students how to best use AI, rather than having them use it without ever learning the basic skills of research and inquiry.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see myself coming up with a better way to incorporate active AI feedback into advanced student writing. While I think that grammar software in particular can be a quick time-saver for some adults, if students never learn how to write correctly and why editing is important, they will lose out on essential communication skills. I am somewhat resistant to AI in education, but as with all things, I hope to learn how to co-exist and work with it responsibly.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on balancing AI assistance with maintaining essential student learning, especially around the importance of human feedback in writing development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the thoughtful integration of AI in education - especially your approach to using it as a planning tool while preserving the human elements that are crucial for student learning - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
