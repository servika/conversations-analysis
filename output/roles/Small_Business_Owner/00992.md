Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI:

User: I'm ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI models to troubleshoot and learn software tasks in the Adobe suite of products. I also use AI for content writing, SEO optimization, and marketing campaigns for my photography/web design business.

AI: That's a great range of uses across both the technical and creative sides of your business. 

When you're using AI for these different tasks - whether it's troubleshooting Adobe software or working on marketing content - could you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like? Are you more likely to collaborate with the AI throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: I typically collaborate with AI throughout. I might provide a floor plan of a facility and ask it for a flight plan for my FPV drone. 

Another way I use AI models is to provide an outline for an "About Us" page on a new website and ask it to create writing content based on a specific set of keywords, I've already developed and indexed.

I also consult for a new company with a large sports facility in which I will sometimes use AI for business planning and financials forecasts.

AI: It sounds like you're using AI as a real collaborative partner across these different projects. I'm curious about your decision-making process around this.

Are there certain tasks in your photography, web design, or consulting work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are a couple of tasks I prefer to do myself and others that I just want to oversee. For example, color grading my images and footage is a very subjective task that my reputation depends on. I both enjoy and need to remain consistent with the style I provide to my clients. Another example is client communication. I prefer to communicate with my clients in my own words as the psychology of linguistics can make or break a small business owner.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping control over the elements that define your brand and client relationships. The way you describe color grading as both something you enjoy and something your reputation depends on is really insightful.

You mentioned that you "just want to oversee" some tasks. Can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? How do you typically oversee AI's work on those tasks?

User: Financials, spreadsheets, as well as content writing, I am happy to oversee. I think of it as delegating these tasks to another employee and checking their work. Current models have come a long way in regard to their natural and authentic choice of words, but can still sometimes be seen as lifeless or robotic. I prefer to be the final editor, but let the models do the heavy lifting.

AI: That's a really helpful way to think about it - like delegating to an employee and checking their work. It sounds like you've developed a good sense of where AI excels and where it still needs that human touch.

How have your colleagues or clients influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you encountered any particular attitudes or expectations from them about AI use?

User: As I am the final decision maker, most clients are unaware. Most of my LLM use is to save myself time and stay organized. For example, recently I built an entire 19 page business plan with the help of AI just by conversation alone and without the need for excessive lists, word documents, spreadsheets, etc. This saves quite a bit of time, when the finished product can just be an iteration of my own explanations and dictations.

AI: That's fascinating - creating a 19-page business plan through conversation alone sounds incredibly efficient. The fact that most clients are unaware really speaks to how seamlessly you've integrated AI into your workflow.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have significant experience in HR and recruitment and there was a point where I wanted to experiment with a new idea. My academic background is in psychology and I thought if there was a way to build a point system to analyze and rate candidate's word choices, I could build a sort of back-up to reading human intention and susceptibility. I created a massive list of words with the help of a LLM and rated each based on candidate susceptibility and red flags. For example, "everything" was rated more aggressively and tagged as a point leaning towards a frankness red flag.

AI: That sounds like a really innovative application of your psychology background combined with AI capabilities. 

What happened when you implemented this system? Did it work the way you hoped, or did you run into challenges that made you feel frustrated with the process?

User: I was very impressed with how well the model was able to mirror my thought process. The first few were a bit erratic, but as I gave more examples, the model was able to refine its analyses much closer to mine.

Much of my frustration when I've used AI for work has involved up-to-date information such as giving me the wrong steps to complete a task in an outdated software application or lack of contextual memory across conversations. As I sometimes use AI as a soundboard for ideas and future endeavors, I expect an accurate memory of those conversations to be re-visited at a later date.

AI: The memory limitation you're describing sounds like a real workflow disruption, especially when you're using AI as a soundboard for ongoing projects and ideas.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, in fact I have diverted much of my resources away from web design and SEO due to the future capability to translate speech into action for all small business consumers.

AI: That's a significant strategic shift - moving resources away from web design and SEO based on where you see AI heading. It sounds like you're thinking several steps ahead about how the market might change.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What do you think that partnership will look like as the technology continues to develop?

User: I believe in the future, AI will be much more task oriented and I will be there more for oversight. I will need to adapt to a role that will then involve the set-up of tasks less than the completion. For example, a full interior and exterior drone tour or survey may be completely automated, but will need safety oversight as well as metric comprehension. Images and footage may be generated instead of captured, leading to new technologies that don't involve cameras, but scanning technology instead. As for the other two sides of my business (consultation and web design/seo), I believe the web design will be unnecessary and the consultation will remain, but be much more efficient in terms of analytics.

AI: That's a really thoughtful vision of how your role might evolve - shifting from task completion to setup and oversight, and adapting your business model based on technological changes. Your example about drone work moving from capture to scanning technology shows you're thinking deeply about these transitions.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your current AI use and future planning. I particularly appreciated how you described using AI like delegating to an employee and your strategic decision to shift resources based on where you see the technology heading.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from maintaining creative control over color grading to strategically pivoting your business model have been incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you've developed such a collaborative yet strategic approach to working with AI. Take care!
