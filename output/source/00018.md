Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions yet.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work in social media marketing and digital projects.  I typically do posts for Instagram and TikTok and website banners. I also do graphics for TVs.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse mix of visual work across different platforms. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: AI can be useful to come up for ideas for social media content and keep up with trends. I use it to brainstorm ideas occasionally. I also use it to proof read scripts for TikToks.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you both on the ideation side and with refining your content.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I worked on a project recently that was translating library jargon into Gen Z slang. I used it to come up with put library terms into funny Gen Z terms that would be better for students to understand.

AI: That sounds like a really creative and fun project! Tell me more about that process - how did you work with AI to translate those library terms into Gen Z slang?

User: I inputed the jargon I wanted to include into Chat GPT and said translate this into Gen Z terms in a sentence.

AI: When you were working through that translation process with ChatGPT, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what was driving the creative decisions about which terms to use or how funny they should be?

User: I was definitely making the creative decisions. I was choosing the terms I wanted to use and if ChatGPT gave me response that did not make sense or did not fit what I wanted, I had it revise the sentence.

AI: That makes sense - you were staying in the driver's seat creatively. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: AI definitely cuts down on planning and editing time. It helps a lot with coming up with ideas and editing the final product. Usually the bulk of the actual creation of content is done by me.

AI: So it sounds like AI is really streamlining some of those supporting tasks for you. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: In the marketing field, it is a little concerning how many jobs are going to be taken over by AI. I think it is important to learn to work with AI and use it to your advantage. There are still human skills that cannot be replicated by AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - both acknowledging the concern but also seeing the strategic importance of adapting to work alongside it.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it will enhance marketing and social media, cutting down on the amount of time it takes to finish a project.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while using AI as a tool to streamline planning and editing, and how you see the importance of learning to work with AI strategically.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for ideation and editing while maintaining creative control, and your thoughtful approach to adapting alongside these tools, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
