Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's go ahead and start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In general my use of AI falls into 3 main categories: research, debugging/optimization, and prototyping. I've come to rely on using AI to help answer very specific questions that I would have in the past spent minutes to hours googling and then looking through forums like stack exchange or stack overflow or a specific API. I had a problem last week that involved logarithms that I wasn't sure about and just gave the model my problem to solve and help me work out a general solution quickly. In terms of debugging and optimization, I'll often just go ahead and give my command prompt outputs and code directly to models now if the error isn't straightforward or I'm having difficulty tracing the root cause. The same process goes for optimizing a rather cumbersome method or section of my code when my debugger/linter shows an overly complex piece of code and I want to see how a different approach might be taken by the model. In both of these scenarios I'm in a sense using the AI as a co-coder to help me augment my knowledge and speed up general development. The last thing I'll generally do is take a program or function requirement and paste it into the model and use the code that it generates as my boilerplate or starting code. In the past I might spend hours just trying to get a basic prototype for a new project started only to have to tweak and debug it along the way. Letting the model start the process can significantly cut down on development time and allow me to focus on adding the details and specific requirement of that project without having to start from scratch every time.

AI: That's a really detailed picture of how you've integrated AI across different stages of your development work. I'm particularly interested in that shift you mentioned - moving from spending "minutes to hours googling" to getting quick answers from AI.

When you're working through those logarithm problems or debugging sessions with the AI, how do you typically structure that interaction? Are you going back and forth with the model, or do you usually get what you need in one exchange?

User: It's a mix of both and really depends on the complexity. If I just need a one off answer it might be a single prompt and response. For longer more complex tasks I like to go back and forth and iterate through the development alongside the model. That way I'm actually learning at the same time rather than just blindly copying and pasting. Doing so can allow me to fine tune the code that I actually end up putting into production or take an entirely different approach after seeing how the model wants to approach the problem vs how I initially thought I would on my own.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using the back-and-forth to actually learn rather than just getting a quick solution. It sounds like you've found a balance between efficiency and maintaining your own understanding.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If I need to do something novel I'll usually start by getting some examples from an AI model first, just as I'd normally do by walking through a tutorial and after reading an API on my own. I had to do something with a google API a few weeks ago that I was unfamiliar with and the model was helpful in generating novel examples so I could see what I needed to do in a broad sense. Something though I'll still write starting code myself, especially if my current project is similar to an existing one - maybe with a few tweaks. I try to reuse my own code, especially if it's been commented and already optimized, whenever possible. I don't see the need to remake the wheel every time or waste energy and time tweaking code the model generates when I already have a basic framework in my own library of code.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - leveraging your existing code library when you have something that already works well. It sounds like you're making strategic decisions about when to use AI versus when to draw from your own experience.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? You mentioned going back and forth for complex tasks, but I'm curious - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'll usually do both depending on the project. I might start by asking it to come up with code that satisfies the entire method/class/project and then iterate along with the model until  I get the desired program. I'll frequently get something close to what I wanted, copy and tweak it how I actually want it to look, give my modified version back to the model and then move on to the next part of the problem. In that sense I'm making increment changes that have my exact needs and using the model to orchestrate things and see if what I'm writing and what I actually end up using are the most efficient and best code for the problem. It can be extremely useful to have a second set of eyes on your work.

AI: That iterative process you describe - where you're both building together and using the AI as that "second set of eyes" - sounds like a really collaborative workflow. It seems like you've developed quite a rhythm with these tools.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: For the most part it's been well received and has lead to faster development, especially for more Jr developers. It's allowing them to do more work without needing to stop their or the more Sr dev's workflow in order to complete the task at hand. There's still plenty of collaboration and we still hold regular code review meetings and one on one development sessions, but overall I think it's been a positive new tool to use. There is a slight fear that eventually the models might get good enough to replace some of the staff, especially entry level positions, but it's not something we're taking seriously enough to stop using the tech at this time.

AI: It's interesting that you mention how it's particularly helping junior developers become more autonomous while still maintaining those collaborative practices like code reviews. That seems like a significant shift in how teams can operate.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was working on a project for a friend of mine a few months ago. He needed something he could demo to this students to illustrate recursive math functions and specifically fractals. I offered to help him put something together that the could share with his class. I think I was using ChatGPT to do this and it gave me something that looked good and somewhat fuctioned, but it was incomplete in main areas of the requirements. It's like the model just gave up and wanted me to do the rest as homework. Mind you I could have done the work myself, but the fact that I basically put in "to do later" placeholders was really frustrating. it's like the model just got lazy or was refusing to finish the job without further input on my end.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to help out a friend and you get what feels like an incomplete handoff with "homework" left for you to finish. It sounds like the model started strong but then just... stopped putting in the effort.

When something like that happens, how do you typically handle it? Do you push back and ask it to complete the work, or do you just move on and finish it yourself?

User: I had to do both. Some of the work I just had to do myself and code by hand. other times I just started new conversations and asked for specific fuction/methods in order to fill in all of the code that I needed.

AI: That makes sense - sometimes it's faster to just code it yourself rather than trying to coax the model into doing what you originally asked for.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yeah, it's definitely something I consider. It forces me to look at what I write harder to make sure I'm doing it to the best of my ability especially when I have a tool that can do a decent job at checking my work for bugs and that can help me write better code from the start.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - using AI as a way to actually raise your own standards rather than just relying on it. It sounds like having that "decent job at checking" capability pushes you to be more intentional about your own work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it becoming more like my own Jr dev that can do more independently or like a coworker, rather than a replacement. Something I can delegate more mundane tasks to and free myself to actually finding novel solutions to things. I hope that eventually it will also be able to really think and come up with new ideas to problems we haven't even thought of yet, rather than just fancy prediction.

AI: That vision of AI as more of a junior developer or coworker who can handle the mundane work while you focus on novel problem-solving is really compelling. The distinction you made between "fancy prediction" versus actually thinking through new ideas is particularly interesting.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as that "second set of eyes" and how you've developed such an iterative, collaborative workflow with these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not at this time. Thank you for your interview.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative collaboration process, the impact on junior developers, and that vision of AI as a coworker rather than a replacement will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your workflow and share both the satisfying and frustrating moments - that gives us a much more complete picture of what it's actually like to work with these tools day-to-day.

Have a great rest of your day!
