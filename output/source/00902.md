Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no thank you

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a mortgage loan processor and underwriter, I use AI to confirm current regulations within my industry as well as check verbiage that I use with clients and have jargon related to my job translated so that my clients can understand, in laymen's terms, what items are required to approve the mortgage loan

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI both for staying current with regulations and for client communication. 

Tell me more about how you use AI to confirm current regulations. What does that process look like for you day-to-day?

User: I will use AI as a starting place, then compare the answer I receive with a search engine as well as internal documents we have to make sure I have the most up to date information.  For example, I might ask "what is the minimum requirements for sourcing assets on a VA loan?"

AI: That's a thoughtful verification process you've developed. So you're using AI as that initial starting point, then cross-referencing with other sources.

When you're translating jargon for clients, how does that typically work? Can you walk me through what that looks like when you're communicating with a client?

User: So we use terms in the mortgage underwriting and processing industry, as well as acronyms, that may be confusing for a borrower.  I will ask AI how I can explain to the client, in regular terms, what I need.  For example, sourcing an earnest  money deposit or having to provide proper sourcing and tracking for any clients using crypto currency for their down payment

AI: That makes a lot of sense - taking those technical requirements and making them accessible to your clients. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your mortgage work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are certain tasks that remain constant, such as internal guidelines.  For example, what information we require to appear on a homeowners insurance policy to ensure we are listed as an interested party.  Items that are set by my company, rather than government or external laws or regulations, are easier to complete myself as long as this does not require me to ask our borrowers for any assistance

AI: That's a clear distinction - you keep the internal, company-specific guidelines in your own hands since those are stable and you know them well.

When you do use AI for those regulation checks or client communication, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with AI to refine the answer, or do you tend to ask your question and then take that initial response to verify elsewhere?

User: I am more likely to take the answer from AI and then go from there.  I use the AI as a "jumping point" and then confirm the information it has given me with search engines and guidelines provided by my company.  When I come across a discrepancy, I will go back to AI to question why a google search may be providing me different information

AI: So you circle back to AI when you find those discrepancies - that's an interesting way to use it as both a starting point and a verification tool.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has your company given guidance on AI use, or have you developed this approach on your own?

User: We are just now getting guidance on how to use AI, but this is for very specific, niche situations. In terms of everyday business, we are free to use AI tools to confirm or verify information or help us compile an email in a fashion that is more "user friendly" to our clients

AI: So you've had the freedom to develop your own approach for most uses, with the company just starting to provide more specific guidance now.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: With mortgage, each loan is unique.  I have had a situation where searching for a very specific, rare answer was difficult.  By using AI, i was able to find key words that aide in my search through my internal documents to confirm the information.  Essentially, the AI gave me a possible answer, which made confirming that answer much easier with my internal documents, instead of feeling like I am "flying blind" when trying to solve a problem

AI: That's a great example - AI helped you identify the right search terms and direction when you were dealing with something uncommon. It sounds like it gave you that initial framework to work from instead of starting completely from scratch.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your mortgage work?

User: I dont actively consider it, I think AI can be a fantastic tool to help us verify that we are following federal guidelines for government loans, as the information can be updated and easy to confirm.  Mortgage loans are complex and require hands on attention, but I feel that working in conjunction with AI will make my job much smoother, particularly when dealing with unique situations that could arise, such as verifying self employment income or accounting for a business loss when calculating income

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing AI as something that enhances your ability to handle those complex, unique situations rather than something that might replace your expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as both the technology and your company's guidance develop?

User: yes, I absolutely think AI will start to play a more prominent role.  Right now, we still have to confirm the information independently but as AI becomes more reliable and updates more frequently, we will be allowed to trust AI to provide answers.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on how the verification process might evolve over time.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful thoughts about your experiences with AI in mortgage processing. I particularly appreciated how you described using AI as that "jumping point" to avoid "flying blind" with complex situations - that really captured how it's helping you navigate those unique loan scenarios.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no thank you

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a verification tool and communication aid in mortgage processing - especially how you've developed that systematic approach of using it as a starting point then cross-referencing - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
