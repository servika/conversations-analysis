Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

To get us started, could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to help my upload posts to my INstagram that Im trying to grow. For instance, what are the trending hashtags. I use it to help me write product descriptions for things that I am uploading to Redbubble and Etsy. I also use it to help me plan what i need to do in the coming weeks and months. So on a typical day I'll be asking it to write some descriptions, suggest services I could use and to help me plan tasks for the week

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI is supporting several different aspects of your creative business. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I keep track of things myself, like how much money ive made in a day and i check off things on a list on paper, both of these are a mixture of i dont know where the AI would store the information and so its easier to have it on a notepad/paper on my desk for easy reference and habit

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that physical reference right there and knowing exactly where your information is. When you do use AI for those tasks we talked about - like writing product descriptions or planning - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will use it to get started. I am not a great creative writer and I do not know what would be good for SEO, So I will upload a picture of something that I have made and ask for a good SEO description, key words etc. Then I will modify the wording to make it a bit more real, correct any assumptions or incorrect information that may be in the description as well as removing any language thats a bit over the top or cringe

AI: That's a really interesting collaborative approach - using AI as a starting point and then adding your own voice to make it authentic. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned Instagram, Redbubble, and Etsy, I'm wondering if other creators or the online communities you're part of have shaped how you think about using these tools?

User: Not as far as Etsy is concerned as I am just concentrating on getting my own listings set up at the moment, however I have seen some creators on Instagram that have used AI to start their digital art then embellished themselves, so it makes the art look less AI slop like, one of the artists told me it gets rid of the really time consuming stuff, i was always quite against AI art but that made me stop and think. In my previous role in the corporate world, someone there on my team used to use AI for as much as he could and it made me curious too.

AI: That shift in perspective is really interesting - hearing from that artist about how they use AI to handle the time-consuming parts rather than replace their creativity entirely. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: So in my corporate job, I was using an AI to help me extract information from spreadsheets and i got frustrated when it said it would do something and then didn't so it was just lying, which was more frustrating than if it had of said it couldnt do it, as i was wasting my time waiting to do something it couldnt. However i realised i had made the prompts a bit over complicated. When i found it satisfying is in learning how to use photo editing programmes every time in the past to learn a photoediting programme like GIMP was so overwhelming and I didnt know where to start, however I did an edit a week or so ago with the AI telling me what settings to use to get the effects i had asked for and it made learning much easier.

AI: That's a great example of how the interaction style really matters - the difference between AI saying it can do something versus being upfront about limitations, and how breaking down complex learning into manageable steps can be so much more effective. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I used to be really worried about AI 'taking my job' year ago when I handled claims and there was loads of talk about how it would put us out of a job (I was at a conference once when the CEO of one of the worlds biggest insurers told us that we'd all be replaced by AI in three years - that was 8 years ago) As i got higher up the corporate ladder that threat felt less real as the job was about getting people to do things and relationships, not day to day data work. Now as a creative, I create physical things and I dont think AI will be doing what I do any time soon...there is probably not enough money in it

AI: That's such a thoughtful evolution - from that initial fear when you heard the CEO's prediction to recognizing that the human elements of your work, whether relationships in corporate roles or the physical creation in your current work, are what really matter. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: i may buy a paid version of the one that I am currently using to see whether it has better /more up to date information. Right now I am setting up lots of things and so I think ill be able to evaluate how valuable AI was to me in all this in a few months, I will then likely be able to work out where it adds the most value and where it is not being helpful or i could do it better in terms of market research, trends etc. I think it will always help me here but that ill also have a better feel for it myself after AI has helped me get my head around what I should be looking at.

AI: That sounds like a really strategic approach - using this setup phase to figure out where AI adds the most value and where your own judgment works better. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how that artist's approach to AI art changed your thinking, and how you've moved from worrying about replacement to finding collaborative ways to use these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution from fear to collaboration, and how you're strategically evaluating AI's value in your creative business, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with growing your Instagram and getting your Redbubble and Etsy shops set up!
