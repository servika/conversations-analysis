Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use it for obscure terminology research. For example, in a work from the interwar period, I've found it very useful for unpacking terms that have been puzzling me for years.

AI: That's fascinating - terminology research in interwar period works sounds like it would involve some really specific and nuanced language. 

Tell me more about what that research process looks like when you're working with AI on these puzzling terms.

User: Sorry for the delay, I was looking for a good example. Here, the German is "Mir selbst ist es aufgefallen, daß die Wiener in der Elektrischen viel freundlicher und netter waren". I had always thought that "der Elektrischen" had something to do with electric lighting, but in fact it turned out to be the electric trams. That was something I was able to uncover with AI after working on this particular piece for over a decade.

AI: That's a perfect example - and what a satisfying moment that must have been after puzzling over it for a decade! The shift from thinking about electric lighting to realizing it was the electric trams completely changes the meaning of that observation about Viennese friendliness.

When you approach AI with these kinds of historical terminology questions, how do you typically frame your inquiry? Do you provide the full context, or start with just the puzzling term itself?

User: I'll usually start the conversation with something along the lines of "In a novel published in Vienna in 1922, what might [term] mean?". For follow-up terms I don't usually provide additional context unless it adds more context.

AI: That's a smart approach - starting with that historical and geographical context right away. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on this kind of research. Are there aspects of your terminology work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: In general I prefer to handle everything myself unless it seems extremely onerous, and I of course verify anything the AI gives me. It's more like a stepping stone when I've really run out of my own ideas. It's often more useful for finding better or more idiomatic ways to say things in English where I've already sussed the meaning and know there's a more idiomatic way to say something but can't quite put my finger on it.

AI: That's really insightful - using AI as a stepping stone when you've exhausted your own ideas, and especially for that "tip of the tongue" moment when you know there's a better way to express something in English.

When you do turn to AI for help with these challenging terms, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine your understanding, or do you tend to get what you need from that initial query?

User: I'd say about 1/3rd of the time I get what I need from the query, but that's actually not a very high rate. I'll refine it with follow-up questions, although I often find this just gets me thinking better. It's really rigid on specific definitions in some ways and tends to be pretty resistant to outside-the-box interpretations, even when they're clearly what is meant in the context.

AI: That's a really interesting observation about AI being rigid on definitions and resistant to outside-the-box interpretations, especially when you're dealing with historical context where meaning can be so fluid.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing these kinds of research approaches with others in your field?

User: I find my colleagues in general to be extremely anti-AI, so unfortunately these kind of conversations aren't something that is happening in my circles. People feel that it's taking their jobs and don't want to entertain ideas about hybrid forms of work unless they're forced to. Most of the translators I know that are early middle-aged claim they still refuse to use it in any form whatsoever. I don't believe them, but it makes me a bit of a target to be seen arguing in favor of at least knowing what it can do.

AI: That sounds like a challenging position to be in - having found genuine value in AI for your work while feeling like you can't openly discuss it with colleagues who see it as a threat.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, I was extremely frustrated to discover that it seems that Trados has basically no useful AI integration at all. AI-powered QA seems like a complete no-brainer, yet nothing exists in Studio 2025 to take advantage of this natively, and there also don't appear to be any add ons that actually do much of anything with it. The OpenAI machine translation engine is also abysmal, it took more time to fix what it output during my testing than it would have to have simply translated from scratch.

AI: That frustration makes a lot of sense - especially when you can see the clear potential for AI-powered QA in translation work, but the actual implementation falls so short of what would actually be useful.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not too worried about it other than keeping an eye on what AI can do in those areas. I've always said that I'm not paid for words, I'm paid to think. A lot of translators don't seem to understand this and literally believe they're just selling words. If all you output is words, then yeah, you're not going to be in the business very long.

AI: That's a really compelling perspective - "I'm paid to think, not for words." It sounds like you see the analytical and interpretive work you do as the core value you bring.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think it will play a bigger role in your research and translation work over time?

User: I think it's fairly inevitable that it's going to play a bigger role in everyone's work over time, and as long as that reduces the workload for "busywork", that's fine. I think the issue is if it starts causing people in general to lose creativity and lower the bar for everyone.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being paid to think rather than just produce words, and how you use AI as a stepping stone when you've exhausted your own ideas - especially for those decade-long terminology puzzles.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing comes to mind at the moment.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for historical terminology research, navigating the challenging workplace dynamics around AI adoption, and maintaining focus on the analytical thinking that defines your professional value will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candor about both the practical benefits you've found and the limitations you've encountered. Take care!
