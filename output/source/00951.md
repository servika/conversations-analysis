Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good. I do not have any questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an outdoor educator on Catalina Island in California. I often am asking questions about the specific region. This includes describing animals or posting photos of animals in hopes of a correct identification. I also ask more broad questions about the environment or the ocean. For example, I will ask AI to describe the use of DDT, the environmental consequences, and the legal status. I will also ask questions about how that might have affected the specific location of Catalina Island. Sometimes I will ask for information regarding the anatomy and functions of certain animals to then incorporate this information into my lesson plans.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work! I can see how AI would be really valuable for an outdoor educator, especially in such a unique location.

When you're using AI for these different purposes - whether it's animal identification, researching environmental topics like DDT, or gathering information for lesson plans - how do you typically interact with it? Do you tend to have back-and-forth conversations where you're building on the information together, or do you more often ask for complete information that you can then take and use directly?

User: Usually I am asking for very direct answers that have easy-to-spot factual information. Occasionally, I will ask follow up or clarifying questions in a more conversational manner.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you're often looking for specific, reliable information you can use with confidence in your educational work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Tasks like the organization of my classes I usually leave to myself. AI could put together good lesson plans with very specific timing and details. The reason I do not use it for this reason is because I think it would take a long time to get the AI to give a lesson plan that actually works for my purposes. Because the AI does not know which topics I am supposed to cover or the layout of my facility, it wouldn't be very effective. For example, if I asked the AI "give me a 45 minute lesson plan about sharks", it would not yield the information I really wanted it to. It does not know the curriculum that I am required to teach and it would take too long to put in all of that info. It would just be faster and probably yield me better results to just write it myself.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like the more context-dependent and specific to your unique situation a task is, the less efficient AI becomes for you. The AI would need so much background information about your curriculum, facility layout, and specific requirements that it's actually faster to do it yourself.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes using AI allows me a different perspective on how to explain a topic to students. For example, we cover things like shark's Ampullae of Lorenzini, which can be a complicated topic to relay to young students. I used AI and gave it the specific prompt of "please explain the ampullae of lorenzini as if you were a fourth grade science teacher". This yielded me results that I was extremely satisfied with. The most frustrating part of AI is usually asking for identification. With more well-known animals, it generally does well. Once you get into more niche animals, it might not even be able to properly identify the phylum. In these cases, AI become entirely useless.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can help you adapt complex scientific concepts for your audience - getting it to essentially role-play as a fourth grade teacher sounds like it worked perfectly for breaking down that complicated topic.

And I can definitely see how the identification limitations would be frustrating, especially when you're working with the unique marine life around Catalina Island that might not be as well-represented in AI training data.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: At my workplace we spend parts of the year collecting animals for our aquarium. I have seen AI used to get an idea of where to find certain animals or convenient ways to catch these animals. For example, I have used chatGPT to help me catch a specific fish in a specific location. This is something I would have not thought of myself, but a colleague showed me.

AI: That's interesting - so you learned about using AI for collection strategies from a colleague. It sounds like there's some knowledge sharing happening at your workplace about different ways to use these tools.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Though AI might be able to tell me when and where to catch a fish, it will never be able to actually catch it in lieu of me. I do get worried in the sense of AI taking over a lot of education. It can collect and relay information so effectively that it could be an issue in the future. However, I think the physical interaction between students and teachers is important and will never fully be replaced.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you're seeing a clear distinction between AI's ability to provide information versus the irreplaceable value of hands-on, physical interaction in education.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see AI being really useful in deepening and refining my curriculum for students. It will also help me recycle information so that I do not myself get bored with teaching the same thing over and over again.

AI: That's a great way to think about it - using AI to help keep your teaching fresh and engaging for both you and your students.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI works well for getting different explanations of complex topics but struggles with specialized identification tasks in your unique environment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into outdoor education - from helping explain complex concepts like ampullae of lorenzini to students, to its limitations with specialized species identification - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've found that sweet spot of using AI for information gathering and perspective-taking while maintaining the irreplaceable human elements of your work. Thanks again!
