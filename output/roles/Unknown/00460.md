Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI maybe two or three times a week. Usually synthesising work I have already started, turning notes into comprehensive board papers or formatting

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like AI comes in more at the refinement stage of your work rather than the initial creation. 

When you say "synthesising work I have already started," can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I might throw a load of notes, calendars or emails at it and ask it to identify a suitable meeting time, or ask if there are any pieces of information I'm missing, or just break the information down into a digestible few bullet points

AI: That gives me a really clear picture of how you're using it as a processing tool. It sounds like you're feeding it raw information and having it organize or analyze it for you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to write my own emails. I have a personal style of writing and different relationships with my colleagues, including use of emojis or slang, that I may use with some and not others. I feel better making those choice personally than asking AI to do it for me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like there's something important about maintaining that personal touch and judgment in your communications.

When you do use AI for those tasks we talked about earlier - like synthesizing notes or formatting board papers - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and let it handle the task independently?

User: Through trial and error I have found I prefer the outcome when I provide quite a lot of detail upfront and present tasks when they are around 40-50% complete. I feel this gives the AI model more of a sense of what I'm looking for, perhaps when I can't fully articulate it myself in my request.

AI: That's a really insightful approach - essentially using your partially completed work as context to help the AI understand your intent even when you can't fully express it in words.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We have an approved provider for AI tasks. I work for the government and some papers need to stay internal. I would say this discourages me from using it as much as I would as the tool is not the best.

AI: That's really valuable context - so the security requirements create a trade-off where you have access but it's through a less capable tool, which affects how much you actually use it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: An AI tool produced a really well thought-out Visioning document for a major project I was working on. I had only fed in notes and felt my ideas were not well fleshed out at all. I provided some similar examples of projects I liked and asked the AI to identify where they could inspire my work. I was really happy with the resulting document as I felt like my ideas were represented to their fullest effect, and all elements I wanted to incorporate were there.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience - it seems like the AI helped you take those underdeveloped ideas and give them the structure and depth you were looking for. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My job as a [REDACTED] is largely physical, so I'm not worried about losing the major part of my job to AI. Where I can work with AI I'm keen to do so, as it frees up my time to do important conservation repairs etc. which I really enjoy

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - it sounds like AI actually enhances your ability to focus on the parts of your job you find most meaningful and important.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm hoping the models will develop further and enhance my efficiency.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how providing partially completed work helps the AI better understand your intent, and how AI can free you up to focus on the conservation work you really enjoy.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of - but this was a really thought-provoking conversation for me!

AI: I'm so glad you found it thought-provoking! It's been really insightful hearing about your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into your work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working within government constraints, using AI to enhance rather than replace meaningful work, and that clever strategy of providing 40-50% complete tasks will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
