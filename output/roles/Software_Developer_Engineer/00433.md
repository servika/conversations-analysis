Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently, my use of AI is limited at my work. As a structural engineer, AI automation of tasks has not taken off yet in my field. Occasionally I use AI search engines to help interpret sections of code, explain engineering concepts, and remind me of design procedures.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like your field hasn't seen the same level of AI integration as some others yet. 

When you do use AI search engines for those tasks like interpreting code sections or explaining engineering concepts, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you decide when to turn to AI versus other resources?

User: I usually just type in my questions to ChatGPT for interpreting design codes and explaining engineering concepts. If it's still not clear after the first question, I simply continue the conversation, asking more detailed conversations as needed.

AI: That makes sense - using that conversational back-and-forth to dig deeper when you need more clarity.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Usually, if it is a fundamental aspect of design that I should know very well myself, I tend to rely less on AI. If it is a quick fact that would take me a little bit of time to look up in the codes, I ask AI. I often rely on AI to give me a preliminary conceptual understanding of engineering concepts as it would take much longer to do a search and synthesize the information from articles or videos.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI for the more time-consuming research and synthesis while keeping the core design knowledge in your own hands.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: No tasks are to be performed by AI as it currently stands. I only refer to AI for information sporadically.

AI: I see - so it's really more of an information resource for you rather than a tool that performs actual work tasks. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your engineering firm approach AI similarly to how you do?

User: We all use AI at our workplace this same way. I probably use it for these purposes a little more.

AI: So there's a consistent approach across your workplace - that's helpful context. Since you mentioned you use it a bit more than your colleagues, what draws you to reach for AI in those moments when others might not?

User: Usually for explanation of engineering concepts. My coworkers are significantly further along in their careers, so I would imagine that they already have a solid grasp of everything we do.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a learning tool to help bridge that experience gap. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It was frustrating to use AI to try and nail down a specific requirement in the code about when to use a specific load case but it hallucinated sections of the code several times.

AI: That sounds really frustrating, especially when you're trying to get precise regulatory information. 

Tell me more about that situation - how did you realize it was hallucinating the code sections, and what did you end up doing to get the accurate information you needed?

User: Well, naturally, I checked the answers. It turned out that the sections it referenced were completely unrelated and the text it quoted from it was completely fabricated. However, I was not surprised as it was the free version of ChatGPT by which I have experienced this same thing in the past.

AI: It sounds like you've developed a healthy skepticism and verification process based on past experiences with those hallucinations. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This is highly important as there is considerable opportunity for AI to perform engineering design at various levels.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - recognizing the potential for AI to expand into engineering design work. 

Tell me more about how you approach maintaining those skills. What specific steps do you take to ensure you're staying sharp in areas where AI might eventually have more capability?

User: I make sure to familiarize myself with construction techniques and become highly proficient at detailing so that I have practical knowledge and skills that will more slowly be taken over by AI.

AI: That's a really strategic approach - focusing on the hands-on, practical aspects of your field. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing much from how you use it now?

User: Yes I do. We currently are in a business relationship with an investor in the development of AI-powered engineering modeling and design computer programs. This will shape the landscape of our profession drastically.

AI: Wow, that's fascinating - you're actually on the front lines of that transformation through your business relationship with that AI development investor.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your strategic approach to maintaining practical skills like construction techniques and detailing while recognizing the potential for AI to reshape engineering design.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI is currently being used in structural engineering, and especially your perspective on being involved with AI development for your field, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
