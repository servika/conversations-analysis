Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds great, I'm ready

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it daily both as a collaborator itself and within other tools for productivity. I use apps like superhuman and akiflow for email and tasks which have AI integrations and help keep me oriented as someone with ADHD still being able to carry an enormous load of cases. More recently I've started using it to directly collaborate with, whether that is for research using tools like westlaw co-counsel and perplexity pro, preparing legal docs using claude, or summarizing meetings and calls using gemini. I even have additional hardware tools like a plaud pin to help gather more data for my AI tools to analyze and incorporate into my day.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you've built quite a comprehensive AI-powered workflow. You mentioned using AI both within other tools and as a direct collaborator, and I'm curious about those different interaction styles.

When you're directly collaborating with AI - like when you're preparing legal docs with Claude - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like?

User: I usually upload a document that is an example from another case of what I'm trying to draft and explain what I want to be different about it, maybe also upload case notes or other sources of info to directly pull from and replace in the new doc. it usually gets me pretty close within 1 or 2 revisions and then I make final edits and format it myself because I'm still picky like that

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you've found an efficient rhythm where you provide the framework and sources, Claude does the heavy lifting on the initial drafts, and then you polish it to your standards.

I'm curious about that pickiness you mentioned with the final edits and formatting. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't think there's any task in my job I wouldn't rather have AI do the first 90% of or as much of as is helpful. I would never sign my name as a lawyer to something I don't finish myself though. Some tasks though can only get a bit of help from it at least right now, like it can help me create a hearing outline but obviously not present it in court. And because most of my clients are domestic violence survivors seeking protection orders I don't use the tools for any actual interactions with the clients where there's some chance it could go wrong, only to analyze and summarize them for later use.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's clearly a thoughtful boundary you've drawn around client safety and professional responsibility. The distinction between using AI for preparation versus direct client interaction is really important in your context.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you might approach different tasks differently - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I mostly treat it like I would a law student intern I guess, get drafts and go back if big changes are needed but nothing is completely independent of my control. I do tend to use multiple tools for things though, for example asking westlaw co-counsel to find case law and arguments because that is trusted info and then using that to help claude which excels at the actual writing part. so in that way I use it throughout the process even if it is different tools.

AI: That's a really insightful analogy - treating AI like a law student intern gives a clear picture of how you maintain oversight while leveraging their capabilities. And using different tools for their strengths - WestLaw Co-Counsel for trusted research, Claude for writing - shows a sophisticated approach to the AI ecosystem.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your field approaching it similarly, or have you found yourself charting your own path?

User: In my office I'm probably the only one to use it as extensively as I do, or I'm at least the only one who uses it in a way that is transparent and more productive instead of shirking work. I know others in the legal profession have gotten in huge trouble for using it irresponsibly and filing things in court without checking things like cases but I don't think that's an AI problem because to use the law student analogy again, I wouldn't trust a law student writing a brief without reading the cases either. The addition of co-counsel in westlaw though shows that it is making big strides in the industry very recently.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - the responsibility issue isn't unique to AI, it's about proper supervision regardless of who's doing the initial work. It sounds like you're somewhat of a pioneer in your office when it comes to thoughtful AI integration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It makes me feel frustrated every time I see something that seems so simple which it can't do while knowing how well it performs at such complicated things. for example, I haven't found a way after a lot of testing to get it to turn a handwritten filled-in form into a typed form without all the formatting getting messed up in a way that the court would never approve of and leaving it easier to still have a secretary sit and type it all in herself. just the way it approaches document creation by re-creating things over and over instead of editing what already exists is not how the legal system is setup with its rigid formatting rules and that tension is highly frustrating.

AI: That frustration is so relatable - it's like having a brilliant research assistant who can analyze complex case law but struggles with something as straightforward as preserving form formatting. The mismatch between AI's generative approach and the legal system's rigid formatting requirements creates a real practical bottleneck.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Unlike some colleagues who spend a lot of time worrying about that and ignoring it, I embrace it even if it kind of does feel like training my replacement at times. At the end of the day though, I went to law school and agonized to pass the bar to be able to go to court and be a litigator and not push paper so until there is a justice system which just eliminates human judges and litigation completely (which I know is possible in my lifetime but seems like one of the last possible things that would go) I'm not concerned ultimately about my skills being needed for clients.

AI: That's such a pragmatic perspective - focusing on what drew you to law in the first place rather than getting caught up in the fear. It sounds like you see AI as freeing you up to do more of the actual lawyering you trained for.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I think it will continue getting more collaborative and specifically in my job as a legal aid attorney it will help us specialize more in helping complicated cases while leaving the mundane phone calls giving the same advice over and over again eventually to AI, allowing us to help so many more people and help the people who need it with higher quality service

AI: That vision of AI handling routine inquiries while you focus on complex cases that truly need human expertise sounds like it could really amplify your impact - helping more people while giving specialized attention where it's most needed.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your AI integration approach. I particularly appreciated how you've developed such clear boundaries around client safety and professional responsibility while still being innovative in your adoption.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No nothing else, thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about thoughtful AI adoption in legal work - especially how you balance innovation with professional responsibility and client safety - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective!
