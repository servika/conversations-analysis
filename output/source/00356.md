Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI to research and find information specific to the topic I need. For example, in education using AI to help find key information about topics and using that information to form lesson plans and create questions for students to answer

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you with both the research phase and the content creation aspects of lesson planning.

When you say you use AI to find key information about topics, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you go from having a topic in mind to getting the specific information you need?

User: Lets say I want to do a lesson about the Romans and their influence in the UK and the lasting presence they had. First I would ask AI to gather key information about the Romans and the roman empire. Making note of the response I will ask the AI model to gather information about the Romans (empire) presence in the UK. What did they do, how did they come here, what was their lasting influence. Based on the information, I may use AI to help create age appropriate questions to give to my students or talking points.

AI: That's a really clear process - it sounds like you're building up your understanding layer by layer, from the broad empire context to the specific UK influence, and then translating that into classroom materials.

Tell me more about that final step where you create the age-appropriate questions and talking points. How do you work with AI on that part - do you give it specific guidance about your students, or does it naturally adjust to what you need?

User: I make sure to include the ages of my students to make the questions are appropriate for their age and learning. I like to ask for talking points that I can use to get the conversation about the topic going, if my students do not know much about the topic I'm teaching.

AI: That makes a lot sense - getting those conversation starters when students might be encountering a topic for the first time.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I do like to create my lessons plans on my own and create worksheets using the information I found using the AI. I like to be creative so I focus in that area while using AI to do the research aspect for me.

AI: That's a really clear division - using AI for the research legwork while keeping the creative lesson planning and worksheet design for yourself.

When you are working with AI on the research side, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it throughout your research process, or do you tend to ask it to handle specific research tasks independently and then move on?

User: I tend to have a set idea of questions that I want an answer to and then ask AI. Depending on the type of lesson and topic I may use it continuously to research.

AI: So it sounds like your approach varies depending on what you're working on - sometimes it's more of a one-and-done interaction, other times it becomes more of an ongoing research conversation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that played a role in how you've developed your approach?

User: My workplace and colleagues haven't influenced my approach to AI. I was one of the first in my workplace to use it to help with my lesson planning/

AI: Interesting - so you were really pioneering this approach at your workplace. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There is a set curriculum and trying to remember all the information across the various topics and age groups can be challenging. Using AI to help refresh my knowledge so I feel confident in teaching the information made me feel satisfied.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can support your confidence as an educator - having that knowledge refresher readily available when you need it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: When it comes to teaching young people, childhood studies has shown the importance of teaching face to face, so I am not too concerned about AI in that regard.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing the irreplaceable value of that human connection in teaching young people.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: I could see AI taking more of a role in my work. With the changing curriculum and updates to teaching strategies, I can see myself using AI in more ways especially as classrooms become more crowded leaving less time to research and create lessons plans. It would be nice to use AI to help mark homework for example.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you feel more confident by refreshing your knowledge across different topics and age groups - that's such a practical benefit.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No we have covered it all

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research partner while maintaining the creative and interpersonal aspects of teaching yourself will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've carved out this balanced approach - leveraging AI's strengths in information gathering while keeping the human elements that are so crucial in education. Thank you for participating in this interview!
