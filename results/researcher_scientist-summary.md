## Representative Insights

### How Researchers & Scientists Use AI

1. "I thought AI would be a good fit because it's able to sort through information a lot faster than me. I was able to use it instead of having to go through every material data sheet individually. I find AI is also good at presenting information it finds in clear formats."
   *— From conversation 00029.md*

2. "As far as printing and physical testing, AI is still unable to do either one of these things. For analyzing test results, I thought that the results were to important, and that I should do it myself, because AI tools can occasionally hallucinate analysis to give the user what the model thinks it wants."
   *— From conversation 00029.md*

3. "AI was mostly used to debug code and might have been used by some members to help them create code or have a starting point to writing their parts of the code. That's about it though.
AI was definitely brought up and considered in our project, but since it is more of a proof of concept/experimental project, we didn't want to commit too many resources to learning how to effectively set up and use AI this time around. Maybe in the future though."
   *— From conversation 00030.md*

4. "It pretty much boiled down to a resource problem. We didn't want to invest much money or time for people to learn how to use it for this specific scenario and to keep the model operational. Once again this was kind of a dipping our toes in project, before we decide whether or not to more fully commit to this type of work or not."
   *— From conversation 00030.md*

5. "Being able to correctly tell me about any concept in my field when I ask it to. It would be very helpful to have an accurate repository of information for any simple definitions/concepts that I can query with an AI. This would save so much time so that I don't have to browse the web or research papers to remind myself (if I already know it) or learn about (if I don't)."
   *— From conversation 00030.md*

6. "We inputted a lot of raw statistics for each player into the model and asked it to combine certain stats to output another statistic criteria we wanted to use. We also used it to remove players that didn't fit the criteria we were looking for, i.e. players who were rookies or over a certain age."
   *— From conversation 00034.md*

7. "We used AI because we believed it to be a great starting point for code we were writing. It allows you to see an overview of all potentially required sections quicker, thus allowing you to see what is missing or needs improvement. Traditional approaches also work but would have been longer to iterate through many ideas."
   *— From conversation 00034.md*

8. "We found that AI was not able to draw the same in depth conclusions about the picture the statistics painted. It needed to be used in conjunction with a researcher."
   *— From conversation 00034.md*

9. "We would spot check the cleaned data to ensure it was not jargon. For the skeleton we used it as baseline, it needed adjustments to tailor it to what we needed."
   *— From conversation 00034.md*

10. "Beyond the conceptualization of the research topic, I've experimented with AI tools throughout the different steps. Primarily, I have utilized AI to help me process data and identify other pieces of pertinent literature."
   *— From conversation 00035.md*

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "Personally I don't love using it that much since I worry about it's accuracy in my work. You can't really see its reasoning process or thoughts about some aspects and so if I use it to make decisions on subjects I know a lot about, I think it can only do worse than me if I take my time and think it through.
Or for pattern recognition for example I'm sure it can do way better than me, but who's to say the patterns it recognizes are relevant ones or not. 
Overall my main concern is correctness and quality of work."
   *— From conversation 00030.md*

2. "Mostly by testing it. We try to always write modular style code, so we can test small parts together pretty easily. So we just give it a few examples trying to come up with all the edge cases we can think of and see if the code correctly handles that or not. If it does and we review it and can't find any logic errors or have any other concerns with it we will generally slightly modify it for efficiency and use it.
Other times when we see the approach it took, it inspires us and we think of a new and better way to do it. So it is sometimes used almost as a brainstorming tool for inspiration."
   *— From conversation 00030.md*

3. "That sounds good. I will let you know if any questions or concerns come up as we talk"
   *— From conversation 00045.md*

4. "I wonder about ownership. I am concerned about the following: if let's say claude becomes able to do independent research, who gets the credit, would one need to credit it with discoveries, if so I don't know if there is too much of an incentive to include it in research"
   *— From conversation 00045.md*

5. "Mostly feeling nervous about it getting information incorrect. Especially in areas where I'm not very confident and don't have a lot of knowledge, I'd worry that I wouldn't know enough to identify if or when AI explained something incorrectly."
   *— From conversation 00051.md*

6. "It would be very helpful if AI could be used to assess the reliability/quality of research papers by looking at whether the authors used any shortcuts, conducted robust experiments with strong statistical reliability, and whether there are any concerns with the animal models they used (not replicable results, variability in function etc). Some of these things may not be well known or published information so when people from outside the field read these papers, it may be difficult for them to assess whether the findings are reliable."
   *— From conversation 00055.md*

7. "I wish that it wouldn't decide to be completely dismissive of early-stage ideas, or express as much criticism about novel idea's even if I later decide they are unrealistic. I will sometimes need to modify prompts to tell the model to treat my questions as theoretical because it will often cite psychology studies or ethical concerns, when the questions being asked in my research are harmless and more speculative than factual."
   *— From conversation 00070.md*

8. "It put me off using AI in general for a bit and then I crept back to using it through exploring different ways where I didn't;t have to be so concerned about factual accuracy"
   *— From conversation 00579.md*

## Future Perspectives

1. "AI was mostly used to debug code and might have been used by some members to help them create code or have a starting point to writing their parts of the code. That's about it though.
AI was definitely brought up and considered in our project, but since it is more of a proof of concept/experimental project, we didn't want to commit too many resources to learning how to effectively set up and use AI this time around. Maybe in the future though."
   *— From conversation 00030.md*

2. "I recently conducted a study predicting future direct operating costs for an all electric aircraft in commercial aviation. Since this was a purely conceptual research project, no experiments could be conducted, and extensive research was necessary. I created a cost model on Excel, using a number of assumptions and assessed the impact of varying these assumptions. Concluding my research by writing a complete paper about my findings."
   *— From conversation 00036.md*

3. "It was the fastest and easiest solution I could find. I was working by myself late at night figured  I could give AI a shot for trouble shooting. I find that searching through forums and documentation can take lots of precious time and its not guaranteed you are going to find what you are looking for."
   *— From conversation 00057.md*

4. "I think we definitely might use AI in the future perhaps to propose an outline, but I think that at this point, it's just not that difficult to format a paper to a journal's specifications, and creating figures is something that is very specific and collaborative, so I just don't know how helpful AI could be for that. Overall, I just don't think it has been extremely difficult to do those things, so we have not use AI for them."
   *— From conversation 00066.md*

5. "I have not used LLMs to design my quizzes, but I have occasionally used them to brainstorm because the questions I ask are short and direct, and I find that LLMs quickly become wordy or fail to distill complex ideas into short questions. The writing quality is not good enough, but sI could see how it can get better. I am not sure how to implement AI into asking the participants about their cognitive load, but I just now imagined creating an LLM-inspired questionnaire that is more interactive than my pre-written questions being useful in the future."
   *— From conversation 00070.md*

6. "Honestly, my traditional approach worked perfectly fine, it just took time to tweak to the point where I thought it was acceptable to submit. Using AI speeds this up, as I can  just tell it my ideas, and how I want a sentence to come across, and it fires back some ideas, and I can go back forth to dial it just how I want it. The presentation part is more of me overthinking it; I just need someone who I know is not going to plagiarise my work, to give me advice on what would look more professional/scientific."
   *— From conversation 00072.md*

7. "I think that AI will be more common place. I think that it will allow me to handle a larger amount of data or projects with greater ease."
   *— From conversation 00310.md*

8. "That's a great question! At least in the short-term, I see my relationship with AI being about the same, where I use AI to supplement my work and provide a new perspective when needed. I cannot realistically see myself using AI to replace work that I personally do, and will continue to use AI as a supplement. At work, I still expect to use AI exactly how I've been using it!

In the long term? Well, that will entirely depend on AI's advancements and new capabilities!"
   *— From conversation 00701.md*
