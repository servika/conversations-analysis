Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, go ahead.

AI: Great! Let's start with the basics. Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write a lot in my own time and have finished a few (unpublished) books. I write mainly fantasy, but with a heavy focus on plot and character (often politics and intrigue), little to no magic and a preference for keeping things physically and logically plausible despite the plot occurring in a fictional world. This results in having to keep track of lots of practical details like the amount of time it takes to travel between places, probable weather conditions, the progression of moon phases, etc., as well as having to research topics I'm not familiar with to make sure I'm representing them with sufficient accuracy. I also run a Dungeons & Dragons homebrew campaign every couple of weeks, which involves a lot of worldbuilding and keeping track of characters and plot events my party has encountered.

AI: That sounds like incredibly detailed work - I can imagine managing all those moving pieces requires a lot of organization and research. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Generally for research purposes. Since I started using AI tools several months ago, I mainly use them for exploring topics I'm not familiar with. Often, an internet search for the kind of obscure questions I come up with requires multiple tweaks to get the search engine to understand what I'm going for and provide relevant links, then browsing multiple pages to get the answer I'm looking for.

AI: Tell me more about those obscure questions you come up with. What kinds of things are you typically trying to research?

User: In the past few months, a few of the things I've used AI tools to research are the Coriolis effect (working out the likely movement of storm systems off a particular coast), binary star systems (assessing the possibility and possible configurations of livable planets orbiting a star in such a system) and properties of iron vs. steel and the history of creating steel (determining whether a weapon bind in a fight could create sparks).

AI: Those are fascinating research challenges! Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI for research like this? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as a writer?

User: The most recent was the sparking-weapons one. I asked generally about what kinds of metal create sparks when struck, then gave details about the specific weapon bind (a character crossing two shorter weapons, one made of silver, to block a downward swing from a big sword) and asked whether that kind of contact could create sparks if the two unspecified weapons were made of the right material. Then I asked for more information about the history of steelmaking to gauge whether the kind of high-carbon steel necessary to create sparks would be likely to exist commonly in that world, given where it is technologically (though I didn't provide any details about that). Finally I briefly asked whether the description I had written of the effect ("burst of sparks") realistically captured the amount of sparks that might be created.

AI: How did that interaction feel for you as you were working through those questions? When you got those answers about the sparks and steel, how did that influence what you wrote?

User: It didn't really influence what I wrote. If I had learned that it was unlikely sparks could be created by the weapons involved in the fight, I would have edited out the reference to sparks, but I essentially learned that I didn't need to change everything. At the end, I felt satisfied that what I had written was realistic.

AI: When you're working with AI for this kind of research, how would you describe that interaction? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in your writing?

User: The way I use it, I would generally describe it as like interacting with an intelligent, much more effective search engine. I use it to save time when finding information I need for realism, not to help with purely creative decisions.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - using it more as a research tool rather than for the creative aspects themselves. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Certain aspects (like I said, generally research-focused) have become more streamlined and efficient. I spend less time searching on the internet, which leaves me more time to focus on writing and causes less of a disruption when I need to look things up.

AI: What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of writing?

User: I'm not against the possibility of people who aren't writers, artists, etc. using AI tools to create art they wouldn't be able to otherwise. My only concern is the risk of blurring the line between purely human-created content and content that's been heavily influenced, edited, refined or even largely created by AI.

AI: Tell me more about that concern with blurring the line. What would that look like in practice, and why does that worry you?

User: Compare it to a hand-carved, hand-painted sculpture versus a premade, hand-painted sculpture versus a 3D-printed, full-colour sculpture from a pattern. The third might look just as good, but it doesn't require any skill,  just picking a pattern and hitting a button. The second is more impressive and requires time, effort and skill, and the first exhibits the most skill and effort and is the most impressive. But that's fine, because you can easily tell the difference between the three. It can be a lot harder to tell with text or even image-based art, and it'll become harder and harder to tell as AI becomes more advanced.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate continuing with this research-focused approach, or might that change?

User: If AI becomes more advanced and more seamlessly integrated in certain fields, I could see myself using it for administrative tasks and information tracking, like the aforementioned moon phases and estimating travel times, or things like creating timelines to help maintain continuity.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as an intelligent search engine for research while maintaining clear creative control, and your analogy about the different levels of craftsmanship in sculptures - that really captured the nuance of your concerns about distinguishing between human and AI-created content.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I found it really valuable to hear how you've carved out such a specific and intentional role for AI in your work - using it to enhance the research foundation that supports your creativity rather than replacing the creative process itself. Have a great day!
