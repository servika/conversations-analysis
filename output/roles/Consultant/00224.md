Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't have set activities that I always delegate to AI, but I typically use AI to double check some of my more extensive spreadsheets, summarise longer pitch-decks and briefing notes for presentation, and generate simple numerical analyses. I work as a business strategy consultant for the most part so I tend to do the more complicated and crucial tasks myself.

AI: That's interesting that you keep the more complicated and crucial tasks for yourself. Can you tell me more about what makes those tasks different from the ones you do delegate to AI?

User: I often find that AI, across the board, tends to hallucinate or slightly misinterpret instructions especially when generating longer form content. The time I spend going through a response to check for inaccuracies, (which, given that my work is often for a client rather than for myself, is absolutely necessary) can sometimes be similar to generating the content myself. It's about peace of mind, if I write things myself, I know I haven't missed any errors.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the peace of mind factor seems really important when client work is on the line. 

When you do use AI for those tasks like checking spreadsheets or summarizing documents, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: I almost always collaborate with the model, sometimes going through multiple iterations of the same prompt when my wording is unclear or I'm not happy with the final result. Take summarizations for example, most of the time I'm aware of the content as I've produced it myself, but I use the AI to do the extraction and writing for me. In this case I know what should be included, so there might be multiple iterations of a prompt before the final response includes everything I'd like it to. With regard to checking spreadsheets, I use AI frequently, mostly to double check figures across documents, cross referencing etc; I always make sure to give exact cell, line or column numbers so no mistakes are made.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like you've developed some specific techniques to get better results. You mentioned being very precise with cell and column numbers for spreadsheet work - that's a smart way to minimize errors.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they have similar approaches, or have you noticed different patterns?

User: So I work for myself, but I frequently collaborate with other professionals in the same space when working on more complex projects. Many of my colleagues rely more heavily on AI, for example, a lot of them write their emails almost exclusively with AI, and some have automated aspects of their work with the newer assistants like Copilot and ChatGPT Business. I think I'm slowly coming round to the idea of semi-automated communications, but I always feel I can tell when someone is using a model to generate their comms, and I feel a personal approach is still better. This said, as a sole-trader it would be incredibly advantageous for me time-wise to give more of my work to AI.

AI: That tension between wanting to maintain that personal touch and the time advantages is really compelling. You mentioned you can usually tell when someone is using AI for communications - what gives it away?

And since you're recognizing those time advantages as a sole-trader, what holds you back from delegating more work to AI right now?

User: I think because I've been working with certain people for a few years, you can tell based on the way they used to communicate and the way they communicate now; its typically colder and more impersonal even though there may be a longstanding relationship there. I also notice overuse of classic marker works like honed or robust, which are not typical of the lexicon of most people I work with. For me I feel like most models aren't quite there yet, I'd love it if there was an option for the model to review my own work and then be able to speak more convincingly in my written voice, or be more naturally integrated across all my projects. I feel like the input I have to consistently use to get the response I'm looking for is work enough that I may as well do it myself, especially with regard to the more complex queries I may pose.

AI: That's a fascinating observation about the shift to more impersonal communication - those marker words really seem to be telltale signs. The idea of a model that could learn your voice and be more naturally integrated across projects sounds like it would address some of your main concerns.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have used AI multiple times to sharpen up my CV, which most clients of mine want to see or have access to especially during the consultation phase. I have been particularly frustrated with some of my most recent updates by the tendency of most models to embellish what is already on the CV or embellish the update instructions I have given it. I always try to represent myself honestly, because I need to be capable of producing the work I say I can; I almost always have to go back in to make edits because it would take too much time to write a specific enough prompt that the tone is maintained in the CV or proposal I am writing.

AI: That embellishment issue sounds particularly problematic when accuracy and authenticity are so critical for your professional reputation. It sounds like you're caught between wanting the efficiency but needing to maintain that honest representation of your capabilities.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Absolutely, this is not only relevant to my current skills but skills I'm looking to pick up. At the moment I'm pretty up to date on excel and the like, as well as various graphics software (adobe suite etc), a couple of financial tools and various communications systems. It seems to me like these may all become obsolete relatively soon, if not for the need of checking the work done by the AI. I find it slightly frustrating that it took me quite a while to get the hang of these and I may have no need of these skills going forward; I won't maintain a skill I don't practice, and I wont practice a skill if I have no need of it, time is precious. The main issue is skills that I'm looking to pick up, particularly Python and the C languages, which may take a serious amount of time to learn and be wholly unnecessary by the time I finish learning them. It leaves me at a bit of a stalemate for the time being.

AI: That stalemate feeling is really striking - the uncertainty about which skills to invest time in learning when the landscape is changing so rapidly. It sounds like you're dealing with both the potential obsolescence of skills you've already mastered and the risk of investing in new skills that might not be needed.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Given everything you've shared about the current limitations and your concerns about skill development?

User: I think this relationship will evolve as the capabilities of AI evolve; I'm a very logical person, so will continue to avoid AI for the complex stuff for as long as I see it as more of a hinderance than a benefit. The moment this changes, I'll integrate it fully into my workflow; my skills are a matter of pride, but there are always skills an AI can't master, to be present in the moment with a person and sell the idea well.

AI: That's such a pragmatic approach - waiting for that clear tipping point where it becomes more benefit than hindrance. And your point about being present in the moment and selling ideas well really highlights those uniquely human skills that seem to remain central to your work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that balance between efficiency and maintaining authenticity, and how you've developed such specific collaborative techniques to get better results.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of! This was an interesting conversation, thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between efficiency and authenticity, the collaborative approaches you've developed, and especially your thoughts on skill development in this rapidly changing landscape will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and limitations you've experienced. Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
