Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions from me, lets go

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to brainstorm ideas that would usually take far too long to do with an alternative search engine. Additionally, I give AI complex topics to quickly solve if I don't have the time to solve it myself. And finally I use AI to explain complex topics that I am learning in a simple, more readable way.

AI: That's really helpful context. I'm curious to dig a bit deeper into that second point you mentioned - when you give AI complex topics to solve when you don't have time to solve them yourself.

Can you walk me through what one of those situations looks like? What kind of complex topic might come up, and how do you decide it's something to hand off to AI rather than tackle yourself?

User: For example, if I am wondering how I would solve a molar concentration of a certain volume of a substance. Instead of manually completing the calculation myself, I would input the query into AI for a quick answer. I usually give AI problems to solve that I know I can answer myself but AI could do it faster.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI as a time-saver for problems you're confident you could solve yourself. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from something like that molar concentration calculation?

User: Tasks I prefer to carry out myself is reading papers. I could give AI the paper and ask it to explain it for me, however this has proven inaccurate at times. Therefore I always make sure to read the paper myself, and summarise, and analyse it myself. The difference between a molar concentration is that its more basic. AI seems to be accurate with these sort of numerical problems. However, AI has shown significant issues with regards to reading and interpreting whole papers. Thus, for accuracy I read them myself, even though it takes more time.

AI: That distinction between basic numerical problems and complex paper analysis is really insightful. It sounds like you've developed a sense of where AI's reliability breaks down.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For instance, with those molar concentration problems - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the calculation, or do you tend to give it the problem and let it handle the whole thing independently?

User: I tend to give it them whole problem, but I ask it to break it down to each step. This enables me to scan the break down quickly, and determine that the process is accurate and correct.

AI: That's a smart approach - getting the full solution but with transparency into the steps. It sounds like you've found a way to balance efficiency with verification.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: Yes, they tend to use it similarly. Many use it for research, and numerical issues, writing emails, and admin.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was using AI at one point to summarise a paper that I had a limited time frame to read. I had taken its output at face value, and assumed it would be correct. However, after taking this outputted data and creating a presentation with it, I then determined that the data had incorporated hallucinated statements. This lead to me having to read the whole paper again, significantly reducing my available time, and significantly reducing my trust in AI - which was very frustrating.

AI: That sounds like a really frustrating experience - especially having to redo work under time pressure and discovering you couldn't rely on something you thought would save you time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Given that experience with the paper, is this something you actively consider?

User: I am of the strong opinion that humans should maintain and develop the skills that AI could potentially take over. As from my previous experience, AI has far to go, and without knowing having the skills myself then I would not of been able to identify the error and correct it.

AI: That makes complete sense given what you experienced. Your ability to catch that error really depended on having the underlying skills yourself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see your approach changing as the technology develops, or do you think you'll maintain this careful, verification-focused way of working with it?

User: I will definitely maintain my way of working with AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining human skills as a way to verify AI outputs - that lesson from the paper summarization experience really highlights how important that verification step can be.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between efficiency and accuracy, and how that paper incident shaped your approach to verification, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
