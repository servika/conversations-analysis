Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me. Please proceed.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work at a law firm as a legal assistant. Our firm specializes mainly in insurance defence law. I use AI to summarize reports to client by scanning the reports to see if there are any instructions I must create tasks for or attachments to be added to the reports.
I also use AI to create lists of deadlines for all of my tasks and reports coming up. Basically, I use AI to assist me with administrative tasks.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI as a scanning and organizational tool for managing information flow and deadlines.

When you're having AI summarize those reports for clients, can you walk me through what that process looks like? Do you review and edit what the AI produces, or does it typically capture what you need right away?

User: No, I do not need to review and edit what the AI produces. I am simply scanning the final report (approved by the lawyer, that I do not and should not edit or change once it has been finalized) for next steps for myself so that I can input the appropriate tasks into our law firm software, ACL5. Therefore, it captures what I need and provides me with tasks I will need to follow up on.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using it to extract actionable next steps from finalized documents rather than creating client-facing content.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I handle drafting emails to clients and our insured representatives on my own. I feel it gives a personal touch and I am so used to communicating with these clients on my own that I don't feel I need to pass it off to AI. It would take me the same amount of time to input the information into an AI platform as it would to type an email to the client, so I don't see the point in duplicating the work for myself.

AI: That's interesting - you're weighing both efficiency and the personal connection aspect. It sounds like for communication, the time investment doesn't justify using AI, plus you value that direct relationship with clients.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Correct. I don't feel the need to incorporate AI in that aspect of my job.

If there are a lot of tasks or instructions, I will copy and paste a majority of the report into AI once I have skimmed the complete report. I suppose that means that I collaborate with AI throughout a task because I always have to review the report first. There may not be any present instructions in a report, so I make sure to skim the report first before using AI to waste any time. I don't need AI to search for instructions that do not exist.

AI: That's a smart approach - doing that initial skim to determine if AI would even be useful before engaging it. 

So you're essentially doing a preliminary assessment, then bringing AI in as a focused partner for the extraction work when there's actually content to extract. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: AI is new to our firm and just coming to light in beta-testing form. It is not yet approved to be used by the firm, and even the lawyers must obtain client approval prior to using AI for research or drafting purposes. There have been some instances in court where a lawyer has used AI and hallucinated cases in their references, so our firm has been skeptical and slow to integrate AI into our practice.

AI: That's a really important context - operating in a cautious environment where AI use isn't officially sanctioned yet, especially given those court cases with hallucinated references.

Given that backdrop, can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have felt satisfied using AI at work when it has successfully helped me streamline tasks and due dates by extracting the information from reports. I have not been using AI at work for very long, so I haven't yet come across a frustrating situation with AI.

AI: That satisfaction with the streamlining makes sense - it sounds like AI is delivering on efficiency for those specific administrative tasks.

Since you mentioned you haven't been using it very long, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have thought about this a little bit, but not a lot. A part of me worries AI could take over a number of administrative tasks, making legal assistant jobs more difficult to find or hold on to. I still think maintaining client communication on a personal, more intimate level is important and is preferred by some people. Certain connections have been built over the years and that cannot be replaced by AI.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - recognizing both the potential displacement risk while also identifying the irreplaceable value of those long-term client relationships you've built.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect AI to continue to flourish and become a useful, first-hand tool for many types of businesses. Administrative tasks can be tedious, time consuming and repetitive, therefore AI could certainly assist with efficiency in that aspect. Once our firm is more comfortable using AI, and we have been given permission to integrate AI use on a regular day-to-day basis, there will be opportunities to streamline tasks, ensure we never miss deadlines, and assist lawyers in perhaps conducting research and preparing court documents that assistants otherwise could not assist with.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance efficiency gains with maintaining those personal client relationships, and your measured approach to AI adoption in a cautious legal environment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That is all I have to share for today. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in a regulated environment like law, and how you thoughtfully distinguish between tasks that benefit from AI efficiency versus those that require human connection, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
