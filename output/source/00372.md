Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds fine to me :)

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So currently AI could be used for all kinds of things but mostly I use it for drafting emails that will then be tweaked and sent back to parents. Sometimes its used for emails to other members of staff. I use the AI that is built into outlook for this because it is pretty good but also due to GDPR we are limited on the bots we can use when discussing students.

AI: That's really helpful context about the GDPR considerations. It sounds like you work in education and communicate with parents regularly.

When you say you draft emails with AI and then tweak them before sending - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? What kinds of adjustments do you usually find yourself making?

User: So I'll give a concrete example as it was quite typical and is probably the most helpful. A nice parent that has a child with additional needs sent a message to myself and several other members of staff so we had her perspective on her daughters needs. I then asked the AI to draft an email that was warm, professional and grateful for her email that reassures the parent shes been heard and that I am confident the daughter will be okay. It did this but included a few extra bits and pieces that didn't make sense in the full context so I removed them and then sent the message. It porbably saved me about 10-15 mins as I didn't have to spend so much time creating the email. The parent then replied with their thanks so all in all a win.

AI: That sounds like a really positive outcome. You mentioned the AI included some extra bits that didn't make sense in the full context - what kind of things were those? I'm curious about what you found yourself needing to edit out.

User: It was something about saying that the pupil had qualities they didn't have and it was obviously not a good fit for them. something like how they were outspoken and confident in the lessons which isn't the case, they are quiet, hard working and considered.

AI: That's a really clear example of where your professional judgment was essential. The AI got the tone right but missed the mark on the specific student details.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, so when it comes to making work sheets or lesson design I'm doing it myself. Basically I find that for activities there are already a wealth of created resources available to me and AI never quite hits the mark. When it comes to overall lesson design again AI can't really compete with my judgement as I know the school, the kids, the curriculum and how I like to teach in a way that the AI just doesn't. Although maybe with the right set up, initial prompt and what have you, that could be changed.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like the more context-specific and pedagogical the task, the more you rely on your own expertise. You mentioned that with the right setup or initial prompt, AI might be able to help more with lesson design.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Thinking back to the earlier email example it tends to be that some sort of communication stimulus has come through that needs a response, from that point on its a collaborate job until it is complete. Because the communications are directed at people I wouldn't put my name to anything that had not been read through properly.

AI: That makes perfect sense - especially when your name is going on communications with parents and colleagues. So it sounds like it's very much a collaborative process rather than full delegation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: a lot of my colleagues are yet to embrace the benefits of AI, although they are now cottoning on to some of what I do. There is a team that has been put together recently that is there to explore the use of AI and find good classroom applications so I guess we will see what they turn up.

AI: So you're somewhat of an early adopter compared to your colleagues. That's interesting that there's now a dedicated team exploring AI applications.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm going to choose frustrated and again it was recently. Within google classroom there is a quiz setting function. So I set it to task with some work on complex numbers, which it did quite well except for it's inability to render LaTeX correctly which then made it an unusable waste of time. I could have written one myself faster.

AI: That's a great example of where the technical limitations really got in the way. The LaTeX rendering issue essentially negated all the time you thought you'd save.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This isn't something I worry about. AI is a tool and it will need to be wielded by someone to be effective, if I am not skilled in an area then I cannot tell if the AI is doing good work or not so it becomes unusable.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - that your expertise is what makes AI useful rather than replaceable. You need the skills to evaluate whether the AI's output is actually good.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I do, I think it is going to get more refined so that it can automate processes within our information management systems. I suspect its lesson planning and resource creation will get better over time. Whilst I personally do not struggle to meet the demands of my workload there are many teachers that do and it could be a great help to them.

AI: That's a really generous way to think about it - seeing AI as potentially helping colleagues who are struggling with workload even if you personally manage fine.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your expertise is essential for evaluating AI output - that really struck me as a key insight about the collaborative nature of this relationship.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope, I think we have had a productive chat. How do I end this interview?

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI use, the importance of professional judgment, and how technical limitations can impact effectiveness will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

The interview is now complete - you can simply close this conversation whenever you're ready. Thanks again for participating!
