Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently, I am using AI for a couple of tasks in my day-to-day. I use it to help with copywriting content for website mock-ups, specifically creating placeholder content for FAQs, body copy, event copy and offer copy.  In my role, as a UX/UI designer, I am often redesigning client websites which are out of date, so the content they have on their live sites is usually in need of reworking. Our copywriting team begins their process once we have approved designs, so I will take the copy from old sites, when available, and ask AI to rewrite it to match the brand's new tone of voice or update it to fit with the new AI structure we have set.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI as a bridge between the old content and the new design direction while you're waiting for the copywriting team to take over.

When you're working with that existing copy and asking AI to rewrite it for the new tone or structure, what does that process typically look like for you? Do you feed it all the content at once, or do you work through it section by section?

User: I will feed it parts I need rewritten, for example, I'll give it the new set of instructions on how the copy should align with branding at the beginning of a conversation and then input groups of copy, like the current page heading, intro, section headings and card copy and see how it does. I'll then ask it to update the new copy for my mock-ups by either reducing the length or fixing some keywords I know the client will want changed, even if it is primarily a placeholder. I also find AI helpful for rewriting client feedback from our presentation call transcripts or internal reviews, among other, less frequent uses.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow you've developed. It sounds like you've found a way to work collaboratively with AI - giving it the brand guidelines upfront and then iterating on specific sections.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The biggest thing I would rather do myself, even though the design programs I use have AI options, is building the final design and feel of pages for a site, the home page in particular. I've tried using AI to help me speed up the process, but currently, the designs have a very generic feel in both look and flow that don't meet the standards our client expects. I've noticed that when asking AI to build a homepage with the required layouts needed to address all of the key site features and branding, they will still fall back to overly structured card grids or stacked split layouts that lack unique visual features. It seems to use a few standard designs and cut them together, as opposed to when I, as a designer, will look at the branding, find elements that set them apart, and create cohesion between their new site and existing collateral to rework a more "standard" component or layout to elevate what the user will see when they land on the site, making an impact and setting our clients apart from the websites of their competition.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're drawing. It sounds like AI can handle more modular, content-focused work where there are clearer parameters, but struggles with the kind of creative synthesis you do - pulling together branding elements, competitive differentiation, and that cohesive vision that makes a site feel distinctive rather than templated.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: For simple things like extracting feedback or creating a list of action items from transcripts, I will delegate this to the AI, since I don't find it misses things often enough to need my input. When it comes to either rewriting old copy to use as a placeholder in new designs, starting the lo-fi wire process and taking the data from our discovery phase to begin mapping out the new site's IA, I will always collaborate with the model on the work. Where these items will eventually be presented to the clients in some way, it's important to ensure nothing slips through the cracks or is missed. In these cases, I find it more of a helper as I work, improving my productivity and reducing time spent on little things. For something like mapping out an IA site map, I'll input the data we sourced and have the AI clean it up. Then I will start working with the AI to create a hierarchy of information, which often means I have to request edits to the first few initial passes until the structure is almost done, then I will finish off and proofread it before setting it into a client-facing review hub.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - it sounds like you've developed a clear sense of when you can trust AI to work independently versus when you need that back-and-forth collaboration, especially for anything client-facing.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: It's been about a year since we started working with AI slowly, mainly for smaller personal tasks, but over the past 6 months, we've been encouraged to explore how we can use different models to improve our workflow. My CCO was a big reason why I started exploring how I could use AI to enhance my mocks, pushing my team to try using them for any copy we may need before presentations, since this small element can make a huge difference in how the client first approaches the design, not being distracted by Lorem Ipsum.

AI: That's really interesting - so it sounds like your CCO was proactive about encouraging AI adoption, particularly for improving client presentations. The point about clients being distracted by Lorem Ipsum is something I hadn't thought about, but that makes complete sense from a presentation perspective.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time I tried using AI to create a set of lo-fi wireframes to present to a client was extremely frustrating. I had a lot of work on my plate, so I wanted to try giving the AI a structured list of layout options, the details of what each page required, options to use on lighter pages to help with SEO and avoiding orphans, but the results were so bad I had to scrap nearly everything and build them all out myself. It didn't severely impact the amount of time I would have spent on the wires had I just done it myself from the beginning, but the idea that I would have extra time to work on other sites in my list was something I had been excited about.

AI: That sounds really disappointing, especially when you had put time into structuring your requirements and had hopes for it freeing up time for other projects.

Tell me more about what made those wireframe results so unusable. What specifically wasn't working about what the AI produced?

User: There were major inconsistencies with the page flows; some pages missed key elements. For example, I had instructed it to include a layout for in-room amenities, key features of the room before the intro, but after the page header, a highlighting image gallery, on-page booking widget, 50-50 layout for two key resort amenities and a callback to other room options on the "room details" page. But what it gave me was a structured 3-up card grid with cards for each of these things and a standard intro paragraph. Other pages had mix-ups of layouts, a 50-50 split when I asked for a 3-up card carousel or adding an info sidecar on pages that had no need for contact/hours/booking CTAs. I felt like I had overloaded it with information that resulted in wires that I couldn't use, and just moved forward with my standard procedure for building them out.

AI: That really illustrates the difference between AI following instructions versus understanding the strategic purpose behind design decisions. It sounds like it treated your layout requirements more like a checklist to reorganize rather than understanding the user flow and hierarchy you were trying to create.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not overly concerned. I personally feel that it's my responsibility to continue learning in my field by taking courses to improve my knowledge and always reviewing what others are doing. In design, there are so many ways to get to the end product that requires working collaboratively with them and extracting ideas from their feedback that they are unable to articulate. I don't see AI as taking over my job, but as something that will continue to help me in the future.

AI: That confidence in your collaborative skills and ability to extract and interpret client feedback makes a lot of sense - those are really human-centered skills that seem core to what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I do, I think eventually we will be able to delegate the production work, like refining the designs for different screen breakpoints and setting style guides for our dev teams as something we can have AI take care of. This will lead to more time for creative work, client research and branding work for the designers. I think it will be a key to allowing us to focus on what we truly love, the creative design process, and less on the more remedial work.

AI: That's a really optimistic vision - using AI to handle the more technical, production-heavy aspects so you can spend more time on the strategic and creative work that energizes you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI works well for modular tasks but struggles with that creative synthesis that makes designs distinctive, and your systematic approach to determining when to collaborate versus delegate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered everything. Thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced ways you've integrated AI into your UX/UI workflow - from copy placeholder work to the challenges with wireframing - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've developed such a thoughtful approach to knowing when and how to work with AI tools. Have a great rest of your day!
