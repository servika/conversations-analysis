Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This all sounds good. I am ready to begin!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: One of the primary ways I use AI is to write standard emails that do not require a lot of specific information. I also rely on AI to summarize meetings and complex emails that others send me.

AI: That's helpful to understand. Tell me more about those standard emails - what makes them good candidates for AI assistance?

User: They are the kind of emails that I send often, and take up a lot of time if I write them all out manually. AI helps cut down on that time.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, since I work in corrections, anything that deals with an inmate's PII is handled without using AI, to ensure their privacy.

AI: That makes complete sense from a privacy standpoint. Beyond those privacy-sensitive tasks, are there other types of work you prefer to keep for yourself even when AI could potentially assist?

User: Picking books for the prison's library is something I like to rely on myself for, since I have a master's in library science.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Usually, since it's a one-time task (writing a simple email, summarizing meeting minutes, etc.), it tends to be the latter.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: [REDACTED] policy actually prohibits reliance on AI in many tasks, so I only feel comfortable using the built-in AI tools offered by Gmail.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - working within those policy constraints. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently had to record lectures for a digital literacy class. Google Gemini created notes for the video lectures without me even having to ask, which made going over the content of the videos afterwards easier, making sure I did not miss any essential points.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's something I worry about - though, more for my children than myself. I do not foresee AI taking over corrections in the near future, but I wonder what the job landscape will look like by the time my children, who are still minors, will face by the time they get ready to enter the job force.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it depends on if the leadership in charge of the [REDACTED] changes. Right now, they are very technology-adverse, so I do not think it will expand any time soon. But if leadership changes, those attitudes may change with it, and I can see routine tasks being handled more often by AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how organizational policies shape AI adoption and your concerns about the future job landscape for your children.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered it all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use within policy constraints, the automatic features that surprised you, and your thoughtful perspective on the generational implications have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thank you, you as well!

AI: Thank you! It was really a pleasure speaking with you. Take care!
