Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, we can start

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: It's easier to describe how AI fits into my typical workweek since I do not use it daily. During my work in video game development, I use AI primarily for 3 kinds of tasks.

First, I'll use it to brainstorm ideas. If I need help naming a character or area in the game, coming up with quest ideas, suggesting different accessibility features I may have overlooked, or ways to improve certain game mechanics, I'll use AI as a quick tool to get some ideas to draw inspiration from. 

Second, with programming help. I am fairly comfortable with programming, mainly in Unity, but it is not my area of expertise. I will not be programming every day, or even every week, but I may need help solving programming issues or analyzing code to see what changes need to be made. 

Third, for general feedback and improvements. When it comes to getting feedback with any kind of creative product, asking friends/relatives generally results in feedback of "that's cool" which is not always helpful. I will occasionally ask AI for honest feedback about what is good or bad about a piece of art, writing, or design, and have it recommend improvements for me. Of course, I will use my best judgement here since they are not always relevant or helpful, though it can be useful to get an honest opinion from a different point of view.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found some specific niches where AI adds value to your game development work. 

I'm curious about that third point you mentioned regarding feedback. When you're seeking that honest feedback on your creative work, what does that interaction typically look like? Do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI, or do you usually get what you need from that initial response?

User: It's definitely a back and forth for the most part. For example, if I wanted to improve a character's dialog, it is unlikely that I will use the first suggestion it offers. I will give it additional context, such as the character's personality or actions in the game that led to this line of dialog in the first place, though I'll always make my own final changes to the dialog in the end.

AI: That's a really helpful example. It sounds like you're very intentional about maintaining creative control while using AI as a sounding board.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Generally I would prefer to do most of the creative tasks myself. I enjoy coming up with ideas for a game, or trying to work through different problems. It would be easy to have AI write out a series of dialogs for me, but it's unlikely to completely fulfill my goals/needs, so I'd rather do most of that work myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like the creative problem-solving is part of what you enjoy about the work itself.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you lean more toward collaborating with it throughout a task rather than handing off complete tasks. Is that accurate, or does it vary depending on what you're working on?

User: That sounds accurate. It is very rare that I will ask a question or have a request that gets immediately fulfilled in the first response from an AI. I almost always have to ask follow-up questions, give it additional context, or have it make changes to reach my goal for that conversation.

Typically, I'll ask a general question, have the AI respond, and then give it all the extra information it needs to refine the response further until I have what I need.

AI: That iterative approach you describe - starting general and then layering in more specific context - sounds like you've developed a pretty refined process for working with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team use it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: That's not something I've discussed in depth before, though I imagine AI is used the same way that I do, to an extent. There may be different tasks I get help from AI with compared to someone else, but I feel that it's fairly similar overall. Our only shared principal is to not use exclusively AI content in a final product, such as art, which is immediately noticeable.

AI: That's an interesting principle your team has established about not using exclusively AI content, especially for art.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'll give you an example for both. For feeling satisfied, I was having an issue with the day/night cycle in the game, where I couldn't get the moon to rotate the right way, so the shadows were either backwards or the moon was out at the wrong time altogether. I spent several hours trying to solve the problem until I asked AI for help, and within 5 minutes, I had the problem fixed. For feeling frustrated, there have been times when I was setting up an enemy that would not behave the way I wanted, and AI would offer some code that it guaranteed was tested and working, and despite several hours trying to fix the issue using its "tested and working" code, I couldn't get it to work.

AI: Those are such vivid examples of the highs and lows! The moon rotation solution sounds like exactly the kind of breakthrough that makes AI feel invaluable, while that "tested and working" code situation sounds incredibly frustrating.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think it will be a problem, at least not for a long time to be concerned about. Even if AI could take over certain aspects, for example, writing, a good writer is still needed to confirm if the AI writing is any good. It does not seem possible that an AI could entirely take over the game development process, though it could make certain parts simpler.

AI: That perspective about still needing human judgment to evaluate quality makes sense, especially given your experience with that "tested and working" code that didn't actually work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, differently, or staying pretty much the same?

User: I think my use of AI will remain pretty much the same. The only reason I would use it less is if the quality of the AI responses becomes drastically worse, to the point where they are no longer helpful. Otherwise, I use it about as much as I would like.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI as a collaborative sounding board while maintaining creative control, and that concrete example about the moon rotation problem versus the frustrating "tested and working" code.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I'm good, thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative nature of working with AI, the importance of maintaining creative control, and those specific examples of both successful and frustrating interactions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
