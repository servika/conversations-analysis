Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! No questions, I am ready to begin

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: As a student researcher, many of my project themes are decided for me. The initial idea came from my supervisor, who was looking to study growth hormone in rodents at different periods of time. This project was very heavy on both preparation and data analysis, because the main part of the analysis of the rodents unfortunately required histological brain images. As a student, I had to learn appropriate handling of lab mice, as well as the procedures which were necessary for the project. This is where I used quite a bit of AI to help me. I would frequently use AI to both help me learn, and to help me recall some of the techniques I had learned during my Undergraduate studies. These techniques were either for handling the lab mice, or for research techniques, like running a centrifuge or running immunofluorescence assays. The final output was the data analysis, for which I used a small amount of AI only for organization and summarization, rarely (if ever) for actual analysis.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you turned to AI primarily during the learning and preparation phases. 

Tell me more about how you used AI to help you learn the lab techniques. What did that actually look like in practice?

User: As one of the more inexperienced researchers in the lab, I felt the need to rely on step by step instructions for certain lab techniques. One instance I remember well was the preparation of a polyacrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE. I needed to prepare a gel, and later run it. I was on a pretty tight time constraint for this task as well, so I asked for the help of AI for a step-by-step instruction on how to make the polyacrylamide gel, and then another one of how to run the SDS-PAGE. I had given the AI as much information as possible for background information, like prior lab notes and excerpts from lab textbooks, but I requested explicitly a step-by-step guide, because at the time I was feeling a bit lost.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that step-by-step guidance when you're under time pressure and feeling uncertain must have been reassuring.

When you were deciding whether to ask AI for those instructions versus asking a lab mate or looking it up in a protocol book, what made you choose the AI route?

User: I had been on a roll of using AI quite a bit at this point of the project, and I was appreciating the consistency. I wanted to use the project to learn, and there were several tasks which I would ask for help from my supervisor or one of my lab mates for assistance, namely when making histological slides. The protocol book had not yielded good results for me, so while I was looking on my computer for some of my old notes, I had AI tabs open and I decided to use a bit of prompt engineering. One of the major reasons I appreciate AI is because it is more malleable. My notes and the protocol book are set in stone, however I am able to get AI to rephrase or to go in depth on something specific within seconds.

AI: That's a great insight about the malleability being a key advantage - being able to get immediate clarification or different explanations on demand.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Let me shift focus a bit - you mentioned you used AI less for the actual data analysis phase. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI much, what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I havent used AI for data analysis because I am unsure of the results it will yield, and the only way to confirm/deny the results from AI is to repeat the work myself, so it feels pointless to ask an AI. I feel this to be the case for subjective things, like data analysis, analysis of results and charts and things like that, because an AI can so easily misinterpret data, or numbers or reading a chart that it feels too risky. I feel this for clinical analysis as well, such as histological slides, X-rays or CT-scans. I have not tried it for two reasons, the first being I will have to do the work to determine if the AI is correct or not, and two because using AI will not help me learn, it will just give me the answer.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - between tasks where AI can help you learn versus tasks where you need to develop your own analytical skills.

When you have used AI for those step-by-step procedures like the SDS-PAGE, how do you verify or validate what it produces? How do you know you can trust those instructions?

User: SDS-PAGE and other procedures are set in stone. There are no real variables, subjectivity or interpretation to be done. The AI can easily absorb information of how to perform an SDS-PAGE and repeat it back in a different format (such as a step by step procedure) which allows me to trust it more. The analysis of an SDS-PAGE will be done by myself, but I trust AI to help me with the preparation, which is much more low stakes,, and easy to confirm by the success of the experiment so if it doesn't work I can simply redo it.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the procedural steps have clear success or failure outcomes that validate whether the AI guidance worked.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I use AI a lot for writing and brainstorming, helping me choose techniques and research methods to follow through on hypotheses I or another researcher have formulated. If I had a magic wand, it would be definitely improvement of AI brainstorming capabilities, by diving into the unknown and helping us with the formation of these hypotheses. There are many disease mechanisms we do not fully understand, so if we could use AI to help us formulate new hypotheses or new lab techniques to help us, it may speed up the discovery of novel mechanisms which may be able to stop diseases. The other would also be data analysis, being able to string together several pieces of data to formulate a conclusion. Whether it be statistical data, or previously mentioned physical data like medical imagery. This would facilitate patient care and accelerate research.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how you distinguish between procedural tasks where AI can be trusted versus analytical tasks that require human judgment were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think we've touched on just about everything for my research work!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how the "set in stone" nature of lab procedures makes them ideal for AI assistance, while the subjective aspects of data analysis require human expertise, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

Your point about wanting AI to eventually help with hypothesis formation and connecting disparate data points also gives us valuable perspective on where you see the most exciting potential for advancement.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
