Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions. Let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a short film screenwriter. So I typically work on screenplays that are about 15-20 pages. I write drama, romance, thrillers. There is one project I was working on that's significantly longer though. A feature film but that's more of a passion project than anything.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating range of work. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I mostly use AI for feedback and sometimes continuing when I have writer's block. So, typically I will have started a scene or started with an idea and I go to AI to bounce off what direction I'd like to take it. If I get a scene written by AI, I'll take that framework and re-work it to fit my voice and style.

AI: That's really interesting how you use it as both a sounding board and a way to break through blocks. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yeah, I was working on a drama/ romance kind of script. So first I described each of the characters personalities to the model and asked for name ideas. That was really great because the name to me is pretty important, it tells the audience a little before they know anything, in my opinion at least. It's human nature to judge a book by it's cover. The model did a great job with the names. Later, I gave the model the general idea of the story and asked if it thought I needed comic relief within a pretty serious script. We discussed why or why not. This was one of the areas I wish more people could or would use AI for. It was like having another writer in the room to weigh pros and cons with. After I finished the script, I sent it to the model to read over and give me it's opinion. The entire process was really efficient. I got through a 20 page script, start to finish in a little over 12 hours by just partnering with the model and getting quick feedback.

AI: That's a really compelling example - it sounds like the AI served almost as a creative collaborator throughout multiple stages. When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The decisions are mine so I'd describe it almost like an assistant writer but maybe even less than that. I'm asking for feedback and framework ideas and then I run with it. Also of course, proofreading, editing. But ultimately, it has to be my voice so I feel in control the entire time just with more of a support system instead of in a box.

AI: That's a great way to put it - having support instead of being in a box. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The worldliness of it. There are things I learn from AI to incorporate. For example, in the feature script I mentioned earlier, the protagonist travels to several countries I've never visited. AI helped me describe these places, the language, the culture more vividly and authentically. So it's expanded my reach I guess. I feel less limited.

AI: That expansion of reach sounds really valuable - being able to authentically portray places and cultures you haven't experienced firsthand. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I don't have the fear that many writers do about AI taking over. I think people know what's real. I do. When I watch films or a series, it's clear to me when a writer's heart is not in it. I don't think those who use AI to write whole scripts without heavy human influence pose a real threat. It's like reality tv, when it's real and authentic, the shows hit. When the show becomes scripted, it falls apart. So, I believe in human discernment. I don't have concerns.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective about authenticity and human discernment. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think AI will be more like how I use it. It wouldn't replace whole writers rooms but instead be a partner. It will expand the reach of writers. It'll work as a tool, just like a computer or camera.
