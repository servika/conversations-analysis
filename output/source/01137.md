Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes let's begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a commission artist as well as an art workshop facilitator. One of my latest classes I have offered is a Fall themed Mom & Me Paint Night. I advertise, people sign up, and I run the class in a rented studio. I also am a therapeutic art life coach and I offer free art journaling prompts on my social media along with therapeutic art bundles for purchase.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse and meaningful creative practice - I can see how you're working across different formats from hands-on workshops to digital content creation and coaching.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: When I am looking for ways to grow my social media following, engagement and reach, I have asked AI what the best practices are. I have also asked for inspiration about types of content bundles I can offer, as well as descriptions for workshops.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI more on the business and marketing side of your creative work rather than in the actual art-making process itself.

Can you describe a specific recent example where you used AI for one of these purposes? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I recently used AI to help me think of content bundle ideas. I found it actually very helpful and was impressed by the ideas. I took inspiration from 3 of the ideas it came up with and adapted them into my own offering. It was nice to have the inspiration, but I admit I feel hesitant when using AI for creative ideas.

AI: Tell me more about that hesitation you feel when using AI for creative ideas.

User: I don't want to form a habit of relying on AI for my creative ideas. I want them to come from my own creative thought process.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective. When you say you took inspiration from 3 of the AI ideas and adapted them into your own offering, what did that adaptation process look like for you? How did you make those ideas your own?

User: I took the general idea of each, for example, one bundle idea was about doing art with the changing seasons, and I took another idea I had previously and combined it with the AI one. It became "Syncing with the Seasons" taking an idea I had about syncing your natural rhythms to your art practice. It was just the right amount of inspiration I needed to make another idea I had make sense

AI: That sounds like a really organic creative process - using AI as a catalyst that helped you connect dots between your own existing ideas. 

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I feel like I am in control because I can have the AI change or add whatever I ask for. When I first ask for the ideas, though, the responses are usually quite thorough and giving a whole break down of the content, which I'm not sure I like. Because at that point, AI has come up with a complete idea for you to just use, rather than using your own creative thought to complete the idea.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - between AI giving you a spark versus handing you a fully formed concept. It sounds like you prefer when AI gives you that initial nudge rather than the complete roadmap.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think moving more to an online platform has been my biggest change since working with AI. I do not use AI for my actual art prompts, but I have found it really helpful with social media tips and content ideas to generate passive income.

AI: So it sounds like AI has helped facilitate that shift toward building an online presence and passive income streams. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field - both in the therapeutic art space and the broader art world?

User: My concern with the therapeutic part is that AI can essentially become an online counsellor, which I don't believe it is nearly ready for, or should ever be in that space for that matter. I have seen a lot of examples of AI overly agreeing with someone's perspective and making them feel like they are a victim rather than taking responsibility. In the broader art world, I fear people will rely too much on AI to come up with creative ideas. I have already seen so much AI generated art that people are using and selling. It is easy to spot. Although it may look cool, it defeats the purpose of being an artist. Humans are innately creative and have used art to communicate since the beginning of time. I am concerned that AI will take over the creative thinking process for humans, which leads to a break down of critical thinking skills, and communication skills.

AI: Those are really profound concerns, especially around the therapeutic aspects and the fundamental human need for creative expression. You've touched on something important about AI potentially interfering with both personal growth processes and broader human development.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll continue using it in similar ways, or do you envision that changing?

User: I don't see my use of it changing much. The temptation to use AI to generate ideas is becoming more and more popular - highly successful individuals in the social media marketing scene often suggest using it for posts, content creation, automation, etc. I believe if I can avoid the temptation, especially in a social media space that can be so competitive, I will continue to use AI strictly for inspiration or refinement of my own ideas, as well as social media marketing advice.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to maintain that boundary between using AI for inspiration versus letting it do the complete creative thinking for you - that distinction seems really important to how you preserve your own creative agency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we've covered it. Just a reinforcement that my personal belief is that AI should be used for inspiration, not to completely take over the creative process.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative autonomy while still finding practical value in AI, especially around the business side of creative work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached this balance, and your concerns about preserving the fundamentally human aspects of both creativity and therapeutic work are valuable perspectives for us to consider.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!

User: Thank you Claude!

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you so much for participating - your insights were really valuable. Take care!
