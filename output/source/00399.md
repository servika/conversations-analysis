Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good to me!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: At the moment, AI is not a major tool in my typical workday. I am a manager in the hospitality industry, and currently my usage is primarily focused on creative writing tasks and fact checking. This would either be for product descriptions for food and drink POS, writing social media content, or drafting memos and notifications to staff. There is certainly room for expansion with AI tech in the hospitality industry!

AI: That's really interesting that you're using AI for those creative and communication tasks in hospitality. Tell me more about the product descriptions and social media content - what does that process typically look like for you when you're working with AI on those?

User: Most frequently, this would be aimed at new drinks products on our guest ale list. I would ask AI to generate a short, informative description of the flavour profile of the product to add to the taste notes board, which saves time that can be used to focus on more pressing customer service and food hygiene related tasks. We've also used it to identify whether certain coins were legal tender, as occasionally rogue coins will be accepted and must be vetted before they are added back into the tills or banking. Its also handy for changing a summary of KPIs and focus points into staff memos, to ensure all members of the kitchen and service teams are on the same page.

AI: That's fascinating - the coin verification use case is something I wouldn't have expected! When you're working on these tasks, like creating those drink descriptions or converting KPI summaries into staff memos, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI to refine the output, or do you typically give it the task and use what it produces?

User: Typically I would take the AI response, then proofread it and amend it myself. Occasionally I will provide feedback and ask the AI to redo or refine a task, but typically this would only be if the content is significantly wide of the mark.

AI: That makes sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are elements that I prefer to do for myself. Usually, this would be in tasks where there is a significant repercussion if something went wrong. Writing health and safety SOPs, for example. While it would be easier and significantly less time consuming if I entrusted an AI to generate a document, it would be me that would be culpable if something went wrong, potentially leaving myself exposed to lose my job or cause harm to someone else. I prefer to be in control of the entire process, in those scenarios, and adhere to the formats and support packs provided by head office.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making about risk and accountability. It sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where that line is for you. When you mentioned health and safety SOPs specifically - what is it about having control of the entire process that feels important to you in those high-stakes situations?

User: I feel I would be more prone to laziness if I were to rely on AI for those kinds of tasks. If I were providing an information sheet on allergens, for example, and just input the product information into an LLM and amended the output I am more likely to miss off some key information than if I compile the document manually and tick off each key piece of information as I incorporate it into the document. A typical bar associate who does not have access to the information I did while making the document would rightly assume that the document contained all allergen information, and provide inaccurate information to someone with an allergy. This could have a significant impact on somebody's health. Therefore, I should take full responsibility for the output of the document from start to finish.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - the idea that the manual process keeps you more engaged and less likely to miss critical details. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team use it similarly, or have you had discussions about where it fits in?

User: AI is not something that typically comes up in our day to day communication, because our roles within the pub typically rely on face to face customer interaction, food and drink preparation, and manual tasks. My colleagues have less need to use AI in their daily roles, and has had limited impact on work place culture. The most frequent use within my teams would be the preparation of written text for social media posts advertising pub events, special's boards, and new products or promotions. However, we do not actively promote or condemn the use of assistive technology in this task, so our creative team have free license to make their own personal choices in how they complete their tasks.

AI: That's a really balanced approach you've described. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the most satisfying examples would be when AI has generated tasting notes or information on a product that had not been provided to us by the suppliers. This saves a significant amount of time and effort researching products, and enables me to focus on the more pressing matters relating to business management.

AI: That sounds like a great time-saver when suppliers don't provide that information. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This doesn't concern me at all. The way I see LLM usage is similar to the invention of the calculator. When the calculator become a universal tool carried by everyone, it has actively improved lives and accuracy of personal numerical comprehension. While it can provide instant mathematical answers, it still relies on the user asking the right equation to get the right answer. Similarly, LLMs provide this kind of support for research and writing tasks. You still need to understand what you are asking the AI to complete, and you still need to ensure that it is provided with the correct formula to give you the answers you need. I am still able to answer maths equations without a calculator, and I am still able to write compelling social media copy or staff memos when needed, it just gives me the option not to when time is a factor.

AI: That's such an insightful analogy with the calculator - I really like how you frame it as needing to know the right question to ask. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it expanding into other areas, or staying pretty much where it is now?

User: What I would love to be able to use AI for in my day to day working life would involve integrating AI technology into the back office software my company uses, as it requires the input of PII and business finances. I would love to see an integrated rota checker that factors in staff holiday and availability, weekly peak trading times, and external influences. For example, an integrated AI that can identify that the typical Saturday lunch requires a team of 6 servers, but recognises when a local sports team are playing at home this goes up to 8 servers. It could flag the dates of the fixtures, consider other influences like a boost in trade on pay days, and ensure any holiday cover is factored in. This could also be used to track patterns in staff performance, noting when we receive better online feedback and correlating it with the staff members on shift to identify high performing staff. As well as this, it would be helpful to breakdown performance on our KPIs, such as better environmental practices, and less wastage or stock issues. However, due to head office policy, this would have to be integrated into our existing software, as we are prohibited from extracting staff and financial records. It could also be used by customers on our apps to track their product preferences and make personalised recommendations based on their previous purchases and the times they visit the business.

AI: Those are some really sophisticated applications you're envisioning - the idea of AI that can factor in all those variables like local sports fixtures, pay days, and staff performance patterns sounds incredibly useful for hospitality management. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your calculator analogy and how you think about risk and accountability in different types of tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I am happy we covered everything. Thanks for the opportunity to share my experiences.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the balance between efficiency and accountability, and your vision for more integrated AI solutions in hospitality, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
