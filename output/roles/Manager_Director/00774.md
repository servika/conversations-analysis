Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good. No, I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Retail, finding the best product substitutions when the customer's preferred product is unavailable and I am unfamiliar with its use or quality.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to help with product substitutions when you're not familiar with what the customer originally wanted. 

Tell me more about how that works for you. What does a typical interaction look like when you're trying to find a good substitute?

User: There is no direct interaction with the customer. I am shopping for them and have less than 60 seconds to make a decision on what to substitute for an item that is unavailable, if they do not specify a replacement by brand name.

AI: That's a really tight timeframe - less than 60 seconds to make that decision. 

Can you walk me through what happens in those moments? How do you actually use AI to help you figure out the best substitute when you're standing there in the store?

User: A typical question to the chatbot might be "What is the best substitute for Ghee?"

AI: I see - so you're asking direct, specific questions about product substitutions. 

What happens after you ask that question? How do you use the AI's response to make your final decision, especially given that 60-second time constraint?

User: If it answers "clarified butter," then I can ask for a recommendation for the best brand substitute. From there, I can check our inventory to see if we carry that brand.

AI: That makes sense - you're getting that quick guidance and then checking what's actually available in your store.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: That is the only task that I can use Ai for.

AI: Ah, I understand - so AI is specifically helpful for that product substitution challenge you face.

When you do use AI for those substitution questions, could you describe your interaction pattern? Are you having more of a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout the process, or are you asking it to give you a complete answer that you can then act on?

User: The answer has to be quick and direct, either I am needing a product type or a brand name.

AI: So you need those immediate, straightforward answers - no time for extended conversations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team use it similarly, or is this something you've figured out on your own?

User: Only a few of us use Ai before asking a manager of that department or scrolling through inventory.

AI: So you're among a smaller group who turns to AI first, while others go straight to asking managers or searching inventory.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustration is when the Ai totally misses the mark. We voice text with Ai more often than type, because it's faster. Even though I have a [REDACTED] accent, sometimes the Ai will respond to a request that was not even similar to what I asked for. If I try again, spelling out the word, sometimes I get a better response, sometimes I don't, so I just give up - having wasted precious time.

AI: That voice recognition issue sounds really frustrating, especially when every second counts in your situation.

Can you give me an example of a time when the AI totally missed the mark? What did you ask for versus what it thought you said?

User: In the case of the Ghee, it might give me information on a place, the meaning of a letter in an acronym, etc. The Ai either can't make out a word clearly/properly pronounced or doesn't recognize an item that is commonly called by a foreign name.

AI: That's really specific - so when you're asking about "Ghee," the AI might think you're asking about the letter "G" or some other completely unrelated thing. And it sounds like this happens particularly with items that have foreign names.

How do you think about maintaining your product knowledge in areas where AI could potentially help you learn more? Is building up that familiarity with different products something you actively consider?

User: There are 60,000 or more products in our store, and we are in an area with a large international population. Ghee I know from culinary experience, but there are too many items to be familiar with them all or to recall on a second's notice. If I am curious about a product, I might search for more information in my off-time if I remember what I had been looking earlier.

AI: Wow, 60,000 products and serving a diverse international community - that really puts the challenge in perspective. It makes complete sense why you'd turn to AI for those quick answers about unfamiliar products.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it continuing to help in this same way, or do you think there might be other ways it could be useful for your work?

User: I don't see it evolving into other areas. This is all we can use it for.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you navigate those 60-second decisions with such a vast product inventory and diverse customer base - that's a really unique use case that highlights both the potential and the limitations of AI in fast-paced retail environments.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for quick product substitutions in such a time-pressured environment, especially the challenges with voice recognition and foreign product names, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
