Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, feel free to begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a Creative Director for a physical product company that produces stationery, event decor items, and gifts. A typical project is usually a complete Design Collection that includes a number of items that are designed to coordinate. For event items, we create a collection that starts with an event invitation, and then add many coordinates such that the customer can create an entire event with matching items that we provide, such as signage, decor, favor tags and favors, wine bottle labels, thank you cards, menus, place cards, placemats, programs and more. So the project will start with inspiration gathering, idea generation, and then outlining the design ideas. Once we have the products designed, we focus on a marketing strategy and designs there, also.

AI: That sounds like such a comprehensive creative process - creating those cohesive collections that can transform an entire event experience. I can imagine there are so many touchpoints and details to coordinate across all those different items.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: First we use AI in the idea generation stage, helping us figure out use cases for items and helping us really empathize with our very specific customer. This helps us come up with events we wouldn't necessarily think of on our own, such as back to school events, school dances, proms, and even funerals. Idea generation is a huge area where we use AI. That's just the beginning.

AI: Tell me more about that idea generation process. How does AI help you empathize with your specific customer in ways you might not have thought of otherwise?

User: We input specific customer data and as much information as we know about our avatar, whom we've named "Caroline," and is a 50 year old married mother of two, with teenage children, living in the US in a suburban area, with a high disposable income. AI has been very helpful with generating ideas about what would matter to this woman, what she cares about, and what event take place in her life which we may be able to help with. Once we've identified a new event to design into, we search Pinterest for visual inspiration and start our design process. The next place we lean very heavily on AI is with mockup generation. We need very specific mockups, such as blank easels with specific backgrounds like weddings in certain color palettes, and Midjourney allows us to create the very specific mockups we need.

AI: That's fascinating how you've developed Caroline as such a specific persona to guide your AI interactions. When you're working with AI to understand what matters to Caroline or generating those specific mockups in Midjourney, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: Ultimately I always feel like we're driving the actual creative decision making, because as the Creative Director I already have a general idea of the direction I want to go and I'll only choose to use an idea or piece of content if I feel that it fits with the visuals or strategy I've already decided on. However especially with regard to Midjourney image generation, I am often very happily surprised with some of the visual representations the AI comes up with. It will be loosely following my prompts, but typically start without very strict parameters because I want to see what varying ideas it will come up with. Often it puts something together that I never would have thought about but actually works perfectly for my use case. In those situations, I am still making the creative decisions (to use or not use one of the AI's ideas), but those decisions are very heavily informed by what the AI produces.

AI: That's such an interesting dynamic - you're setting the creative boundaries and making the final calls, but the AI is expanding your palette of possibilities within those boundaries. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you moved through that creative process?

User: Sure, recently we created a line of gold foiled art prints and I needed some very specific mockups. They needed to be kitchens from very old world, high end mansions with a bright overall aesthetic that felt similar to Restoration Hardware, and I needed the walls to contain a number of frames in varying sizes that would still be dimensions that would work with our artwork. Adding "Restoration Hardware" to the prompt worked very well and the AI completely understood the vibe I was going for. It took a bit of time to get the frame sizes correct, as I was giving it quite a bit to have to figure out at once and there was a lot of detail that went into the images of the kitchens. Many of the frames were odd sizes for awhile, especially many square, but eventually I was able to get some really beautiful images with frames in the right sizes and they looked incredibly high and and realistic.

AI: That sounds like a really iterative process to get those frame dimensions just right. When you were going back and forth with the AI, refining those details like the frame sizes, how did that feel compared to how you might have approached creating those mockups before AI tools were available?

User: I loved the ability to decide on the fly that I wanted to see how the frames would look in gold rather than just black, and they actually looked way better than I would have thought. This is something that I could not have done prior. Typically I would have had to spend literally hours searching, scrolling through hundreds of mockup options, and NONE would be exactly what I wanted. Or I would have had to pay a photographer to shoot exactly what I wanted, but in this case that would have involved a significant amount of art direction, cost to rent a home for the day shoot, in addition to the photographer's fee which was about $2000 per day. Being able to create images that look nearly as incredible, and have so much control over every aspect, feels like a relief every time.

AI: That's such a dramatic shift - from hours of searching or thousands of dollars in photography costs to having that level of creative control at your fingertips. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI beyond just the mockup process?

User: We have been using AI for nearly all of our creative copy for ads, blog posts, social media posts, and more, which has been a huge time and money saver (not having to hire specific copywriters) and this means that our designers are able to handle more tasks that would have taken several people prior to the AI.

AI: So it sounds like AI has really streamlined your team's workflow and expanded what individual designers can handle. As you've integrated AI across these different areas - from copywriting to mockups to idea generation - what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I fully understand that my gain is another creative's loss. That product photographer that I used to have to pay $2000 per day is now not getting my business. That helps me massively, but I recognize that it has harmed her financially. The same goes for the copywriters which I no longer need to employ. So the tools have been wildly beneficial for me and mean increased output for less money, but those freelancers and contract creatives are no longer making and income from my business.

AI: That's a really honest and thoughtful acknowledgment of the broader impact. You're experiencing these significant benefits while being very aware of the ripple effects on other creative professionals.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Where do you think this trajectory leads for you and your team?

User: I see AI being able to handle more of the highly detailed, more customized work. For example, instead of working for an hour on prompts to get the AI to produce blank mockups for me so that I can later add in my products via Photoshop, I really look forward to being able to upload my product image and having AI fully create mockups that look totally realistic without me having to overlay my product images later. This is beginning to be a capability but I haven't see it work as well as I need yet. I also would like to see the speed with which we're able to create work increase as AI is able to produce mostly fleshed out designs such as for email designs or social media graphics. This would likely lead to a decrease in the size of the team where we're instead composed of fewer people, each much stronger in their understanding and skill with regard to AI "wrangling."

AI: That vision of AI handling the full mockup integration and your team evolving into AI "wranglers" is really compelling. It sounds like you see a future where the role shifts from doing the detailed technical work to being skilled at directing and refining AI outputs.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective on both the significant benefits you're experiencing and your awareness of the impact on other creative professionals - that kind of nuanced view is really valuable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, these are really the most important aspects of AI in my career.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI is transforming both the practical and strategic aspects of creative work - from idea generation with Caroline to the evolution toward AI "wrangling" - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your thoughtful and candid responses today. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
