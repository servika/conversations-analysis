Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's begin!

AI:

User: I have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I run several social media accounts for a local company. I write posts, advertisements, and blurbs daily. I use AI to double-check my grammar and to ensure what I am writing is clear. Sometimes, I will put in a couple of sentences and ask it to change the tone to be more persuasive, but I haven't had a lot of luck with that part being successful.

AI: That's really interesting that you've found AI helpful for grammar and clarity checking, but less successful with tone adjustments. 

Can you tell me more about what happens when you ask AI to make your writing more persuasive? What specifically doesn't work about those results?

User: When I ask for something to be written persuasively it uses an over abundance of adjectives. It also sounds very canned and not personal. I ask AI to rephrase this advertising blurb to sound more persuasive: "Ready for the big day? I have wedding packages for every budget. I will work with you to make sure we capture your big day. Contact me!"

AI: That's a great concrete example. So when you get those results with too many adjectives and that canned sound, what do you typically do next? Do you try to work with AI to refine it, or do you go back to handling the persuasive writing yourself?

User: And it gave me back the following: "Ready to begin forever? My wedding photography packages are flexible so you can focus on the big day while I preserve the magic. I'll work along side you to ensure your once-in-a-lifetime memories are beautifully captured. Message me today!"    I felt like this sounded very artificial. It sounds like a sales pitch and there is no nuance to it. It did several iterations of this same bad writing. I would ask for it to be persuasive but not too flowery, and then it gave me a Spartan blurb. I ended up using my original sentence because it wasn't too verbose. The reason why I was looking at alternatives to begin with is that I use this type of phrasing often and I wanted to switch it up.

AI: That's really helpful to understand your process. So it sounds like you were caught between AI's overly flowery version and then its overly sparse version when you tried to correct it, and your original actually hit the right middle ground.

When you encounter these kinds of limitations with AI - like not being able to get that nuanced persuasive tone you're looking for - how does that affect your approach to using it for other writing tasks?

User: I don't use it for writing because I know it will sound artificial. I once asked it to write a couple of paragraphs discussing the value of investing in professional photography to capture important moments. And it kept using this type of phrasing: "that's not XYZ, that's ABC" or "it's more than ABC, it's XYZ" or "they don't just XYZ, they do ABC." Another thing I notice is when it was discussing photography, it is obsessed with discussing time. For example, it said pictures "hold on to time" and "value lies in their permanence" and "frozen in time." Plus, there is the overuse of adjectives as in "fleeting expressions" or "quiet in between moments" or "restrained pride." It's getting much easier to spot AI writing and these are the tell-tale clues.

AI: You've really developed a keen eye for spotting AI writing patterns. Those repetitive structures and the obsession with certain themes like time in photography writing are fascinating observations.

Given that you've identified these limitations with AI-generated writing, I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to handle the writing so there is an element of authenticity. I do wish AI could help me with marketing strategies. I have asked about an idea of mine and how I could implement it, and it gave me terrible advice. So I rephrased and asked did it think this advertising idea I have would lead to greater reach on social media? And it said yes, and began rattling off statistics about various social media sites. I looked up those statistics and they were not true. I find when I ask for subjective guidance, I get praise and not constructive criticism. When I specifically ask, please give me constructive criticism, it will give a critique that makes no sense. I feel like when I work with AI it's like a five-year-old saying she wants to make a cake and she puts all of her favorite foods in a bowl and mixes them up and bakes it. Then when I ask how to make a plain chocolate cake or advice on why my cake tasted off AI will tell me to add jellybeans and chocolate pudding.

AI: That's such a vivid analogy - the five-year-old mixing favorite foods together! It really captures that sense of AI missing the mark on nuanced judgment calls.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you've tried collaborating with it on tasks like refining tone, but given these experiences, are you more likely to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently, or do you find yourself trying to work through problems with it step by step?

User: I will delegate very simple objective tasks, such as asking it to review my writing for grammar errors and clarity. Also, sometimes I can't think of a word but I know the meaning I am trying to convey so I will ask AI for a list of words that means xyz.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've found that sweet spot for AI where it can be genuinely helpful with those more mechanical, objective tasks.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about AI usage with others at your company, or is it something you've mostly figured out on your own?

User: I work with two other people, and one is the photographer who does nothing with AI, and the other is the manager who also does not use AI. I know that other Social Media managers have lost their jobs because companies are using AI because it's cheaper. When I go on Reddit and read subreddits of freelance writers, this is talked about very frequently.

AI: That's a really important perspective - being aware of that broader impact on your field while still trying to find useful ways to work with AI yourself.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I get frustrated when it cannot grasp the nuance of language and everything it presents sounds insincere. I get frustrated when I spend more time telling AI, "make it sound less flowery" or "the tone should be less formal" and it still misses the mark. My style of writing in advertisement is conversational. I want our client base to feel like I am talking to them.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - spending more time trying to guide AI toward your conversational style than it would take to just write it yourself in the first place.

On the flip side, have there been times when using AI made you feel particularly satisfied? Maybe with those grammar checks or word searches you mentioned, or any other situations?

User: That's really it. When I have objective requests such as grammar checks and word searches I do feel satisfied. I can't think of any other situations.

AI: That's really clear - you've found AI works well for those concrete, objective tasks but struggles with the more nuanced parts of your work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given what you've mentioned about other social media managers losing jobs?

User: The reason why I like to write in a conversational manner is to differentiate our ads from AI generated ads. It sounds more authentic. I want the customers to feel like I am talking to them, not talking at them. Sure, there is going to be a large pruning of writers in the beginning, but soon it will become more evident to the consumer when something is written by AI or not. It's like comparing mass-produced art with art painted by an artist. There is a difference and humans recognize and appreciate the authenticity.

AI: That's a thoughtful strategy - using authenticity as a differentiator. The mass-produced art versus artist comparison really captures that distinction you're drawing.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue using it primarily for those objective tasks like grammar and word searches, or do you see that changing?

User: I don't see it changing honestly. Unless AI suddenly has the ability to understand the human experience and language nuances, I don't see myself using it for subjective or creative tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using authenticity as a differentiator and that vivid analogy about the five-year-old making cake - it really captured your experience with AI's limitations on nuanced tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think that's all I have to say. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI for objective tasks while maintaining human authenticity for creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
