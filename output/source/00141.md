Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, no questions yet!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI in a few different ways right now. I like to use it to draft replies to emails which I feel like saves me a ton of time (especially tricky emails that may need to be handled in a sensitive manner - i.e. informing someone of a delay). I also use it for data analysis to extract or summarize lengthy reports, spreadsheets, etc. Lastly, I use it for some administrative tasks like planning, cleaning up meeting minutes, etc.

AI: That's a great range of uses. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes! Some tasks I just truly enjoy doing myself - like creative tasks. If it's something that I'm personally passionate about then I do it myself. If it's mundane then I might get AI to help me. Also, some detailed things like financial reports I do myself due to the concern of AI making errors.

AI: That's really interesting - the distinction between what you're passionate about versus what feels mundane, and also that trust factor with detailed financial work. 

When you do use AI for those tasks you mentioned earlier - like drafting emails or analyzing reports - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually collaborate with it throughout the task. So, I might give it a prompt containing an email and general context of how I need to reply then let it draft a response. Once it gives a response, I might add additional points that I forgot initially. I'll work with the AI until we've created the final product that I need. I like to use AI to improve efficiency and to lighten my mental load, but I also like to still feel in control of my work.

AI: That collaborative approach really comes through - it sounds like you've found a way to use AI as a partner while maintaining that sense of control over your work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues and workplace haven't had much of an influence on how I use AI. I've adapted it on my own to suit my needs independently. My workplace can be fast paced at times based on deadlines, so that definitely encourages me to use AI to improve my efficiency where I can.

AI: It sounds like you've been pretty self-directed in figuring out what works for you, with that fast-paced environment creating a natural incentive to find efficiencies.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was completely overwhelmed with work to catch up on coming back from vacation. Not only did I need to handle client issues, but there were also lots of updated internal reports and documents that needed to be reviewed and understood. I used AI to summarize some of those reports so I could save myself the time of reading them line by line. Overall, it saved me hours of reading and let me get to more important work.

AI: That sounds like such a relief in what could have been a really stressful situation. The time savings you described - going from hours of reading to being able to focus on more important work - that's significant.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't really have this concern or consider this too much. AI can help with my job, but likely would not be able to take over my job. I keep my skills and knowledge up to date, but I never really worry about AI interfering down the road.

AI: That's a confident perspective - it sounds like you see AI as enhancing what you do rather than threatening it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I've tailored how I like to use AI to suit my needs for now. One way it could potentially evolve is if accuracy became less of a concern then it could maybe become more helpful with detailed/financial related tasks in the future.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - accuracy improvements could really open up new areas where you'd feel comfortable using AI.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've maintained that collaborative approach while staying in control, and how you've been so intentional about where you do and don't use AI based on your own interests and trust levels.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we've covered everything from my side. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between efficiency and control, and how you've thoughtfully carved out areas where you prefer to stay hands-on, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
