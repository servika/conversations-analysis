Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure thing. It's worth noting from the start that our company has a current senior management team which is quite hesitant to adopt AI in the workplace. The features I currently use and the features I would like to use are different. 

As you have asked about my typical workday, at present, I will focus on that

I work as a financial analyst. 95% of my work is with numbers; budgets, QBRs, even transactional accounting ledger work. 5% of my work is drawing up reports to explain performance vs budget etc.

I currently use AI to help me draft these reports. I was in a bit of a rut with regards to presentations, often reusing the same slides and information month after month. AI has helped me freshen things up on the creative side which has helped with both my interest in doing the work, and user engagement with the data I have been reporting.

I also use AI to verify some findings if I am reviewing tenders, contracts, alterations etc. My workplace absolutely requires me to do the ground work and findings first, but I use AI to verify what I have found and suggest changes.

AI: That's really helpful context about the management hesitation. I'm curious about that verification process you mentioned with tenders and contracts.

When you say you use AI to verify your findings, can you walk me through what that looks like? How do you actually interact with the AI during that process?

User: Of course. 
The tender documents I am reviewing are often 20-50 pages long and it's easy to miss something important. We have our company templates and key figures we extract to process tender information, and this part hasn't changed. I then upload the document, with certain redactions, to an AI platform and ask a series of questions ranging from "Can you summarise section x" or "Can you confirm that my findings of x, y & z are accurate as per this report?". I also like to ask AI if there are any clear contradictions in the file, such as the price of product x is listed as £200 in section 4 but later listed as £250 in section 18.
With contracts, they are an evolving document with alterations that can sometimes span years. Again I ask it to validate my findings and ensure there are no clear contradictions such as "Amendment 3.14 stated a service ceased to be provided on 31st Dec 2021" but later states "Amendment 4.82 notes the same service ceased 30th Jan 2022"

AI: That sounds like a really methodical approach. I'm interested in how you think about that division of labor between you and the AI.

You mentioned your workplace requires you to do the groundwork first before using AI for verification. Even setting aside workplace requirements, are there parts of that tender and contract review process that you prefer to handle yourself? What makes you want to keep certain aspects under your own control?

User: Well from an audit point of view it's critical that I am 100% certain that the information I am reporting is valid and true. That's really what keeps the company back from implementing further AI use across the business - potential legal repercussions.

Personally, I would be happy to let a trustworthy AI model do more of the work. The quality is often high level and reliable. The work that goes into preparing a tender or contract alteration doesn't just stop with this process though. All of the information that is stored in my head bleeds through to the daily life of the business. Those meetings that span various departments, watercooler brainstorm moments, client interactions where I am expected to look someone in the eye with confidence and state "Yes, I calculated x and this is the result". Many business interactions are still a people first approach, even in the technologically advancing world (not even solely referring to AI here) and so having that genuine interaction means a lot

AI: That's a fascinating point about the people-first nature of business interactions. You mentioned those moments where you need to look someone in the eye and state with confidence that you calculated something.

Tell me more about that. How does having done the work yourself versus having AI assist change how you feel in those moments? Does it affect your confidence differently?

User: It can, yes. At the moment I do the groundwork as we discussed. Then I use AI to verify, which is unbelievably helpful and reassuring that my findings were correct. This gives me the highest confidence when I am entering presentations, negotiations or contract reviews. People have a very keen sense of when another person is being genuine and if they know their numbers. I feel that using AI to do all of the work would lead to a stale presentation and quite frankly if I were to be questioned on some of the results in a high stakes client meeting, I would likely stumble over my words or worse, fail to come up with a valid reason because it wasn't myself that validated the facts. Small things like this can lead to a lost contract or lower spending clients

AI: That insight about authenticity in high-stakes situations is really valuable. It sounds like there's something important about that personal validation process for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Certainly. 
Without going into too much detail, we had a retention meeting with our second biggest client just 5 months ago. A 6 year relationship had been built however things were going south in terms of quality and KPI successes. Partially due to a change in personnel and partially due to the rising costs surrounding all areas of business over the past number of years. Reviewing the contract and performance itself was simple enough, I worked on it monthly of course, so the numbers and trends were ingrained in my mind. 
However, I used AI ahead of the meeting to do some research on wider industry trends. Rising costs of certain goods, broken down into time periods that could be used to justify our current pricing models and show that we had the edge over the market. This gave us renewed confidence that our figures were accurate and the meeting went well when we had this evidence to support our position.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you build a stronger case with industry context. It sounds like that broader research capability was really valuable for that high-stakes meeting.

I'm curious about how your workplace culture affects your AI use. You mentioned earlier that senior management is hesitant about AI adoption. How does that influence the way you actually use these tools day-to-day?

User: Yes, for sure it does.
At the moment I am restricted to using AI the way the company allows. I am not tech savvy enough to know if they can ever find out if I overuse AI or use it outside of their guidelines, so tend not to even try.
We do have 3 senior management members due for retirement in the coming 12-18 months. There is a younger set of individuals, myself included, who are up for promotion and if the dynamic were to shift with these new appointments, it could see AI adopted more freely across the business.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic – waiting for that generational shift in leadership. 

When you think about that potential future where AI might be adopted more freely, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What would you want to do differently if those restrictions weren't in place?

User: Well, sweeping changes wouldn't be implemented overnight, it could be a more steady rollout to test confidence. I would love to start with tasking AI with the processing of repetitive, daily tasks that just take time, not brainpower. This would free up user time, including my own, to focus more attention on the key decisions of the role. It would also serve as a more serious trial of AI in the workplace which could help to alleviate concerns of other stakeholders, the audit team and clients.

AI: That makes a lot of sense – starting with those repetitive tasks as a testing ground. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you think about your career development?

User: The workplace is ever evolving and even without AI, skills and job roles change over time regardless. I always think the key decisions on business strategy, decision making and client critical interactions will be upheld by the human mind. AI will be a support tool, a very strong and useful tool of course, but I don't see it ever taking away enough of my own job role/career trajectory for it to be a real issue. The absolute truth is that I think people are overworked in their current work environment and so, if AI can help to shed some workload and free up mental capacity, that can only be a good thing. I do think that AI learning ie. how to interact with models, how to use them optimally, will be of critical importance, so that is an area that I am currently focusing on.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on AI as a workload-balancing tool rather than a replacement. I appreciate how you're thinking about developing those AI interaction skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your story?

User: No, I think we've covered a lot and got to the crux of my situation. AI inn my workplace is restricted at the present though I would like to see its use increased over time. Learning how to interact with models will be key and an area for continued training. The backbone of human decision making and interactions will remain, though AI should be used as a genuine support system.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. You've provided some really thoughtful insights about your work as a financial analyst and how you're navigating AI adoption in a cautious workplace environment.

I particularly appreciated your perspective on the importance of doing the groundwork yourself to maintain authenticity in client interactions, and how you see AI as a verification tool that actually boosts your confidence rather than replacing your expertise. Your point about AI helping with workload balance rather than job replacement was also valuable.

Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. Thanks again for taking the time to speak with me today!
