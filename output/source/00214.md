Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, I'm happy to start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I tend to use it for areas where I feel a little unsure, uninspired or if there are boring tasks that I know could be sped up with the help of AI. Usually this is helping to write and format CV's, checking documents including contracts, summarising contracts I've received from outside companies and alerting me to any key clauses, and writing emails or coming up with things to say when I am negotiating or dealing with a tough situation. I can get a bit nervous when faced with confrontation and sometimes my job relies on me arguing a point so I would use AI in this situation to give some key talking points and reduce the stress I feel. Also, as a sole trader running a business it's often a bit lonely so I sometimes will use AI to bounce my ideas off for future business plans or just to chat things through to affirm my point. Also, where I often have to look through scripts and look at film or theatre data, I use AI to research.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves multiple roles for you, from the practical administrative tasks to almost being a thinking partner when you're working alone.

Tell me more about using AI when you're feeling nervous about confrontation or need to argue a point. What does that process look like for you?

User: Without AI I will tend to get myself quite worked up, particularly if I know I need to call someone on the phone. I use the AI models to discuss the issue and come up with some key points that I can refer to when on the call, and this also helps me feel less stressed because I know what points I am trying to put across. I sometimes will also do a fake script to practice, and will also do this based around email exchanges also. 

One example of this was recently one of my clients had filmed on a commercial and was supposed to only be a walk on actor and therefore would only be due a day rate fee. When the commercial came out on TV they were featured more than most of the other cast being paid as 'featured' roles with a significant buyout fee, and the other walk on actors were not even seen at all. I used AI to help me construct the argument that I was making to the production company, including sections of the contract and union guidelines to try and get it agreed that he would also be paid the correct buyout fee. When they came back and said no, I used AI to help me write the emails back and forth, discussed the situation with AI to get a second opinion and also got some of my frustration out by talking it through. Eventually the production company agreed to pay.

AI: That's a fascinating example - it sounds like AI helped you not just with the technical aspects of building your argument, but also with the emotional side of managing that kind of negotiation.

When you say you got some of your frustration out by talking it through with AI, how did that compare to what you might have done before AI was available? Did you have other ways of working through those feelings or preparing for difficult conversations?

User: Before AI was available, I'll be honest, I used to just stew in the frustration and it was making me hate my job and feel very alone not having someone else supporting me when I knew I was in the right. I used to think about quitting my own business often and cried a lot more than I do now.

AI: That sounds like a really significant change in your work experience. It's clear that AI has provided something that was missing for you - that support and validation when dealing with difficult situations.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: With my job, I like getting to see the upcoming screen and stage productions on the jobs boards and submit my clients. I don't think this is something that AI could do because it requires physically knowing the person you are representing and their quirks, plus if AI could do that aspect I think that my job would be made entirely redundant.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like the personal knowledge and relationship building aspects are core to what you do and what makes your role valuable.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends. I think it's probably about 30% delegation for the tasks that I need something done quickly that I know would take me ages such as writing CV's, editing documents, summarising documents. More often is a collab, where I'm trying to either work out a plan, research something specific for a film or theatre piece, or brainstorm with the model for business plans/how I could improve things, or working together to create something such as a short piece of script to get a client to self-tape so I can assess their acting.

AI: That's a really helpful breakdown. It sounds like the collaborative approach is more common for you, especially when creativity or strategic thinking is involved.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? As a sole trader, I'm curious if you interact with others in your field and how they view AI use.

User: Because I work in the entertainment industry there is a big movement against the use of AI, particularly because it can be used so creatively. Obviously there was the writers strike because colleagues were worried about AI writing film and tv scripts and the writers no longer being needed. 

My voiceover actors are getting very low fee offers from shady companies to send clips of their voice for AI models to use in perp, which in turn would put them out of earning for future voiceover work, particularly as there would be no limit on where the clients voice could be used, and thus creates an issue of competing brands who may not use AI also not employing them so they lose out doubly.

For me, and other talent reps in the entertainment industry, we try to get our clients to steer clear of contracts where there are clauses that the footage or voice can be used for AI. 

Whilst I do like using AI to make my life easier, and I know some other businesses owners in the industry are too, I understand the worry and am cautious about what information I add to the system and worry where this may lead and how the already struggling industry is under a lot of strain from the AI advancement.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're navigating this tension between finding AI personally helpful while being protective of your clients' interests in an industry that's genuinely concerned about AI's impact.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would say the time I felt most satisfied was the situation discussed with the commercial buyout issue because I found confidence in the information and key notes that we came up with together. 

I think as models have advanced I'm feeling less issues of frustration but sometimes the models just throw up issues or won't answer questions around some topics.  Also, sometimes I find that they won't quite do what I ask, or things get jumbled so I have to still go in and perhaps edit a document. Mostly, it's on voice input that I struggle with issues of it misunderstanding or thinking I'm using a different language.

AI: The confidence boost you got from that commercial situation really stands out - it sounds like having AI as a collaborator gave you the support you needed to advocate effectively for your client.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm always trying to maintain my skills in all areas because I don't think we are quite at the point of AI adoption in business yet and I often think about moving on from my current job so feel I need to keep my skills fresh.

AI: That makes sense - staying adaptable and keeping your skills current, especially when considering future career moves.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I like to think of AI as a collaborator so in the future as my business needs change and it either grows or I move on it will adapt with my needs. 
I can see AI being a good tool to increase efficiency in all areas so I will continue to use it for laborious admin tasks and also for brainstorming.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you manage both the practical and emotional challenges of running a solo business, while still being mindful of the broader concerns in your industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all I think.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a practical tool and an emotional support system, especially while navigating the complex concerns in the entertainment industry, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you spoke about the impact AI has had on your work life and wellbeing. Take care!
