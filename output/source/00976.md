Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, let's go :)

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Every day I need to field questions relating to contracts with third-party suppliers, and special nuances within the contract and their SLAs. As I have a lot of questions to deal with and a lot of contracts in the database, I generally use AI to scan and pick out key points from the contracts, or to check if my understanding of an SLA and the ramifications of them not being met are correct. I also use AI for brainstorming on reports, about the best way to present facts and figures, as well as using AI as a shortcut for formulae, VLookups etc in excel

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI across several different areas - from contract analysis to report writing to Excel work.

When you're working with contracts and SLAs, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you upload the contract and ask specific questions, or is there a particular way you approach getting AI to help you scan for those key points?

User: Yes, I'll give the AI an overview of the question that is being asked, and then upload the contract for it to view. The contract is always in a PDF format, sometimes with annotations but most often it can be considered 'clean,' with only e-signatures attached at the end of the contracts. I generally know where in a contract most points will be, for example with the SLAs, they'll be in a compliance section, but there can also be more nuanced questions regarding breaches of terms and conditions, as well as whether risks have been considered. So, I'll have a chat, essentially, with the AI about what the points included in the contract mean, and test its thinking about consequences.

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially having a dialogue with AI to test your own understanding and explore the implications. 

When you say you "test its thinking about consequences," can you give me an example of what that conversation might sound like? What does that back-and-forth process look like when you're working through something like a potential breach or risk scenario?

User: A recent example would be in situations where there is a data sharing agreement in place with a third-party supplier, but they have undergone a change of ownership. The new ownership had not been subjected to the standard procurement and governance checks that we would have done if we were onboarding a new supplier and product, and I wanted to know whether if we objected to the new ownership of the supplier, whether we could terminate the data sharing agreement or force it to be re-negotiated. The agreement was quite longstanding, as is the relationship with the entity that was taken over (but still effectively in existence), and as I wasn't the one who originally wrote the contract, I wanted to explore the Change of Control clauses. Although I deal with contracts and try to answer questions from stakeholders about them, I am not actually a lawyer, so 'legal speak' is strange and baffling to me, and I'm quite a literal person. So the back and forth is about testing nuance, as well as finding out the appropriate vocabulary I need to use with then providing an answer to Risk, Compliance and Legal departments on the contract.

AI: That's a really compelling example - you're navigating complex legal language while needing to provide clear guidance to multiple departments, and you're doing this without formal legal training.

When you're having those conversations with AI to test nuance and find the right vocabulary, how do you know when you can trust the AI's interpretation? What gives you confidence that you're understanding the contract correctly before you take that information to Risk, Compliance, and Legal?

User: I've got some experience with contracts now, and while I wouldn't be confident in writing one from scratch myself, I can typically gauge from an AI response whether it is on the right track. Basically, I'll have my own thoughts about what a clause can mean, if the AI agrees with me then we're probably both right; if there is deeper nuance, or conflicting statements, then at least I know the advice I give to the other departments has to include caveats about interpretation (most likely negotiation and compromise, leading to common ground with a supplier). does that help?

AI: That absolutely helps - you're using your accumulated experience as a check against AI responses, and when there's disagreement or complexity, you're transparent about the uncertainty rather than presenting definitive answers.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your contract work, reporting, or Excel analysis that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I'm a visual person, and with reports, and in particular, tables and spreadsheets in excel, I like things to look a certain way. The aesthetics are there to help with the impact of the information in my view, as I don't want to have to spend time explaining a report to the person who has asked for it, when they should really be analysing the report themselves to understand it. So, for me, the visual aesthetic is important because it helps to make the report 'idiot-proof' (although I don't mean that I consider other people idiots). That being said, these days I don't have the time to perform multiple google searches in the hope that the search engine finds a webpage with the keywords of what I want to achieve; if I can loosely explain it to an AI, the AI then figures out what I want or we collaborate to get it there. 
Before using AI, when I had questions about excel formulae, and questions like 'how do I do X/Y/Z' I would have spent a lot of time on search engines and forums trying to find the right fit, and then getting frustrated when inevitably, there was either an error in the recommended script or if my execution had mistakes. Now, although I do like to learn and understand, I can just ask the AI to do it, and ask for a summary to coincide with the the output so at least I can see what components are necessary to get us there for when I need it again.

AI: That's really insightful - you've kept control over the visual design because that's where your expertise around impact and clarity matters most, but you've shifted the time-consuming research and troubleshooting to AI.

When you're working with AI on those Excel formulas or technical solutions, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it step-by-step through a problem, or do you tend to give it a complete task description and let it handle it independently?

User: Step by step. If it was a real person I was dealing with, I imagine they'd get frustrated and reply during steps 2, 3, 4 etc: 'why didn't you just ask for that in Step X already!?' but I like to develop my thoughts and build and build upon ideas. As I mentioned earlier, I'm very visual so I tend to know what I want to produce from my mind's eye (although I'm flexible if something isn't working) but I don't have time to write granular level points that spell out everything in one go and hope the AI can 'one-shot' it, only for me to have to figure out what part of my prompt wasn't understood. do you know what I mean?

AI: I absolutely know what you mean - you're building the solution iteratively because it's more efficient than trying to perfect a complex prompt upfront, even if it means more back-and-forth.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or approaches around you that have shaped how you integrate these tools?

User: Yes, I love to find out how other people deal with AI. If I sit with someone, I really love finding out how their character and personality carries through with how they deal with the AI, and especially if how you see a person, for example, as bubbly and a bit scatterbrained, but yet whey they interact with AI, their bubbly personality remains in their language but the inputs they give the AI are far more refined than their everyday speech. I find it fascinating. I treat people with respect, and I think that is how you should deal with an AI, because then you are being true to yourself, kind of like the public versus private persona needs to remain consistent I guess. does that answer your question?

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about how people's personalities show up in their AI interactions, and your point about consistency between public and private personas is intriguing.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I joined this company and saw that they were using a premium AI subscription, I was amazed at the capabilities and quality of output it had compared to the lite versions I'd experienced in a previous company. During my first couple of weeks I was asked to produce a report, and I was unfamiliar with the full terms of the contract of the SaaS provider, so I used the AI for brainstorming and formatting, and checking the elements of the contract I needed to get familiar with. I felt proud with the quality of the report I produced: visually it was professional and the content was like I'd been doing contract management for years. I don't think I had any frustrating moments in that exercise, as I was just impressed with the AI; it was like having a teammate that didn't mind your poor explanations or briefs, and it just wanted to help.

AI: That sounds like such a positive early experience - feeling supported rather than judged, and being able to produce work that met your standards right away.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI will be a great time saver and automation is a crucial step in efficiencies, so if my job was solely around creating the same reports day in day out, well you can do this with even basic programs so I'd be worried, but for my role, I manage relationships, so the intention, message, and recommendations from the reports and how they are perceived by stakeholders and the follow up questions they have about suppliers that need to have a balance of diplomacy and judgement means that I'll be in a job for a long time to come. Does that fit what you're asking?

AI: That fits perfectly - you're focusing on the relationship management and nuanced judgment aspects that require your human insight.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope so. I think multi-platform integration and standardisation is going to be a next step. For example, in a large organisation, different systems are used for different functions, like invoice payments, management information, database records, archives, back-end support, front-end support etc, and going between each system is manual and often independent of each other (unless there is already an API of course). So, I would love for AI to almost be like a passenger along the 'journeys' I go through each day, with an omniscient view of what I'm doing and able to have my back through breadcrumbs and suggestions, and even pre-empt what I might need to do next.

AI: That vision of AI as an omniscient companion that can connect across all your different systems and anticipate your needs is really compelling.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how people's personalities carry through in their AI interactions, and your vision of AI as a supportive teammate rather than a replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for contract analysis, the importance of iterative collaboration, and especially your observations about how people's personalities show up in their AI interactions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've described your approach to working with AI - from maintaining control over the visual aspects that matter most to you, to treating AI with the same respect you'd show a human colleague. These kinds of authentic perspectives are exactly what help us understand how these tools are really being integrated into people's work lives.

Thanks again for participating!
