Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, let's begin

AI: Great! Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI tools to help me with formatting, guiding me through unfamiliar tasks, looking up Excel formulas for data processing, and composing messages for emails and Teams messaging

AI: That's a nice range of uses. I'm curious to dig deeper into one of those areas you mentioned - when you say AI guides you through unfamiliar tasks, what does that actually look like? Can you walk me through a recent example?

User: I am relatively new to corporate data management and business analysis. I use Microsoft tools for work, and I have found AI is really helpful in learning how to use these tools better. For example, I am generally pretty good with Excel, but asked AI for the formula formatting for pulling data from one sheet to another within an Excel document that had multiple tabs of data that needed combining.

AI: That's really helpful context. So you're using AI as a kind of learning companion while you're getting up to speed in your role. 

When you were working on that Excel formula problem, how did the interaction actually unfold? Did you go back and forth with the AI, or did it give you what you needed right away?

User: It gave me what I needed right away. And yes, in this area it is a learning tool. I generally will ask the AI models these things with generic naming and such so I can make the specific changes for myself. For example referring to "SheetA" instead of giving the real name. That way it still feels like my work, I am learning, and there is a layer of protection for any company data security issues.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - creating that generic layer for both learning and security purposes. It sounds like you've developed a specific way of working with AI that keeps you in control of the learning process.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I am not even sure. I use AI a lot. I still make my own graphics, even though there are AI tools out there for it, because I enjoy making pretty pictures. For most writing tasks I will either get AI to write an initial draft I edit, or to tweak something I have already written.

AI: It sounds like enjoyment plays a role in what you choose to keep for yourself - you mentioned you enjoy making graphics. 

When you're working on those writing tasks where you either start with an AI draft or have AI tweak your work, how do you typically approach that? Do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI, or is it more of a one-shot thing where you take what it gives you and move on?

User: It depends on the task, and often on how well the AI handles the request. If I have had to make 3 or 4 corrections, I will just take what it gave me and finish it myself because I assume the AI doesnt understand, is incapable, or maybe I am just not explaining myself well enough.

AI: That's interesting - you have this kind of threshold where if it's not working after a few tries, you shift gears and take over. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it more something you've figured out on your own?

User: We talk about it openly. My role is to generally keep the company's internal web use up-to-date and therefore I am expected to know and communicate what the right level of use is per use-case. I am the unofficial lead in this area, so I am doing a lot of it by figuring it out on my own.

AI: So you're not just a user - you're actually helping shape AI policy and practices for your company. That's a unique position to be in.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Oh I just love automations. I do a lot with Power Automations within the Microsoft bubble and I use the copilot feature all the time to adjust the settings to make everything work right, since it can be finicky. My largest frustration with AI right now is juggling understanding of privacy concerns and all the different models. I get asked if particular tools are okay for particular uses and it is constantly changing. Every ask is a small research project.

AI: That automation satisfaction really comes through - it sounds like you get a real kick out of making those systems work smoothly with AI's help.

And I can imagine that research burden around different tools and privacy considerations must be exhausting, especially when you're the go-to person for those decisions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I read an article a while back comparing AI and tech jobs to how Excel impacted bookkeepers and accountants. It did not kill the profession, it made them able to do more and be more effective. It is up to the employers to manage this right, but I think it can lead to more productivity and reduced worker stress, since AI can help get through a lot of frustrating tasks. However, you still need to be able to understand what AI is doing so you can identify problems as they arise. Much like an accountant needs to understand how the Excel formulas work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the Excel analogy is particularly apt given your role. It sounds like you see AI as fundamentally changing how work gets done rather than replacing the need for human understanding.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Especially considering your unique position of helping guide AI use across your company?

User: Well, I am hoping they bring me on as a full time employee because it is growing in impact at such a rate!

AI: Ha! That's definitely a good sign when your expertise becomes that essential to the organization.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI is like Excel for accountants - that it enhances capability rather than replaces the need for understanding.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a learning tool, developing those thoughtful privacy practices, and especially your role in helping shape AI policy for your company will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with that full-time position - it sounds like you're exactly the kind of person organizations need to navigate this AI transition thoughtfully!
