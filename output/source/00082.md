Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The latest research project that I've worked on is the distribution of mitragynine (MTRG for here on out) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MTRG from here on out) in post mortem kratom deaths. I work at a medical examiner's office in the toxicology department. We are seeing a rise in high doses of kratom, in some cases the sole cause of death. We wanted to see the concentration of MTRG and 7-OH-MTRG in femoral, heart, subclavian, and chest blood in relation to dosage. We procured multiple samples from the morgue as the pathologists preformed autopsies. We collected data over the course of a year and then crunched the data.

AI: That's fascinating research with important public health implications. Tell me more about what that data crunching process looked like - how did you go from having all those blood samples and concentration measurements to your final analysis?

User: We use liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) to quantitate the samples. We used cold acetonitrile to crash the proteins out of the blood, as well as internal standard. We used a calibration curve to give us a value of the MTRG and 7-OH-MTRG. We then used a spread sheet to organize blood types, concentrations, and drug effects. Once we completed the year long study, we analyzed the distribution pasterns.

AI: That sounds like a very methodical process. When you got to that final stage of analyzing the distribution patterns in your spreadsheet data - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We have touched on using AI tools, however, it was not extensive. I attempted to have our tools pull out different patterns that we could not analyze by visual examination.

AI: Tell me more about that - what specific patterns were you hoping the AI might identify that weren't visible through your visual examination?

User: Anything really. The tool did show us that there was a relationship between distribution of MTRG/7-OH-MTRG, time between death and usage, and concentration. For example, once the drug was in the system for more than 30 minutes prior to death, there was a 10:1 ratio between MTRG:7-OH-MTRG. Furthermore, there was a ratio of distribution between femoral blood and subclavian/heart/chest that was around 2:1 ratio. This helps us understand how long ago a drug was taken, what the dosage was, and what the effects are.

AI: That's really compelling - those ratios sound like they could be quite valuable for forensic analysis. For this pattern recognition task, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of visual examination and manual analysis.

User: I am tasked with implementation of AI, python scripts, and VBA equations. We were given a 2 week license to an AI subscription, so I was trying out the tool in every capacity I was able to. We did also use analysts to blindly pattern match. We found that some analysts could detect the femoral to other blood ratio, while others were able to find the 10:1 ratio in some instances. However, the tool was the only method we were able to relate both AND the time of death dosage difference.

AI: That's really interesting that the AI was able to find relationships that even your experienced analysts couldn't consistently identify. We're about one-third of the way through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like the initial sample processing with LC/MS or setting up your calibration curves - what's kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: Those are both historically studied and known methods. While someone with little LC experience could use the software, everyone in the lab performs these type of duties and extractions on a daily basis.

AI: That makes sense - you rely on established, validated methods for those core analytical processes. When you did use AI for that pattern recognition work, how did you verify or validate what it produced - especially since it was finding relationships that your analysts couldn't consistently detect?

User: Once it was brought to the forefront, we could easily see the patterns. Almost like muddy water becoming clear, in a sense. Now that we have established the ratios, we have incorporated them in our SOPs.

AI: That's a great analogy - the AI helping to clarify what was already there but hard to see. We're nearing the end of our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love to AI assistance in terms of project assignment. Some assays are longer and more involved than others. This causes man hour issues where some analysts will work 30 man hours worth of bench work, while others work 10. This disparity is VERY difficult to manage while the assay list is so dynamic.

AI: That's a really practical need - workload distribution and resource management across your lab. It sounds like the complexity and variability of different assays makes it challenging to balance fairly.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI for pattern detection in forensic toxicology and the potential for workflow optimization were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, I think we've hit all the major points, effectively.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI revealed those critical time-based ratios that are now part of your standard operating procedures really help us understand how AI can uncover patterns that skilled analysts might miss, even in highly specialized forensic work. The practical challenges you mentioned around workload management also highlight how AI applications extend beyond just data analysis into operational aspects of research.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! It was really enlightening to hear about your work in forensic toxicology and how you're exploring AI applications in such a critical field. Take care!
