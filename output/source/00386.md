Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that all sounds good. I don't have any questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As an artist who uses photoshop (and occasionally illustrator) quite a bit, there are times where it isn't even used intentionally for a given task. Nowadays AI has been made a part of tools that I would use anyway. Intentionally, though, it's often good for taking assets or images and resizing them- AI can do a decent job at making photos a workable resolution.

AI: That's really interesting - the distinction between intentional and unintentional AI use. It sounds like AI has become embedded in tools you were already using.

When you talk about resizing images, can you walk me through what that process looks like? What makes AI particularly helpful for that specific task?

User: So because a lot of things I work on get printed, sometimes to quite large sizes, typically unless the original source image for an asset I'm using is already at an exceptional resolution (or is a vector or something) I'm going to need it at a bigger size to fit the project canvas size I'm working on. In order to avoid a really pixelated mess I have to hope I can find an appropriately sized image. AI can do a good job of bringing photos to the necessary resolution, so I don't have to pivot or work with only images that are large enough. It can't work miracles, but for images that are almost large enough, it works well.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - AI is helping you expand your options rather than limiting you to only high-resolution sources from the start.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are certain tasks that programs have been pushing for AI to do- specifically in the realm of completing missing parts of an image, changing or removing objects in an image, or otherwise altering a large portion of an image from one thing to another. I don't like using AI for these tasks. I've found that in these cases, the AI can complete the task to a decent and perhaps satisfactory level for the typical user, but it can't do it predictably, and it can't do it precisely the way I want it- if I have a specific vision, or a specific way I like such editing to be done every single time, I can't rely on AI to do the same job consistently and predictably the same way every time, and I can't even hope that it will capture the artistic vision that I have for the piece. It's the difference between using the same paint brush every time to get a predictable consistent result versus picking a new paint brush every single time and hoping you can get it to look the same.

AI: That's a really compelling analogy - the paintbrush comparison really captures the unpredictability issue. It sounds like consistency and artistic control are crucial for you.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Like I said, I try and use it as piece-meal as possible in order to maintain control. If there is a particular technique that I'd have to do over and over to attain a desired look on an image- busywork, essentially- I'll try and see if there's an AI alternative. I'll typically use AI for something like that three or four times on any given project. It doesn't typically significantly change my workflow from what it'd otherwise be, it just helps to expedite otherwise time consuming tasks. So I guess more the latter?

AI: So you're using it more for delegation of specific, repetitive tasks rather than ongoing collaboration. That makes sense given your need for control.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I don't always work in person, it depends on the project. It's been a bit of a conflict overall. A manager of mine has been encouraging us to utilize AI where we can; she keeps up on new tools and programs that we can potentially use, and so sometimes I feel pressured to use it for things that I would otherwise prefer to do myself. But coworkers, because our work is highly creative, really push back on it. They don't want to use it because it feels a little hypocritical and cannibilizing.

AI: That sounds like you're caught between different pressures - management pushing for AI adoption while your creative colleagues are resistant. 

Can you tell me more about that tension? How do you navigate those competing expectations in your day-to-day work?

User: That's more of social management question- when I'm taking to the manager, I try and temper her excitement a bit for AI tools for the sake of my coworkers, but at the same time, I do try and share what I've used them for and keep her informed about what they do well and what they don't do well. At the same time, when I talk to certain coworkers, I try and show them the redundant workload-heavy things that I no longer have to do because an AI tool can do them more quickly. It's definitely a lot of toeing the line at the moment, and I really see the points of both my coworkers and my manager.

AI: It sounds like you're playing a diplomatic role, trying to bridge both perspectives. You mentioned you see both points - can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Okay so I was working on a series of images that all had different subjects, but were all meant to look like they belonged to the same series. They shared colour palettes and broad aesthetics. And on one of the first pieces I did, the AI managed to generate a colour and texture filter over a specific part of the image that I really liked the look of. On a subsequent piece, I tried to get it to replicate that process, and it didn't work. It was *almost* the same, but it definitely wasn't similar enough for the coherency I wanted between the different pieces. I tried to replicate it manually, but it was a pretty labour intensive process and took a lot of trial and error. Eventually I just resolved to do a slightly different technique on each piece but with a similar vibe, so it was fine, but it was really frustrating to get it to do a nice looking thing once and then never be able to replicate that.

AI: That's such a perfect example of the unpredictability issue you mentioned earlier - getting something great once but not being able to reliably reproduce it. That must have been particularly frustrating when working on a cohesive series.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Photoshop specifically has such a range of possible techniques and tricks that I feel like I'm constantly learning how to do something new. When it comes to AI 'taking over' the fields of illustration and image editing, I still feel motivated enough by the satisfaction of doing the work that I'm maintaining skills and learning as I would otherwise do. I somewhat consider it, but at the moment I'd prefer to just prove through my work that I'm more valuable than what an AI can spit out.

AI: That's a really confident approach - focusing on demonstrating your unique value rather than worrying about replacement. It sounds like the satisfaction you get from the creative process itself is a strong motivator.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: My hope is that we'll eventually reach an equilibrium with AI tools and hand-done photo work, where there will be industry standard tasks that it's acceptable to use AI for, while also accepting that there are things that it can never do a fully satisfactory job for.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the tension between management encouragement and creative colleagues' resistance, and how you're navigating that diplomatically while maintaining your artistic vision.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I can't think of anything specifically, besides to say that it's not a super comfortable time to work in artistic spaces. Lol.

AI: I can imagine - it sounds like a period of real uncertainty and change in your field.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control, navigating workplace dynamics, and finding that balance between efficiency and artistic integrity will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Take care!
