Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, that sounds good. I am ready to start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help with writing. I use it to create talking points for job aids. I also use AI to help develop content for powerpoint presentations. I will use it primarily as a thought partner.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a thought partner is a compelling way to describe it. When you say you use it as a thought partner, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically engage with AI when you're developing those talking points or presentation content?

User: I will say something like: Please give 5 ways to engage new customers who may be looking for a mortgage. Then depending on what I receive I will tailor the response like ' can you make that more concise' 'can you tailer that for UHNW clients.' These are examples of things I would ask.

AI: That's a helpful example of your back-and-forth process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like the end product to come from me. It is helpful to use AI to develop the content, but I need the end product to sounds like it is coming from my voice.

AI: That makes sense - maintaining your authentic voice in the final output. Tell me more about that process of making it sound like you. What do you actually do to transform the AI-generated content so it reflects your voice?

User: Yes, I will generally take the information I receive and rewrite it, make it longer, or make it shorter. I will add in specific terminology my company uses as well.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate through a task, like the interaction example I shared before. My company does not have AI tools for us to use, so I will seek out AI tools on my own. I do not tend to completely delegate tasks for this reason. Also, sometimes the tone/phrases used need to be updated so they do not sounds like generic responses.

AI: That's really insightful - so you're proactively seeking out AI tools on your own since your company doesn't provide them. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they know you're using these tools, and if so, what's their reaction?

User: Some of my coworkers use a similar approach from what I understand. We will use AI tools to help us complete our work. On the other hand, we do have some coworkers that do not prefer to use AI tools, and that is likely because our company has not given their blessing, so to speak. But the coworkers that use AI definitely agree it makes things easier.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I will generally try to start projects on my own. However, I was working on job aids about when to use certain lending products. I decided to use a chatbot to help me and it made generating the talking points so much easier! I was glad I thought to do this. I find that getting started is usually the hardest part.

AI: That's a great example of how AI helped you overcome that initial hurdle. You mentioned that getting started is usually the hardest part - how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I find it more of a collaboration. I still need to arrange the job aid, add in specific verbiage, get buy in with stakeholders. I know that AI will become more widely adopted but I do not think it will completely takeover, at least with tasks like this. It may replace some of the more repetitive reporting tasks.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I would hope that my company will widely adopt AI tools. I know they are available in some of the programs we use. However, until then I will use the same approach that I have been.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a thought partner while maintaining your authentic voice in the final output.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that was it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in a workplace that hasn't officially adopted these tools yet, and your collaborative approach to maintaining your authentic voice, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
