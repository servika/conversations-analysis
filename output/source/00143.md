Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a secondary school teacher. I use AI to help me come up with lesson plans, and especially for brainstorming different activities to do. It is used both for specific lesson plans, and organizing how to spread a unit out across a certain number of days. I will also use it develop worksheets. I use it most days but definitely not every day.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using AI for these teaching tasks - like developing lesson plans or creating worksheets - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? Are you working back and forth with the AI throughout the task, or do you tend to give it what you need and let it handle things independently?

User: I go back and forth. I would love to be able to let it handle things independently, but it is too difficult to get an end result that I would be satisfied with. By working together, I can give it more context over time and shape the results into something that I like. 

The only exception would be when I am creating worksheets based off of some written content. In these cases, I can upload the written content and it usually creates a decent worksheet that needs few (if any) changes. But for the most part I work collaboratively with it to develop lessons and brainstorm activities.

AI: That's a really clear picture of your workflow. You mentioned that you'd love to delegate complete tasks but find it difficult to get satisfactory results that way. What specifically makes those results fall short when you try to let AI handle things independently?

User: The lesson plans are generally imperfect and do not meet my standards. As a teacher, lesson plans should be personalised to the style and methods that are appropriate for both me and my students. At this time, AI's do not have all this context so while they provide reasonable lesson plans, they need more tweaking to work for me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the personalization aspect seems crucial. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't let it do marking for me. It can still make mistakes and I think that can set bad standards for students. I should be the one accountable for my students work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on accountability. Tell me more about that - what drives your thinking around being personally accountable for your students' work?

User: That's the job as a teacher, to be accountable to my students. If I use AI to grade and make a mistake, students lose their trust in me and that'll make it much harder for me to teach to them.

AI: That trust element is really interesting. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are teachers at your school generally open about using these tools, or is it something you navigate more independently?

User: The teachers in my department are generally open about using it. Specifically, they talk about using it to develop worksheets/activities. I haven't really discussed lesson planning with AI with anyone. 

Several of the younger teachers have talked about using AI during lessons, specifically when running simulation activies during classes.

AI: That's fascinating about the younger teachers using AI during live lessons. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I generally use powerpoints for my lessons. I have not been satisfied with the ability of AI's to generate complete powerpoints for me, based off the lessons plans that I create collaboratively with them. They do not seem to be able to do this for me. They can give some suggestions on the layout of the powerpoint, but I think they should be able to create one themselves.

AI: That gap between what you feel AI should be able to do and what it actually delivers sounds frustrating. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Rather than maintaining my skills where AI can be used, I focus on enhancing or changing my skills so that I can use AI to come up with a better process/result.

AI: That's a really interesting approach - adapting your skills to work better with AI rather than protecting areas from it. Can you give me an example of how you've enhanced or changed your skills in this way?

User: As it allows me to create lesson plans more efficiently, it gives me more time to focus on creating more interesting and engaging lessons.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in specific ways as the technology develops?

User: Hopefully, it gets better at understanding me and how I like to teach. This will allow it to give me better lesson plans and activities from the start, cutting down on the amount of collaboration and time needed to get to the result I desire. 

I could imagine AI platforms designed specifically for education, that would allow for the AI to remember more about me AND more about my different classes, so they could even personalize between different classes.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on accountability with student grading and how you're adapting your skills to work more effectively with AI rather than protecting certain areas from it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI use in teaching, the importance of trust and accountability with students, and your vision for more education-specific AI tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
