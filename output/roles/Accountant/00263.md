Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.  We can start

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For sure.  I have two different jobs that I use AI at.  The first job, I use it sparingly.  I mostly use it for rewriting communications like emails.  I have to write a lot of professional emails to different organizations that can be challenging as I often have to decline things, so I use AI to help me craft professional emails.  In this job, I also do a lot of presentations.  I do not use AI to craft the presentation itself but sometimes I will use it for brainstorming titles or helping with rewording notes pages for the presentations.

I use it a bit broader in my second job.  I have my own private business.  I will also use it to write emails in this setting as well but much more sparsely, as I write fewer emails at this job.  I use it more creatively for things like social media brainstorming, re-wording social media captions, and design ideas.  I have also used it for writing ad copy but much more sparingly, just because I don't need to write ad copy often.  I also use it to do things like brainstorm lists that are related to my field of work, coming up with plans for my clients that I then edit and refine, and to help with troubleshooting.  For example, if I have an issue with my website and can't figure it out myself, I might use AI to help with that.  I also use it to synthesize answers to topics that I already know but want something somewhat well written that I can just edit.  I do not use it to research a topic that I do not know about.  In this second job, somedays I will be using AI off and on for the whole day and then I'll have other days where I use it less.

AI: That's a really helpful overview of how you use AI across both roles. I'm particularly interested in something you mentioned - that you don't use AI to research topics you don't already know about. 

Can you tell me more about that distinction? What drives your decision to use AI for synthesizing information on familiar topics but not for exploring new areas?

User: I have found that it's more work for me to double check AI's work than to do the research myself.  I tried a couple of times to use it for researching new areas but found that there were a lot of hallucinations, misinterpretation of the data and that it didn't always pull from the most recent research or the research that was done the best.  It was actually taking me more time to use AI then to do it on my own.  I work in a healthcare field so it is very important that the evidence that I am pulling from is solid.  It's tempting with AI just to take it at its word.  If I'm using it to synthesize information on familiar topics, I can scan pretty quickly and easily make sure that everything is correct and that it is not hallucinating or being misleading, so its really useful for that.  Then I can just let it know where it's made a mistake, and I can get it to correct it, but if I'm not familiar with the topic then I find that I need to go research it myself anyways, so I just tend to do it on my own.

AI: That makes a lot of sense, especially given the importance of accuracy in healthcare. It sounds like your familiarity with the topic acts as a quality control mechanism.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several tasks where AI could potentially help - like creating entire presentations or doing complete troubleshooting. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could assist with them?

User: There's a few things that I would still prefer to do myself.  One would be accounting related stuff.  For two reasons, first I found that this is another area where AI makes a lot of mistakes and second, I find that I have a better grasp as to where my business is at when I do it on my own.  If I am going to be the one presenting something, I also prefer to do the bulk of the work on my own for the presentation just because I then learn the presentation as I make it.  Like I said, I'll use AI to rephrase something or to help consolidate notes pages, or brainstorm a title, but the majority of the work I do on my own. 
I also still prefer to handle charting on my own.  Mostly because there isn't an approved AI charting system with the organization that I currently work with, so for regulatory reasons, it's better that I don't use AI for charting.  I know this is coming along though, so I expect that it will change in next 1-2 years.

AI: That's really insightful - you've identified some clear boundaries based on both practical considerations and deeper strategic thinking. The point about learning presentations as you create them is particularly interesting.

When you do use AI for work, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to do a lot more collaboration.  Again, because I'm in healthcare and there are standards of practice and stuff that I have to abide by, I find that I need to give AI a decent amount of guidance as it works.  Sometimes I will get it to do some brainstorming or work on a design while I'm doing another task, but I generally come back and review it with AI afterwards. One, because I want to act professionally, and two, because of regulations in my field.

AI: That collaborative approach makes sense given the regulatory environment you're working in. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that the attitudes or policies at either of your jobs have shaped how you approach using these tools?

User: A lot of my colleagues at my one job are older than me and are less informed about AI vs me.  I would say that they're a lot more uncomfortable using it just because they are unfamiliar with best practices when using AI in healthcare settings.  I do have a couple of coworkers who use it as well.  Sometimes I am hesitant to tell them that I have used AI because I feel like sometimes it is frowned upon, but overall with the ways that I use it, they actually haven't had any issues.  In my own private business, as long as it follows the rules of the regulatory college that I am a part of, I use it essentially however would be most useful that day to me.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - feeling hesitant to share your AI use even when you're confident it's appropriate and helpful. It sounds like there's a bit of a generational divide in comfort levels.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used it recently to help brainstorm ideas for a large convention that a coworker and I will be attending.  It actually provided really good ideas once I clarified what it was that I wanted.  My coworker and I were both very satisfied with the results.

Recently, I was using for some union stuff related to work.  I was trying to understand something new in the agreement to find if it was relevant to our day-to-day work and compare it to another agreement.  It kept giving me information that I knew was blatantly wrong.  It was a very frustrating conversation because I kept correcting it, and it kept making the same mistake over and over again.  Also, sometimes it tries to be too helpful, which can be annoying.

AI: That's a great contrast - the convention brainstorming success versus the frustrating union agreement situation. The pattern you describe with it making the same mistake repeatedly despite corrections sounds particularly aggravating.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't really thought about it a lot.  My area is niche enough that AI won't take over a large part of my tasks in the new future.  I guess that it could take over mundane day-to-day tasks like charting and stuff, but I would still have to review everything for regulatory reasons, so I would have to still somewhat keep up my skills in this area, otherwise I could be open to lawsuits.

AI: That makes sense - the regulatory oversight requirements essentially build in skill maintenance for you.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as workplace attitudes shift?

User: Even over the last two years, I have seen a huge increase in the usefulness of AI and its abilities.  In my job where I don't work for myself, I think that we will start using it more and more.  They've created a committee to start looking at how we can use AI more.  I think that over the next few years, it will likely take over some more of the mundane, day-to-day tasks.  I do think people are becoming more open to it now that there aren't as many glitches.  There are still a lot of things that it currently can't do for me at work (or at least not to my standards), but I think that I will continue to increase my usage.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your healthcare background creates this interesting balance - using AI as a collaborative partner while maintaining the expertise to quality-check its output, and how regulatory requirements actually protect skill maintenance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's everything

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in a regulated healthcare environment, the generational differences you've observed, and your thoughtful approach to collaboration versus delegation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through both of your work contexts - it gives us a rich picture of how AI fits into different professional scenarios. Have a great rest of your day!
