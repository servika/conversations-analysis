Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I dont have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use it for brainstorming, or problem solving. It helps me think through things. I am a senior accountant and if I am unsure if a charge needs to hit the balance sheet or P&L or how to properly move a charge, I usually talk it through with AI. I also use it when I need to draft an email that contains certain professional verbage to be in line with our contracts.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're talking through those accounting decisions with AI - like whether a charge should hit the balance sheet or P&L - can you walk me through what that conversation typically looks like? Are you describing the full situation and asking for a recommendation, or is it more of a back-and-forth discussion?

User: It is mostly a back and forth discussion. I will say, I have these accounts, this is the charge, I am unsure of where it needs to go.  For example, in th past I was unsure about our Fedral Tax prepayments becuase we pay sales tax monthly, but also do an accrual. Whereas the Fedral tax prepayments are quarterly and we do not do an accrual for them. I just use it as a helpful took to think things through. Obviously the AI wouldnt be able to tell me exactly what to do, since it doesnt have access to our books, so it is more of a back and forth conversation.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as a thinking partner when you need to work through the logic. When you have these back-and-forth conversations about complex accounting situations like that federal tax example, what does AI bring to the discussion that's most valuable to you? Is it helping you see different angles, or confirming your thinking, or something else?

User: Its both. Its helping me see different angles and getting me to think in a way I normally wouldnt, but then also confirming that my choice after our conversation is still accurate.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: My work just rolled out an new AI program that can read invoices and auto fill our accouting program. I prefer to manually enter invoices. I pride myself on doing accurate work and I think it leaves too much room for error. If I am having to go back in and check to make sure that the AI submitted everything properly I would rather just do it myself manually and know it is correct.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction. So with the invoice processing, you're concerned about having to double-check the AI's work, but with the accounting decision conversations, you're comfortable using AI as a thinking partner. What makes you feel confident about the reliability in those brainstorming conversations versus the invoice processing?

User: I feel as doing  checking the invoices, I am doing the work already, so submitting them to AI would be an extra step. Accouting decisions, its an active conversation that I am already versed in and can easily tell if the AI is not being truthful. The example in the accounting decisions is like a thinking board that helps me get my ideas across to come to a conclusion

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: no, I think I use it more than others at my workplace.

AI: Tell me more about that. What do you think leads you to use AI more than your colleagues? Is it something about your role, your approach to work, or something else entirely?

User: I think I am just more familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the models. I use it so much in my private life ( it has become the new google for me), that I just kinda know when it will be hepful and when it wont.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I work on a big budget vs actuals that takes all of our OPEX spending for the month and compares it to the budget for the year. This is a complex file that gets sent out the business managers each month. I was asked to add some graphs into excel to make the data easier to understand. I had submitted this to the AI and it just fell flat. None of the graphs really made sense and couldnt even direct me on how to make graphs for it on my own. It was  frustrating as my excel skills are not a strong suit for graphs and I thought the AI would be a helpful tool, but it wasnt.

AI: That sounds really frustrating, especially when you were counting on it to help with something outside your comfort zone. What do you think went wrong there? Was it that the AI didn't understand the complexity of your budget data, or something else about how graphs work in that context?

User: I think it was a mix of not being accurate on Excel functions and graphs while also not understanding the data. The file had multiple tabs and it seemed to only pull data from one.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. As I spoke about before with the AI that can read invoices, there is still someone who has to double check the work and I dont see that going away. So I think the skills will always be there to check the work and human thinking also has a lot of value.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I work for an energy retail supplier that is going into the Texas market. The Texas market is much different from others as it has a lot of rules and regulations. I see my relationship growing and using it more to really understand that market and ERCOT.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI as a thinking partner for complex accounting decisions while maintaining control over tasks that require accuracy verification.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I dont think so

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about distinguishing between AI as a collaborative thinking partner versus AI as a task executor will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
