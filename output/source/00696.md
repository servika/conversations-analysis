Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm an online tutor and I work with students all the way from Kindergarten through college in all subjects. I sometimes use AI for writing lesson plans or researching specific topics that my students need help with.

AI: That sounds like AI serves a really practical role in your tutoring work. When you're writing those lesson plans or researching topics, what does that process typically look like for you? Walk me through how you approach it.

User: Sometimes I just need AI to make a practice test for me to use with a student. For example, I might ask AI to create a practice test on solving multi-step algebra equations for a 7th grade student. Sometimes, if I haven't had time to create a lesson plan for a particular student, I will ask AI to create a one-hour or two-hour lesson plan based on a skill or two or three related skills that student is working on. With high school and college students, I sometimes ask AI questions we are looking for the answers to, regarding science or history. There are also times that I ask AI to help me come up with higher-level questions to explore with a student to prepare them for an exam.

AI: It sounds like you're using AI across a really wide range of preparation tasks. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are some tasks I don't ask AI for help with because I don't think they will render well. For example, this week, I needed to create a practice test for a college student on Intersection of Sets, Union of Sets and Venn Diagrams. I did not ask AI for help because I didn't think the practice test it created would be correctly formatted.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction you make about formatting. So it sounds like when visual elements or specific formatting are crucial, you handle those yourself. 

Are there other types of tasks beyond formatting issues where you prefer to keep control, even if AI could potentially help?

User: If a student needs help with editing a paper, I prefer to do that myself, because AI often creates content that is obviously written above the level that a student of a certain age would write. When I teach writing, I try to make sure that the writing that the student is producing is age-appropriate and uses the student's own words. I simply help my students to make sure that all relevant aspects of a topic are discussed and that their writing is well-formatted, with no grammatical or structural errors.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining authenticity in the student's voice seems really important to you as an educator. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently.

AI: So you're more of a "here's what I need, go do it" approach rather than working back and forth with AI on the same task. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Since I am a self-employed tutor, workplace culture is not much of a factor in how I use AI, although I do interact with students and their parents. I generally turn to AI for help with tasks that I do not have time to do, or ask AI specific questions that arise while helping a student to complete an assignment for school.

AI: That's helpful context - being self-employed definitely gives you more autonomy in how you integrate AI. Since you mentioned using AI for tasks you don't have time for or when specific questions come up with students, can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Since I am not an expert in science, when students have science study guides to complete or scientific questions to answer for an assignment, it is particularly satisfying when AI gives an explanation that is on a level that my student can easily understand and which is appropriate for them to fill in on their study guide or question sheet. This was the case with a particular science study guide that one of my students was working on this past week.

AI: That sounds like a really rewarding moment when AI helped you bridge that gap between your expertise and what your student needed. It must feel good to be able to support them effectively even in subjects that aren't your strongest area.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Regarding tutoring, I don't really concern myself with being replaced by AI, because I build personal relationships with my students and their families and they tend to stay with me throughout their academic careers. From my experience, I have found that parents would not want to have to ask AI questions on behalf of their child and students often don't know exactly what to ask. I am very experienced with interacting with a student to find out where he or she is having difficulty and I think both the parents and the students appreciate the human touch and having a real person to talk to and learn from.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - you've identified what seems to be the irreplaceable human element of your work: the relationship-building and diagnostic skills to figure out exactly where a student is struggling.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: When AI becomes more capable of creating math tests that include all of the geometric figures and symbols, as well as other visual elements, that I need it to include, I will use it to create more of the practice tests that I create for my students.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the human elements of relationship-building and diagnostic skills make your role irreplaceable, even as you strategically use AI for time-saving tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I can't think of anything else to add.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically integrate AI as a preparation tool while maintaining the essential human elements of tutoring will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Glad to help!

AI: Thank you so much! Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your tutoring work.

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
