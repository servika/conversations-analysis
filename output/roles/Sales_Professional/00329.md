Assistant: Hello! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great, I'm ready to go when you are.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do a lot of communicating with clients so if I need to draft an e-mail for a particular client that I know will take a lot of time I'll request AI to put together the main body and then I'll edit it from there. Additionally, for things like creating marketing materials I'll either work in conjunction with AI to create images or ask them to review images that I've made already. Once a week or so I'll feed in some analytical data from sales etc to compare against previous weeks/month and ask for tips on improving conversion rates.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of applications. I'm curious about your email drafting process specifically - when you say you know an email will take a lot of time, what makes you recognize that moment where you decide to bring AI into the process rather than just writing it yourself?

User: If I know there are multiple points that I'll need to bring up that might not necessarily flow together and will require a lot of thought on my part, it's much easier for me to give AI 6 or 7 bullet points and ask it to expand on them rather than sitting away and typing paragraphs to a client. Usually, AI can cover the majority of what I want to go over and from there it's much quicker just to edit it to ensure everything is flushed out. This way I can leave it in the background while I start another task and come back to it.

AI: That multitasking aspect is really interesting - being able to set AI working on something and move to another task. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several different types of tasks - emails, marketing materials, data analysis. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The actual sales outreach to clients I prefer to do myself, I'm sure that AI could help with it but I'm confident in my own abilities and quite enjoy the challenge of working out a person through calls/emails rather than letting AI tell me how to proceed.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's something about that direct human connection and reading the person that you want to keep in your own hands.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate with it for the marketing tasks, IE for image creation or image review we'll probably exchange 8-10 messages per instance where I request changes or make amendments myself and ask it for advice on how it looks. With regards to the creation of emails or data analysis I delegate complete tasks and most likely will only send the initial prompt with possibly one follow-up, and then utilise the response myself without any further discussion with the AI.

AI: That's a clear distinction between the collaborative work on creative materials versus the more delegated approach for emails and analysis. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues and workplace have been rather slow adaptors to AI, and whilst it is used within the programs that we use for data collection etc, using it independently has not been massively adopted by others. As such, I like to think it gives me a slight advantage against others and find that I have slightly more time to get things done than others around me.

AI: So you're somewhat of an early adopter compared to your colleagues, and you're seeing that translate into efficiency gains. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One of the first times I used AI for work related materials I fed it a complete email conversation that I'd had with a client and asked it to capture the tone of the recipient and create an email response that would go some way to alleviating their anxiety over a previous job going wrong, and convince them that we'd be able to keep them happy moving forward. Whilst this was something I could have done myself, I really was getting nowhere with the conversation and wanted to try a different approach. To my surprise, the response that was generated managed to articulate everything in a way that I hadn't been able to thus far and the client seemed to ease up following that response. It was probably at that point that I realised that it could be a potential gamechanger.

AI: That sounds like a real breakthrough moment - when AI helped you find a way through a conversation that had gotten stuck. You mentioned that was one of your first times using it for work materials.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about maintaining my skills in areas where AI could take over, albeit I think I'm generally in a position where I am quite safe as I believe humans are always going to prefer speaking to other humans for sales related materials. As such, whilst I enjoy keeping up to date with marketing material creation, and generating texts and data analysis, I'm hoping that the elevation of AI can only help to make my job even easier.

AI: That confidence in your core human-to-human sales skills really comes through. It sounds like you see AI as enhancing rather than replacing what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision AI being able to be left to its own devices more, perhaps I'll send an initial prompt and the response that comes back would be golden 9 times out of 10 without any need for further prompting. This would allow me to feed it more tasks and increase the amount of time I can spend actually communicating with people rather than doing background tasks that are important but less fun.

AI: That vision of AI handling more of the background work so you can focus on the human interactions you enjoy is really compelling.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how that breakthrough moment with the difficult client conversation showed you AI's potential, and how you see it as amplifying your strengths rather than replacing them.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's about everything covered, great to chat with you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI for different types of tasks, the advantage you've gained as an early adopter, and that pivotal moment with the client email will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It was great to chat with you too. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
