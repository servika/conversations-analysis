Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Okay, let's go... I'm ready

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a fiction writer, but I don't really use AI to write prose. I have tried to use it for ideation in the past, but never actually used any of the ideas I've gotten, not directly anyway, and have generally stopped trying to brainstorm fiction ideas with AI.  The way things have settled out, I use it in three ways. First, I use it for research... A lot of times AI can make it a lot easier to find obscure facts, especially things that are hard to look up with ordinary search engines. Secondly, I use it as a sort of coach/writing pal... I talk about my creative issues, my process, writing faster, writer's block, marketing ideas, book genres and conventions, story structure... And I use it to get help with life/work balance issues.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found these specific niches where AI adds value to your writing process without directly creating the prose itself.

Tell me more about that research function - what kinds of obscure facts or hard-to-search information do you typically need help finding? Can you give me an example of something AI helped you discover that would have been difficult to find otherwise?

User: For example, I was writing a scene set on a lake, describing cabins, describing things you would typically see at one of those touristy state parks... You know, campsites, walking trails, all that stuff... Sometimes it's hard to remember what certain things are called, especially in the moment. Things you walk past every day, like the concrete platforms they put the public garbage cans on, or like particular architectural features on a building. And it can be hard to look that stuff up, because you don't even know what search terms to use... And this problem can get even harder if you're writing something like Historical fiction. But with AI, you can just describe whatever's giving you trouble, and quickly find the right words to use.

AI: That makes perfect sense - that challenge of knowing what you're looking for but not having the right vocabulary to search for it. It sounds like AI helps bridge that gap between your visual memory and the specific terminology.

When you mentioned using AI as a "coach/writing pal" for creative issues and process questions - what does a typical conversation like that look like? How do you usually approach it when you're working through something like writer's block or story structure?

User: I'm pretty goal oriented with those conversations. I'll usually do a really long first prompt, lay out my problem in great detail. A lot of times, I'll also provide the AI with some background about my approach to writing, and my genre, and the various issues I've had over the years... I might tell it things I've tried before, what worked for me and what didn't. I like to put the AI in the ballpark before I begin.

AI: That detailed setup approach sounds very strategic. When you give AI all that context upfront about your writing approach and what's worked or hasn't worked for you in the past, how does that typically shape the kind of guidance you get back?

And once you get that initial response, do you usually continue the conversation back and forth, or do you tend to take that advice and work with it on your own?

User: It usually helps with the guidance, but a lot of times I still have to add even more context in future prompts... Usually something will be off with the first couple of answers, and I'll have to give the AI a little more to work with. This is because I do have kind of an odd writing process, and a lot of the typical solutions don't work for me. I have to provide a lot of upfront detail to put the AI in the right ballpark. For the second question, there's usually a certain amount of back and forth with these conversations. Once I get the AI on the right wavelength, I will work through the problem for a while. I want a lot of suggestions, and usually I don't even do what the AI tells me. I sort of use it as a sounding board. It give me some ideas, and then those cause me to come up with other ideas, and then I'll send them back to the AI, see what it thinks... This can go on for a while.

AI: That's a fascinating way of using it - more as a thinking partner than someone giving you direct solutions to implement. It sounds like the real value comes from that iterative process where the AI's suggestions spark your own ideas, which then lead to new directions.

When you say you have "kind of an odd writing process" that typical solutions don't work for - what makes your approach different? What are some of those typical suggestions that just don't fit how you work?

User: I'm mostly pantser, but I do a small amount of planning... Usually I'm thinking about 10k words ahead at any given time. I sometimes write out of order. I write really messy first drafts, and have a very strange planning process that's built around snippets of random moments I see ahead of myself. It's a very organic process, not particularly structured. And a lot of the typical suggestions are counter productive for me.

AI: That organic, snippet-based approach sounds like it requires a very different kind of problem-solving than traditional structured methods. 

Can you give me an example of a typical suggestion that AI might offer that would be counterproductive for your process? What happens when you get advice that's aimed at a more traditional planning approach?

User: When I get advice that doesn't work for me, I tell the AI to give me something different. I explain why it won't work in the hopes that the next piece of advice will make more sense. A lot of times the AI will provide very regimented suggestions, paint by numbers things that I've tried already... Obvious things that I already know about, and have already suggested mentally.

AI: That back-and-forth to get the AI past the obvious suggestions sounds like it requires some persistence on your part. 

When you do finally get advice or suggestions that feel more aligned with your organic process, what does that look like? What makes those responses feel more useful compared to the regimented ones?

User: The useful advice will typically be something genuinely novel. Something that feels catered to my very specific situation/needs. It'll be something totally new that I haven't already found in some writing craft book somewhere.

AI: That specificity seems really key - getting something tailored rather than generic writing advice.

I'm curious about the third way you mentioned using AI - for life and work balance issues. How does that work alongside your writing support? Are those separate conversations, or do they sometimes blend together when you're working through creative challenges?

User: They often blend together because my writing issues are often caused by other stuff going on in my life. So a lot of the time, I'm trying to find a better way of organizing my work day, or looking for ways to get more leisure time in, to help avoid burnout. Looking for ways to write faster, so I can have more time for other important things.

AI: That holistic view makes a lot of sense - that your writing productivity is connected to how the rest of your life is working.

When you're working through these broader life and work balance questions with AI, do you find yourself having to provide the same kind of detailed context about your personal situation that you do with your writing process? Or does that type of advice feel more immediately applicable?

User: Still have to give the AI a lot of context. For example, I need to tell it about health issues, my day to day challenges... The advice won't help me if it's not catered to my life situation.

AI: It sounds like across all these different uses - research, writing coaching, and life balance - there's this consistent pattern of needing to invest time upfront to get the AI properly contextualized to your specific situation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: When it comes to anything deeply creative, like developing my story or creating prose, I don't want any sort of collaborator. I don't want ideas from the AI to get into my head. The whole point of writing is to do it myself. Also, I know that readers want to read books written by people, not by computers. At the end of the day, letting AI write your prose is self-defeating, because people enjoy stories because they are connecting with other people. There's a personal bond in creative works, between the creator and the audience, and the more authentic your work is, the more it comes directly from YOU, the more readers will respond, especially in the long term.

AI: That's a really clear boundary you've drawn - keeping the creative core completely your own while using AI as a support tool around the edges. The distinction you're making about authentic human connection through creative work is striking.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: As I said, I only use it for research, and process questions. So it's more of a "drop in occasionally for help" pattern.  I don't keep it on all the time.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you have a pretty intentional, episodic approach rather than having AI as a constant presence.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? As a fiction writer, I imagine your work environment might be quite different from a traditional office setting.

User: I'm all alone most of the time when doing my writing, so no. I work at home, alone in my writing space.

AI: That isolation gives you complete freedom to develop your own approach without external pressures.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Initially, I did try using AI for ideation... I got some good ideas, at least in theory, but just didn't feel comfortable using them. It just didn't feel like it was coming from me, and I ultimately dropped them. Another time, trying to get ideas, I ran into filters. Some of my writing is in horror and erotica, and I kept running into problems where the AI was uncomfortable with the subject matter.

AI: That discomfort with using the AI-generated ideas really reinforces what you said earlier about authenticity being so important to you.

Tell me more about running into those content filters with your horror and erotica writing. How did that affect your workflow, and did it influence how you approach using AI for other aspects of your work?

User: It probably helped convince me to avoid using AI in my core creative work. Sometimes you have to write about uncomfortable things. That's normal in fiction of all kinds. Good fiction is often all about exploring topics at the edge of normal life. The AI tools, at least the very good ones, tend to put fences around things. They are inherently restrictive due to the need for mass market adoption, which is incompatible with the needs of fiction writing.

AI: That tension between mass market safety requirements and the need for creative freedom in fiction is really illuminating. It sounds like those restrictions reinforced your instinct to keep the creative work separate.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I've given it a lot of consideration, but ultimately I don't think fiction writing is going to be harmed as much as some might fear. There will be AI written works, and in certain genres people will make a lot of money writing them, but in the end readers don't want that. When they see it, they'll turn on those writers. I feel like there will always be a premium on human creativity for certain fields. AI will probably continue to play a supporting role, more for some writers than others, but I don't think it will replace fiction writers.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding the ways you use it, or do you think you'll mostly stick with the current pattern you've established?

User: For writing fiction, I plan to stick with the current approach. But I can envision a future where whole new artforms appear that almost require AI... I'm looking at things like AI video, which I think will eventually evolve into an interesting arena. I can imagine writing stories and using AI video to produce content that I could put up on Youtube. That feels a little different to me because you're using the AI as a collaborator to handle things that wouldn't ordinarily be possible on an ordinary person's budget. In that kind of context, AI becomes a tool for creativity... Film directors collaborate with a crew, but they're still "authoring" their works. In the future anybody will be able to take on that director role, to make movies, games... Who knows what? The AIs can be your team of collaborators. So I'm not entirely down on the idea of using AI as a creative partner. For writing fiction, FOR ME, it's a bad fit because producing text is something I can do right now without money, or teams, and it's something I enjoy doing myself. But if I were a visual artist, I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to using AI to help create stories that would go with my visual ideas... There needs to be a core of human creativity in any sort of art, but as long as that's there, AI can work sort of like a force multiplier, making it possible for one person to do things that would ordinarily take 100s.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your relationship with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that authentic creative core while being open to AI as a force multiplier in different creative contexts - that distinction between what you can already do well yourself versus what might require resources you don't currently have access to.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that pretty much covers it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between maintaining creative authenticity while strategically using AI as a support tool will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've developed such clear boundaries and intentional practices around AI use in your creative work. Thanks again!
