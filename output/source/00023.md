Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, ready to go

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am producing a non-profit documentary about nature and have the responsibility of researching a lot of preliminary information having to do with pre-production (e.g. the development of the film treatment, information about fiscal sponsors, budgetary planning, film festival timelines, etc.)

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful project. Nature documentaries can have such a powerful impact.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Any time I need an answer that would take too long or be too difficult to find on Google

AI: Tell me more about that. What kinds of questions or research challenges does AI help you tackle that Google doesn't handle as well?

User: Here's an example: trying to determine how much licensed archival footage costs on average would be almost impossible on Google, because I would be faced with advertisements, disparate information, and overviews that don't give me the level of specificity needed to answer the question. That's what I think AI models are best at - synthesizing information into a clear, direct, and coherent response that saves me a lot of time.

AI: That's a really concrete example - I can see how getting that kind of synthesized, specific information would be much more efficient than sifting through search results.

Can you describe a specific recent project or task where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you were working through it?

User: This is a more creative application, but I needed to generate a cover for the film treatment and I used an AI model to help generate the images that I then positioned in a specific way in order to create the scene (they were plants and small animals that adhered to a very specific aesthetic style). I've found that when requesting something like this, you need to be very specific and explain the most important elements that you want. Then, once a style has been established, the model does a great job of replicating that style across all subsequent prompts (if requested)

AI: That's fascinating - you're describing a really collaborative approach where you're directing the visual elements but letting AI handle the execution within your established style.

When you're working with AI in situations like that cover creation, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am, because I know exactly what I want, so I'm asking the model to initially generate to my specifications and then iterate / refine based on my feedback

AI: That's a clear sense of creative control you're describing. It sounds like you see AI as more of a sophisticated tool that executes your vision rather than a creative partner that's contributing its own ideas.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The speed with which I'm able to complete things (as one example, it's made graphic design a lot faster and easier)

AI: That efficiency gain sounds significant. When you think about that increased speed - particularly in areas like graphic design - how has that affected the quality or depth of your creative work? Are you able to explore more ideas, or does it change your process in other ways?

User: The quality of what I'm able to produce is higher on the whole because generating something based on my instructions is far more effective than querying for something based on my parameters.

AI: That's an interesting distinction - generating versus querying. It sounds like having AI create something to your exact specifications gives you more control over the outcome than searching for something that already exists.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in documentary filmmaking more broadly?

User: None, because documentaries rely on capturing real-world footage. I only see AI as a tool that allows for more efficient work on behalf of smaller teams, not a threat to the end product.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the core of documentary work is still that real-world capture that AI can't replace.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Are there areas where you'd want to see it become more capable, or ways you might use it differently?

User: Perhaps more specific or specialized applications. Instead of running these requests through a general chatbot, I would be able to use something that's already fine-tuned for the specific task at hand. More consistency in the quality of the output would be the main way I'd want to see it become more capable. Sometimes it falls into feedback loops of quality degradation where the desired creation gets worse instead of better despite very thoughtful commentary. It often seems like the AI's first creation is its best.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the quality degradation in iterative feedback - it sounds frustrating when you're trying to refine something and it actually gets worse despite clear direction.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as an efficient synthesis tool for complex research questions, and your clear sense of maintaining creative control while leveraging AI's execution capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's it, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for research synthesis, the efficiency gains in graphic design, and especially that observation about quality degradation in iterative feedback will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how clearly you articulated your approach to maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as a sophisticated execution tool. Best of luck with your nature documentary - it sounds like a wonderful project!
