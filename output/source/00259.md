Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, let's begin.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI extensively. As a tutor and provider of educational consultancy, I use AI for lesson planning. This can be a everything from a quick task to creating whole course outlines. I often go back to previous conversations I've had on a particular topic or if I have developed lessons for a particular type of learner so that the AI can build on that conversation. I also use AI for quick fact checking, especially Perplexity. Finally, at times I have run through work related questions with AI, including tutoring rates and some legal questions around employment.

AI: That's a really comprehensive integration of AI into your work. You mentioned going back to previous conversations to build on them - can you tell me more about that process? How do you typically structure those follow-up conversations with AI?

User: That depends on context. At times I will return to the conversation because I want to develop further content that is related to something that I have developed previously. An example would be teaching a specific historical topic. At other times it's because I have developed different types of content but for one learner and so I've already told the AI about things like level and mode of delivery. In one case I even created a GPT for an IELTs student.

AI: That custom GPT for the IELTS student sounds particularly interesting. What led you to create that specific tool rather than just continuing with regular conversations?

User: I wanted to provide the AI with a knowledge base about the content of the IELTs exam and various examples of how that content is taught. I was then able to be sure that the output from my questions were more focused. I figured a GPT would be better and it would also be easier for me to locate the conversation. I taught this student for several months.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - building that specialized knowledge base for ongoing work. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your tutoring and consultancy work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Yes, I definitely prefer to give feedback on any written assignments myself. I have many years of giving feedback and I feel that I can do it faster and better, even if I put the marking criteria into AI. When it comes to quizzes I am happy to have the AI give feedback though.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making between written assignments and quizzes for feedback. What is it about giving feedback on written work that makes you feel you can do it faster and better than AI, even with detailed criteria?

User: It's my experience as a writer and a teacher. I feel that I can pinpoint what the student has done wrong really well and relate this to the marking criteria. While there is much to be gained from using AI to help with feedback, I've had many years of reading student essays to work out where a student is failing on say clarity or being able to structure an argument.

AI: That expertise really comes through in how you describe it. When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I almost always collaborate with AI. I haven't been delegating tasks through agent use or anything like that.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration. What does a typical collaborative interaction look like when you're working through something with AI?

User: There are various ways and it depends on the type of prompt I write initially. If I'm being lazy or write a poor prompt then it usually takes several iterations to get what I want out of the models. However, if I'm doing a piece of research for example I will think more carefully about the prompt, especially with deep research. Indeed, I normally do preliminary non-AI research to provide context for my prompting. I also work with multiple models to build the perfect prompt, especially if it's an area I don't know much about. A recent example is market research.

AI: That market research example sounds like it involved some real strategic thinking. Can you walk me through what that process looked like - how you approached building up your understanding and crafting those prompts across different models?

User: Sure, I wanted to know more about educational offerings outside traditional settings. I put a very basic list of criteria into Claude and asked it to come up with a prompt as a market researcher. I did the same with GPT and then ran the longer prompts on Claude, GPT, and also deep seek. I am still analysing the results as there is a lot of data there.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned tutoring and consultancy, I'm curious how the educational environment around you has shaped your approach.

User: I was really one of the first to use AI in my organization, especially in the classroom. A lot of colleagues were very hesitant, especially since the earlier models hallucinated so much and produced poor answers. Some were worried about the impact of AI on their pedagogy. My students have responded really well to AI. Although some might be nervous they recognize its importance and appreciate having someone with some expertise to help them to learn how to use AI responsibly.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was really happy when I got the students to create and play in-text adventure games that explored different historical scenarios. These have been improving as the models improve. There have been lots of great discussions about AI and historical accuracy as well as some humour. AI has given me a fresh approach to teaching.

AI: That sounds like such an engaging way to bring history to life! On the flip side, can you think of a time when AI left you feeling frustrated in your work?

User: I think the biggest frustration is the ability of AI to do an ever better job at things. Trying deep research in gemini for the first time made me realise that we urgently need to think about how we redesign assessments that require students to do research, such as undergraduate dissertations. The disconnect between where AI is and where educational organizations and processes are really concerns me.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, certainly! I think that AI will change education to a huge extent and I think it's important to stay abreast of what is going on. I listen to podcasts and regularly try out various new tools and applications. When it comes to fundamental teaching skill, I rely on my long experience in different classrooms. i'm not sure that AI in its current stage of development will ever entirely replace teachers and tutors, although it can definitely supplement them.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will always keep some aspects of research and writing to myself. I'm trained as a historian and still do historical research. I enjoy the intellectual challenge of research and putting together an argument. I also enjoy writing. I think that this will be key to AI going forward. Millions of people play a musical instrument for joy and not as a profession for example  and no matter how good AI gets at something I suspect this will continue. However, AI allows me to be very productive and so I will continue to use it to save time where I can and also to assist in content creation for teaching.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI for productivity while preserving the intellectual activities you find meaningful, like research and writing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that something that is really interesting about AI in education which is starting to become more of an issue is safeguarding, particularly with younger children. There is no doubt that kids are using AI in multiple interesting ways, but often without any real oversight from parents or educational organizations. Just as social media companies have been criticized for content on their platforms, so will AI companies be criticized for some of the interactions children are having. This is a very complex issue and I am not sure how alignment for kids get dealt with, but I suspect that parental controls akin to streaming services may be the way to go.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from your collaborative approach with AI to those important safeguarding considerations for younger learners will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing how you've thoughtfully integrated AI into your educational practice while maintaining clear boundaries around the work you find most meaningful. Thanks again!
