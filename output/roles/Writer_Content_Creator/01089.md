Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you?

User: Sounds good!  Let's get started

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for a variety of tasks.  I'm a Design Technology Manager at Rockwell Group, an architecture firm primarily focused on interior design, and I'm the member of a 3-person team working on expanding the use of BIM in the company via Revit.  This includes setting up and managing of models, but also researching and developing software and custom tools to best fit the company's production and analysis workflows, as well as educating the staff.  I use AI to assist in the development of educational materials (lesson plans, assessment questions) and administrative materials (meeting agendas) and even in image generation for presentations (background graphics, Revit-themed cartoons).  More crucially, I use AI for coding custom tools in pyRevit in order to rapidly respond to project needs (element creation, analysis of peculiar conditions, etc.) and to aid with any questions I might have regarding particularly difficult problems with programs like Revit, AutoCAD, Rhino/Grasshopper, and even Excel.  At my previous job, I used AI to write VBA macros to automate batch editing processes for NYC School Construction Authority specification documents that were based in Microsoft Word.  All in all, my use of AI focuses on ideation and creativity, but also using it as a force multiplier to boost efficiency.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of applications! It sounds like you're leveraging AI across both creative and technical aspects of your role.

Tell me more about using AI as a "force multiplier" - can you walk me through what that looks like in practice when you're developing those custom pyRevit tools?

User: Well, in terms of developing the pyRevit tools, sometimes it could be dependent on office-wide standards, and other times, it can be on a per-project need.  I'll go through both.

Office-Wide:  As an interiors firm, the levels we work on are typically the finish floor level, but there are some elements that may need to be associated with top-of-slab levels, which may be copy/monitored from the core & shell model from the architect of record (AOR) but isn't always if those levels aren't present.  Our template has a global parameter set up to define our typical finish floor height above top of slab, so if those levels aren't present in the AOR, I used AI to develop a pyRevit tool that allows for selection of one or more of our finish floor levels (FFLs), after which the script automatically creates top-of-slab levels below the selected FFLs by the distance set by the global parameter.

Project-Specific:  I'm working on a large project right now where there are multiple consultant models linked in with hundreds of scope boxes.  Revit does not have a Scope Boxes category for its visibility Filters, and the consultants's scope boxes are on multiple worksets and poorly organized, making them difficult to easily turn off or hide.  I used AI to develop a pyRevit tool that scans all loaded linked models, lists what worksets all of the scope boxes are on, and then prompts the user to ask whether they would like to create those exact worksets in the host model for the express purpose of turning their visibility off, so that whatever is on those worksets in the linked model will turn off via pass-through.

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially creating bespoke solutions for very specific workflow challenges. 

When you're working with AI to develop these tools, how do you typically structure that interaction? Are you collaborating back and forth as you build and test the code, or do you give AI the full problem description upfront and have it generate a complete solution?

User: I try to be as specific and comprehensive as possible in the beginning as part of my initial prompt, in order to try for a complete solution right away, but there's always bound to be some iteration.  For example, for that project-specific script analyzing the scope boxes, here was my initial prompt to the AI (ChatGPT 5 Thinking):

"I want to develop a pyRevit script that scans the linked Revit files contained within a host Revit project, finds the scope boxes, and generates a list of the worksets that those scope boxes are on. The output window showing the list should ask if I want to create these worksets.  Selecting Yes will then create those worksets in the model, and selcting no will stop the operation.  You game?"

AI: That's a really clear, actionable prompt! I can see how you're setting up the AI for success by being specific about the inputs, process, and desired outputs.

What happens next in that iteration process? When the AI gives you that first complete solution, what kinds of adjustments or refinements do you typically find yourself needing to make?

User: I paste the code output into the script.py file VSCode, which is located in the folder hosting a toolbar, panels, and pushbuttons of test scripts.  I run the script, and it rarely ever nails it on the first try.  When I get an error, I give screenshots of the error messages and whatever debug information might be available, so that the best corrections can be made.  This particular script took three additional rounds of corrections before it was successful, and with each iteration, I would paste the updated code into the script.py file and run it again in pyRevit.

AI: So you're essentially having a technical troubleshooting conversation with the AI, using those error messages as feedback to guide the refinements.

After those three rounds of corrections, when you finally got that scope box script working successfully - how did that feel? What was your experience in that moment when it finally ran without errors?

User: It was amazing.  All in all, it probably took about 30 minutes of effort, and the output was easily over 100 lines of code.  When I told my boss (the Design Technology Director) about it, she was impressed, and that felt awesome too.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying moment - both the technical achievement and getting that recognition from your boss.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Obviously, I still do things like modeling and drafting myself, as AI can't really handle those things fully yet, but in terms of things I still prefer to do, I'd say that I still prefer to write emails myself.  We use Microsoft 365 at my office, so we have access to M365 Copilot in Outlook, and I've tried having it draft emails for me before, but Copilot doesn't seem to get things right well enough for me, in terms of better understanding my tone and phrasing patterns.  I end up having to do a lot of rework and editing.

AI: That's an interesting distinction - it sounds like the email tone and voice really matter to you, and the effort to get AI to match your communication style isn't worth the potential time savings.

When you think about those coding tasks versus email writing, what do you think makes the difference in terms of where AI adds value for you versus where it doesn't quite hit the mark?

User: Well I would be interested in having the AI match my communication style, and believe it or not, I spent a lot of time conversing with ChatGPT and that model has matched my style quite well, so doing the same with another model feels like starting over again.  I know these models are all proprietary (and even in competition with one another...or at least their developers are), but if there were a way to be able to connect them to one another across a common account so that something like communication style can be easily shared and transferable, that would be an amazing thing.

To answer your question though, the AI adds value for me because I don't know how to code well.  I made minor efforts to try to learn over the years, but was always stopped along the way.  This has added value because I know the kinds of tools I want to create and use, and I have the ability to describe these tools using natural language.  I think you can tell from these conversations that I have the ability to write well, and that I value comprehensiveness.  My ability to naturally describe the things I want in detail make up for the shortfall in my technical ability to create these solutions myself.  Since email is already a natural language platform, the AI needs to be better at understanding my perspective within the context of the thread, but it's not a mindreader, so it won't exactly know how I might approach a problem or answer a question.  It can make a best guess and try to answer as a facsimile of me, but it might not do it as optimally as I could.

AI: That's a really insightful analysis - you've essentially found the sweet spot where your strengths in natural language and problem description complement AI's technical capabilities, but in areas where you're already fluent like email communication, AI becomes more of a bottleneck than an accelerator.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to be more collaborative, but I have tested out ChatGPT's Agent capability to see what it can do independently.  The results have been mixed on that front...

AI: Tell me more about those mixed results with the Agent capability - what worked well and what didn't?

User: So for one task, I asked it to develop graphics for a class I am teaching about advanced Rhino-to-Revit modeling, so I told it what I wanted, and it went through the research process and developed a bunch of different graphics.  Some were good, others not so much, but I came away impressed.  Another time, I wanted it to analyze something in Notion (which had been connected by the integration) in order to generate a presentation outline, but the process kept getting hamstrung by API timeouts.  This might not have been the AI's fault, but it resulted in my needing to share public links, which I didn't really want to do for work-related data.

AI: That API timeout issue sounds frustrating, especially when you're dealing with sensitive work data and had to compromise on privacy.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at Rockwell Group embracing these tools similarly, or are you more of an early adopter?

User: I see people using AI all the time for all sorts of things.  I would say I'm definitely more on the technical output side of things, due to the nature of my work.  At my last job, it was a different story.  I was an early adopter, but there was pushback about AI use even though I had been part of a team piloting Copilot.  The efficiency boosts were just too great to ignore though.

AI: That contrast between your current and previous workplace is really interesting. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would get frustrated when I would work on developing a script, and despite many turns and iterations, it wouldn't work. I'd hop between different models and sometimes one model would find a solution where the previous one was unable to.  Sometimes, all it would take is the release of a new model to crack the problem.  That was the case when OpenAI released o1, and it was able to solve a coding issue that 4o hadn't been able to solve.

AI: That's a really specific example of how model capabilities can vary even for the same problem. It sounds like you've developed strategies for navigating those limitations by switching between models.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well I work hard to learn new skills in order to augment my skillset, but I suppose there is some fear about the potential for obsolescence.  Even though I'm in a creative industry, my role is more of a creative technical support one, but I like to think about it in a way where AI could alleviate the burdens of addressing the more common issues my coworkers face in order for my teammates and me to focus on more advanced things that the AI can't handle.  For example, my dream is to have a chatbot integrated into all of the project chats on Microsoft Teams, built on the knowledge of Revit use according to our standards, that can agentically operate and answer basic to intermediate level questions reliably, in order to elevate the really difficult matters to the human experts who have the truly nuanced knowledge.

AI: That's a really thoughtful vision - using AI to handle the routine support questions so you can focus on the complex, nuanced challenges that require human expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving over the next few years?

User: I imagine it will become more ubiquitous in the workplace as its capabilities grow, and as it becomes sophisticated, I want to see AI make me an even more productive and efficient worker.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on finding that sweet spot where your natural language strengths complement AI's technical capabilities, and your vision for using AI to handle routine support so human experts can focus on the nuanced challenges.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's all I've got too.  Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from the iterative coding process to workplace culture differences, and especially your thoughtful approach to leveraging AI as a force multiplier, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
