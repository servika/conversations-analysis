Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great. Let us begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do acting and comedy and I am involved in a lot of behind the scenes/backstage work as well in both film and theater. A typical project is a gig for me frankly. I am being brought into a team to perform a particular role because of my distinct abilities.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you work across multiple facets of the entertainment industry. I can imagine each gig brings its own unique challenges and creative demands.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I primarily engage AI tools to help me deal with administrative tasks and paperwork, filling forms when I am applying for jobs, keeping on top of my paperwork for my union membership, tailoring my resume and portfolio, managing my calendar and schedule.

AI: That's a really practical application - using AI to handle the business side so you can focus on the creative work itself. It sounds like AI is helping you manage the less glamorous but essential parts of being a working creative professional.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I recently helped to design a set for a comedy video/podcast. I had done some drawings as mock ups to show the client what it would look like, but they were unsatisfied with the work I had done. So I transferred my drawing into a AI and was able to make it into a realistic, 3d image and was able to convince the client and make some important changes. We used that image to run green-screen screen tests and give the client a chance to play in the space and see how it would look on camera before we committed to building the set.  I was frustrated at first with how the AI tool handled rendering my drawing however, the experience helped me to learn how to better prompt the model to get desired results.

AI: That's a fascinating example - it sounds like AI became a crucial communication tool between you and the client, helping bridge the gap between your creative vision and what they could visualize. 

Tell me more about that frustration you mentioned with how the AI initially handled your drawing. What was happening there, and how did you figure out how to get better results from it?

User: It is a rather specific thing, but when you mention to a model to NOT include some element, it would invariably show up. It's like dealing with humans and you tell them to not think of a pink elephant. Do you get my drift? Elements that I didn't want included, I did not even mention. Because for example I would tell it, "get rid of the bust of Shakespeare"; The bust would appear in every iteration even after explicit requests to remove it.

AI: That's such a vivid way to put it - the "pink elephant" problem! It really captures how AI seems to latch onto the very things you're trying to avoid when you mention them explicitly. 

So you learned to work around that by simply not mentioning unwanted elements at all. How did that change feel for you as a creative professional - having to adapt your communication style to work effectively with the AI tool?

User: It was kind of annoying but it is like learning to deal with any other personality. I will admit that I caution a lot of people to be careful and sparing in using AI tools because of this, often they will not get what they want at first because they have not bothered to learn how to prompt engineer and will either become frustrated or end up producing work that is "good enough" but contains other flaws or errors that they had not been paying attention to at all.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the learning curve and the potential pitfalls. It sounds like you see AI as a tool that requires skill and attention to use well, rather than something that just automatically produces good results.

When you caution people about using AI tools, what kinds of flaws or errors do you typically see them miss when they settle for "good enough" work?

User: "short attention span errors" for example, you generate an image of a waiting room with potted plants. the issue is that they are not real plants and only bear passing resemblance to real potted plants but you'd only notice if you're looking for more than a split second. A lot of people in Comedy generate posters for shows using AI tools to avoid dealing with graphics software like Photoshop or Gimp, but also create posters where the comedian doesn't look anything like their avatar, they have a double headed mic or extra fingers. It look good enough to the user because they had some ideas about what they wanted to see but neglect details that the end user (the people they are trying to convince to come to their show) will see and judge them on. I am sure you know there is a virulent anti AI sentiment in a lot of the creative world.

AI: That's really telling - those "short attention span errors" you describe paint a clear picture of how AI output can look convincing at first glance but fall apart under closer inspection. And I can see how that connects to the broader tension you mention about anti-AI sentiment in creative fields.

When you're working with AI tools yourself, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in your process?

User: I use AI primarily to do the "boring stuff" or use it as a "sounding board". I very rarely ever use AI to generate unique ideas or concepts. Rather I prefer to use it to tell my ideas to and to try to identify gaps or inconsistencies in my own work, as a third person perspective to look at my own output from a different angle.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as more of a critical thinking partner rather than an idea generator. It sounds like you've found a way to maintain your creative agency while leveraging AI's ability to offer that outside perspective.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: The amount of people who do not know anything about AI except that it is the new hot thing and they want to use it to make their projects stand out. This is not a wrong or bad instinct per se but it has made me think about what the true best use case for AI in creative fields is. Because for science and mathematics, it is straightforward: sometimes there are problems so complex that this amount of computing power and linguistic sophistication is the solution to overcoming human limitations. For arts it is the opposite: how do we use this tool to maximize human potential rather than suppressing it

AI: That's a profound distinction you're making - using AI to overcome human limitations in technical fields versus maximizing human potential in creative fields. That seems to get at the heart of a lot of the tension around AI in creative work.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am afraid it will be used by unscrupulous parties (especially executives) to cut corners, cheat workers and de-value traditional film-making techniques and skills.  Movies and the theater and music are businesses after all, and maximizing profits is still the name of the game.

AI: That's a very grounded concern - the economic pressures in entertainment are real, and AI could easily become a tool for cost-cutting rather than creative enhancement. It sounds like you're seeing this tension between AI as a creative collaborator versus AI as a way to replace skilled workers.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think that AI generated mass entertainment will proliferate, somewhat like the cheap pulp novels and paperbacks from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A segment of the population will enjoy these and another will see it as an undesirable symptom of modernity. There will be at least one film or album with an "AI" actor or musician that will provoke very heated debate about the nature of art. I also think that there will be both a renaissance of traditional film making (painted scenery and sets , practical effects, etc) as well as a boom of independent creators using AI tools to bring their worlds to life who otherwise would have never had the opportunity. I think there will be strict regulations placed upon AI use in creative fields because of the strength of the Hollywood/Broadway/entertainment lobby.

AI: That's such a nuanced vision - you're seeing multiple parallel tracks emerging rather than just one direction. The comparison to pulp novels is really apt - suggesting AI entertainment might find its own market niche while traditional craftsmanship potentially gains renewed appreciation.

Before we wrap up, those are all the questions I had prepared, and you've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to maximize rather than suppress human potential, and your practical wisdom about the importance of really learning how to work with these tools effectively.

Is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that about does it. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of working with AI tools - from the "pink elephant" prompting challenges to your thoughtful approach of using AI as a creative sounding board rather than an idea generator - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated hearing your perspective on how to navigate AI as a tool that requires skill and attention, and your vision for how the creative landscape might evolve with both AI-generated content and a renaissance of traditional techniques coexisting. 

Thanks again, and best of luck with your upcoming projects!
