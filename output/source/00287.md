Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I definitely don't use AI everyday. But some of the tasks I use it for are helping draft emails in sensitive situations. I deal with customers daily, and occasionally I use AI to help with phrasing specific emails that might let a customer down or how to professionally respond to upset customers. I am also responsible for my company's social media account. I use AI to help draft posts and come up with ideas for popular and engaging post topics.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned you don't use AI every day. When those sensitive customer situations or social media needs do come up, what draws you to reach for AI specifically for help with the phrasing and messaging?

User: I don't have creative intuition, so I know that AI cuts down on the time I would normally spend trying to come up with ideas or how to appropriately phrase things.

AI: Tell me more about that - what does that process look like when you're working on something like a difficult customer email? How do you typically interact with the AI to get to the final version you send?

User: I would give the chatbot a summary of the important information, such as what has been previously discussed and what led to the situation. Then I would provide the straightforward information that I need to convey and ask the chatbot to phrase it professionally and appropriately. Usually, there is a bit of back and forth to tailor the message or clear up a chatbot misunderstanding. Or I'll take the first draft the AI offers, and make any minor edits myself.

AI: That back-and-forth process you described sounds pretty collaborative. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I'm sure there are a lot of tasks that I handle myself that AI could help with. But for me, it's really only the creative things that I need help with. I also prefer that in the general back-and-forth with customers that it doesn't sound as robotic as AI makes it seem sometimes. Any of the analytical tasks or tasks that require attention to detail I am more comfortable completing myself, as that is just what comes natural to me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're leveraging AI where it complements your strengths rather than replacing them. When you do use AI for those creative tasks like emails or social media posts, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach using these tools?

User: There really hasn't been any influence from my workplace culture or my colleagues. For the most part, it's recognized that specific tasks are under my domain, and I'm left to my own devices to tackle them as need be. I am also in a management position, so it's really not up to any of my colleagues to determine how I complete my tasks.

AI: That autonomy sounds like it gives you the freedom to experiment and find what works best for you. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't think of a specific time, but there certainly have been times where I've expressed to the chatbot what it is that I'd like said or done, and it just couldn't grasp what I was asking. There would be multiple conversation turns where I'd have to clarify or ask for an edit and the output just wasn't what I was trying to relay.

AI: What happens in those moments when the AI isn't grasping what you're trying to convey? Do you keep pushing through with it, or do you switch approaches entirely?

User: I occasionally switch the approach or phrasing in how I'm asking the AI to respond. But if it's been multiple attempts and it's just not getting it, I'll give up. In those cases, I'll take whatever output was closest to what I was looking for and tailor/edit it myself to what I needed. There have been rare cases where I've started entirely from scratch in a new conversation and for whatever reason, the request might click that time.

AI: That's really helpful to understand your persistence and backup strategies. As you think about the work you do - especially those analytical tasks and detail-oriented work that you mentioned comes naturally to you - how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's not really something I consider. I believe it will be a long way off for AI to take over in my particular industry. There are aspects of my industry that AI just can't do (think water!)

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like the physical nature of your industry provides a natural boundary. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different tasks as the technology develops?

User: I could see the potential for AI use in different tasks, but ultimately, the technology would have to come a long way before I could see that. Despite the persistence of human error in certain tasks, I still trust my judgement and ability to double-check everything over the automation of AI. Tasks like scheduling and payroll require the advanced reasoning that I don't think AI has quite mastered yet.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI specifically for creative tasks where it complements your natural analytical strengths, and your practical approach to the back-and-forth process when the AI doesn't quite grasp what you need.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I know that the process is underway, but I do think it would be valuable in the tasks that I use AI for, to have more up-to-date and current events capabilities in AI. For something like social media, especially, it's incredibly valuable to know what type of content, topics, or hashtags are popular in the moment to maintain relevance.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the timeliness factor for social media work makes complete sense. The need to tap into current trends and what's happening right now is such a crucial part of creating relevant content.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI for creative tasks while maintaining control over analytical work, and especially that point about real-time information needs, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
