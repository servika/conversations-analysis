Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a generalist creative, so I do photography, photoshop/compositing, art direction, graphic design etc.

AI: That's a really diverse skill set! With all those different creative disciplines you work in, I'm curious - walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: AI has been most useful in handling my admin tasks, like keeping track of client info, responding to emails etc. I use Photoshops AI denoise, and occasionally Generative Fill in my photography work. I've also used Firefly and Stable Diffusion to iterate on initial concepts for illustration jobs.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you on both the administrative side and the creative side. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: For the above illustration project, I had to produce a large suite of variations of a basic design. AI allowed me to easily and quickly iterate on my base illustration into a multitude of new versions. It worked well for this particular project.

AI: Tell me more about that process of iterating with AI on your base illustration. How did you work with the AI to create those variations - what was that back and forth like?

User: I completed my base illustration by using a hand drawn image that was modified in Firefly, iterated on, then redrawn again by hand. Next, this finalised base illustration was turned into many aesthetic variations in Stable Diffusion

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - going from hand-drawn to AI iteration, back to hand-drawn, and then using AI again for variations. When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions throughout that process?

User: Even when using something like Stable Diffusion (i.e. a tool that "gives a lot of  control," using AI feels like a bit of a crapshoot. I understand what I want my final image to look like, but it's difficult to "art direct" the various models. I've experienced similar things using Suno.AI: regardless of the prompt, a lot of the final output seems to be heavily dependant on a random seed. In the future, I'd love to better be able to direct these models so there's less "randomness" involved in the creation process

AI: That's really insightful - the tension between having a clear vision and the unpredictability of the output. You mentioned wanting to better "art direct" the models in the future. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has this randomness factor affected how you approach projects or your creative process more broadly?

User: Not really, if anything, for genuinely creative work, AI feels like an impediment of sorts. At the moment, its only truly useful if there's no budget for hiring a human illustrator. However, using  LLMs has been tremendously helpful in taking the stress out of various admin-related aspects of  creative work (analysing analytics, helping with client comms etc.)

AI: That's a really honest perspective - AI as helpful for admin but potentially an impediment for the genuinely creative aspects. You touched on budget considerations there. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My main income source in creative work is photography-based. I don't see photography as immediately being as negatively affected by AI as much as illustration, music production, writing etc. I also think "fine art" in general is sort of immune to being damaged by AI. I don't believe there's any sense in being a luddite in day-to-day commercial work. Although I "get where people are coming from" when they're mad that people are using AI for illustration work, realistically, the people using AI tools would not have paid for a human artist anyway. I do feel for established illustrators who have had their distinctive style "ripped" by AI models.

AI: You've raised some really nuanced points there - the distinction between different creative fields' vulnerability to AI, and the economic realities versus the style appropriation concerns. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I look forward to Photoshop's integrated AI tools improving. At the moment, it's clearly early days, but they're getting really good. I think they're already extremely useful for doing cutouts etc. (the sort of work that would usually be very time-consuming or offshored to cheap labor) and Generative Fill is decent, but will be amazing very shortly. I most look forward to AI getting better at helping me with the admin stuff I mentioned earlier, though.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI being more of an impediment for genuinely creative work right now, while being genuinely helpful for admin tasks and certain technical aspects like cutouts in Photoshop.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nah, I think that's all. Thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the different ways AI impacts various creative disciplines, the challenges with directing AI models, and that honest distinction between where AI helps versus hinders your creative process - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
