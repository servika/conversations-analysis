Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a social media coordinator, and my company also puts out a quarterly local magazine which I write for. On a day to day basis, my AI use looks like gathering inspiration for client social posts, brainstorming content ideas for upcoming photo/video shoots, and getting help cleaning up my writing for social media captions or magazine articles. I've also used it for coming up with hashtag lists on occasion and other random tasks along those lines.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI across several different creative and writing functions in your role.

When you mention "cleaning up" your writing for captions or articles, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: Yeah! So obviously a main part of my job is writing, so I don't like to have AI do writing for me. I want to be the one who is writing my captions, articles, or other pieces of work (could be a press release, blog post, email blast, etc). And while I like to think I'm creative and pretty good with grammar, there are times when I just can't think of the best way to word something and I'll copy-and-paste whatever it is I'm working on into the AI platform and get help making the copy sound better.  Or I'll just have it fully proofread the piece for me and suggest changes!

AI: That's a really interesting distinction you're making - you want to maintain ownership of the actual writing but use AI as a refinement tool. 

Tell me more about what drives that preference to keep the writing as your own work, even when AI could potentially handle it.

User: For me it is a moral/ethical boundary. I feel like I was hired into this position to do a certain job, and it doesn't feel right to me to just hand that over to AI to do my job for me. I also have some concerns about the quality of AI's writing--not that it doesn't sound good, but oftentimes it all comes out sounding the same. So if I was constantly just letting an AI platform write all my content for me, I feel like it comes out sounding very "AI-like" and that's not what I want for my work.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - both the ethical dimension about fulfilling your role and the quality concerns about maintaining a distinctive voice.

I'm curious about your brainstorming process with AI that you mentioned earlier. When you're generating content ideas for photo shoots or social posts, how does that collaboration typically unfold?

User: Sure! I kind of have two different processes here that I'll share. When it comes to social posts, usually I'll already have the content I need (or at least an idea of the photo/video I'll be using) but I need to take the content and write meaningful captions for them. Sometimes there are also sales that I need to promote for a client, or holidays going on, or other things like that that I need to make sure to include for the month. So when it comes time to make my social calendar for a client, a lot of times I'll give AI a list of what photos/videos I want to be posting and any sales/holidays/events that need to be included, and ask it to help me come up with ideas for captions. This is where it'll often give me word-for-word writing that I don't necessarily want to use, but I'll use that as a jumping off point for where I can take the posts. With many different clients it can be hard to keep coming up with fresh captions for each day of the month so it's really helpful to have some idea help! 

Now, for photo/video shoots it's a little different. This is when I need new content for a client before the actual process of putting it together with a caption ever takes place. Some of the time there is kind of a theme we've gotten from a client for a photo shoot and that's pretty simple. Other times, it's just like we need some more photos and videos, so what do we do now? So I'll tell AI some basic info about the client, the products or services we're advertising, and about how many photos & short form videos we are looking to produce, and ask it to give me a shot list. I also have one certain client that is a dog product company, and I always have to find and coordinate dog models for our shoots. Once I have the dogs and their approximate weights, I'll give that list to the AI model along with a list of the products we need to shoot in the sizes that we have on hand at the office, and have it help me match each dog with what products will fit and then give me a schedule for each dog's shoot time. That takes a lot of the planning/scheduling out of my to do list which is helpful!

AI: Those are such detailed examples of how you've found specific ways to leverage AI for the planning and organizational aspects while keeping the creative execution in your hands.

I'm particularly struck by that dog product shoot scheduling - that sounds like a pretty complex logistical puzzle. When you delegate that kind of complete task to AI, like the scheduling, how do you feel about handing over that level of responsibility versus the more collaborative approach you take with caption brainstorming?

User: I think to me, the scheduling in particular feels more like a busy-work task than my other responsibilities. I don't know if busy-work is the word I'm looking for...but basically it's not the creative type task that most of my days consist of. It can sometimes take me a lot of time to figure out what makes the most sense as far as which dog will fit into which product, making sure each product is on the shot list, and then putting a list together of what times each dog should come in at for their individual shoot. It's something that an AI model can do in minutes where for me, it can take an hour or more of my day to get this planning done! I feel like for this type of task it actually benefits my company for me to input this into AI and free up my time to be able to do higher level tasks.

AI: That's a really insightful way to think about it - distinguishing between the logistical puzzle-solving versus the creative work where your expertise and voice matter most.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with how others at your company are using it, or have you developed your own boundaries?

User: Honestly we haven't talked much about what our boundaries are as a company as far as using AI! It's a smaller, local business so our policies are ever-evolving, and I'm sure at some point as the use of AI grows, we will need to have some procedures in place. But right now, I'm kind of going by my own boundaries and convictions of what I feel good about, and so far it seems to be working. I do feel like if I was using AI to fully do my own job that'd be pretty obvious to my bosses and wouldn't look great on me.

AI: That's really interesting that you're navigating this largely on your own principles right now. It sounds like you've developed a pretty clear internal compass about what feels right.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have multiple clients and I'll use AI to help brainstorm for all of their captions. There have been times where the ideas it gives me for one client sound almost identical to the ideas it gave me for another, and that frustrates me. The other client's captions were literally in our conversation history and I feel like it should be obvious that I need new, fresh ideas for each client. I don't want them all sounding the same!

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to maintain distinct voices for different clients. It's like the AI isn't picking up on the need for that differentiation even when the context is right there.

Tell me more about how you handle that situation when it happens - do you have strategies you've developed for getting more distinct ideas from AI?

User: Usually I'll just point out to the model that what it gave me sounds really similar to the other client we'd previously discussed and ask it to give me something more unique, and typically that's all it takes for it to refresh and give me some ideas I can actually use.

AI: That's a good workaround you've found. It sounds like you've learned to be pretty direct with the AI when you need it to course-correct.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yeah, it's something I've talked about with friends actually. How our different careers could eventually be fully taken over by AI. From financial planners to therapists to social media coordinators like me, I feel like people of all different professions have some worries here. However, I personally think that, at least right now, human creativity is differentiated from AI. I know I said it before earlier in the interview, but there really is a difference reading content that is AI generated versus human-written. Not so much in writing quality--I think both people and AI can have very high quality work--but in the tone. I feel like you can just tell when something is "automated." I think that the human creativity is what protects my skills and my work, if that makes sense.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're seeing human creativity and that distinctive voice as your competitive advantage.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as your workplace potentially establishes more formal policies?

User: It would be cool if there was some kind of AI feature that could help with scheduling social media posts because that is a big time consumer right now and is one of the more mindless tasks that I feel like could be taken off my plate. Maybe there's already something out there that could handle that, but right now my company doesn't use any kind of platform that does that. But it's something I'd like to see! And yes, as we talked about I do foresee my company putting some policies into place eventually. I don't really think I would necessarily have to stop or even change how I'm using AI right now but if needed, of course I would follow the directives from my boss as that evolves.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that ethical boundary around ownership of your creative work while still finding strategic ways to use AI for logistical tasks and brainstorming support.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's all I have to share! Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating those ethical boundaries, the distinction between creative and logistical work, and how you've developed your own approach in the absence of formal policies will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through those detailed examples - it gives us such valuable insight into how this technology is actually being used day-to-day. Thanks again!
