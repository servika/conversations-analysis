Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Yes.  I am a busy attorney with a large caseload.  I often use AI to draft simple responses to clients. I also use AI after I have finished drafting a motion for feedback.  AI definitely isnt good enough to write the motion, and often hallucinates case law, but it is excellent (after redacting clients names) to ask what is our strongest and weakest points. I also ask it for areas of improvement.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found specific niches where AI adds value while being clear about its limitations. 

Tell me more about that feedback process after you've drafted a motion. What does that interaction typically look like - are you having a back-and-forth conversation with the AI about your arguments, or is it more like getting a single review and moving on?

User: I am often having a back and forth conversation.  If I input the applicable case law and legal standard, AI is good for providing feedback based on that.  I also sometimes ask it to take my written motion and develop an outline for oral argument or ask it to anticipate counter arguments from opposing counsel.

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative approach. You're essentially using the AI as a thinking partner once you've established the legal foundation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that AI isn't good enough to write the motion itself - are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to write all my own motions because AI is not integrated into Lexis or Westlaw to do legal research.  I also prefer to write my own emails to clients if it includes legal advice since its my bar card on the line.

AI: That makes complete sense - you're drawing clear lines around tasks that carry professional liability or require specialized research tools.

When you do use AI for those tasks you mentioned - like drafting simple client responses or getting feedback on motions - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach using AI in your work?

User: Well, Outlook has AI integrated but the legal profession is very archaic. Lawyers dont retire. So there is definitely a generational divide. Younger attorneys embrace it more.  I also note that clients use it a lot for draft letters that they write the court especially if they have to address the court. I can always tell when its AI.

AI: That's a fascinating observation about being able to spot AI-generated client letters to the court. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI is very frustrating when it hallucinates case law or a quote from a case/statute that isnt there or was present in a prior version of a statute.  You really have to double check because it wont know, and even if you ask it whether it is real or not, it will often say it is real.

AI: That sounds like a really challenging aspect of working with AI - having to be constantly vigilant about verification, especially when the AI seems confident about inaccurate information.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I think about it in terms of job security all the time.

AI: Tell me more about that. What goes through your mind when you're thinking about job security in relation to AI?

User: I think that AI is going to decrease people's reliance on lawyers once people understand how to write the correct prompts. Especially, low income persons who rely on lawyers because they don't understand the law.  A lot of things that people hire lawyers for in their individual capacity, they can truly do themselves.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on how AI might democratize access to legal information, especially for people who previously couldn't afford legal help.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see yourself with these tools in the coming years?

User: I see myself as somsone who is hopefully training low income persons on how to best utilize AI because I can also envision someone submitting a motion full of hallucinated citations.  If you don't know any better, you wouldn't know they arent real.

AI: That's really compelling - you're envisioning a role where you'd help bridge that gap between AI capabilities and legal literacy to prevent exactly those kinds of problems you mentioned.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the generational divide in the legal profession and your vision for helping others use AI safely in legal contexts.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in legal work - especially around the verification challenges and the potential for democratizing legal access - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
