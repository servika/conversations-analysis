Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my workday as a software engineer, I might use AI for research, troubleshooting errors, building custom components, making quick adjustments to code blocks, or helping to write more concise, professional documentation. For example, if I encounter an error I've never seen before, I will provide the error message, any relevant contextual information (language, libraries, etc) and then the code block that is rendering the error. Another example of use would be when handling customer support. I will draft an initial reply to the user that may be a few paragraphs of explanation and reasoning. Then I will have AI rewrite the reply to be more professional and empathetic and to stay within certain constraints (ie. not promising anything).

AI: That's really helpful - I can see AI is woven into several different parts of your work. You mentioned using it for troubleshooting errors you've never seen before. 

Tell me more about that process. When you hit that kind of error, what makes you decide to turn to AI versus other resources like documentation or Stack Overflow?

User: I've found in my 10 years of coding that I waste a lot of time searching with web searches and end up clicking into multiple stackoverflow threads to find that they don't contain an answer, aren't relevant, or are unanswered. AI, while sometimes not fully correct, gets me to the solution faster, asks me relevant questions to reach the solution, and explains clearly what is happening and how to fix it. I've had a higher success rate in fixing my bugs through utilizing AI over trying to find documentation or random blog or forum threads that can answer the question.

AI: That's fascinating - you've essentially shifted from a hunting-and-gathering approach to having a conversation with AI about the problem. The interactive aspect sounds particularly valuable.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: In honesty, the only limitations of AI in my tasks is when it needs to be done manually by me or AI is not built in or usable within the context. For example, I write FileMaker applications as my primary role at my company and while they've started allowing AI to be integrated into our solutions, its more of as an API and we have no access to utilize AI in our coding workspaces. The only time I use AI for FileMaker development is to build out small calculations or code refinement by copy-pasting. Because of the IDE and interface that FileMaker uses for development, it is not time efficient to utilize AI for much more than that and it is better that I do the work in the old fashioned hands-on way.

AI: That's really interesting - so it's less about conceptual preferences and more about practical constraints. The FileMaker environment creates friction that makes AI less efficient than just doing the work directly.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: This depends on the circumstance. When it comes to working on bug fixes, refactoring, and troubleshooting, my collaboration is more of a collaboration effort. When approaching a task that is more of research, concepting, and designing I will usually delegate the design work to the AI with minimal input as I am relying on it's knowledgebase to provide me something modern and innovative.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially matching your interaction style to the nature of the task. For technical problem-solving you want that back-and-forth, but for research and design you're tapping into AI's broad knowledge base.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace culture has been progressive in adopting AI into their workflows, though no formal instruction or guidance has been shared or discussed encouraging users to implement AI into their work. In terms of Research and Development, other teams have started integrating AI into their products to add enhanced features that could not be done by normal programming. Knowing that my colleagues are also using AI to solve some of their own problems or to enhance their work encourages me to do the same.

AI: So it sounds like there's an organic adoption happening across teams, even without official guidance. That peer influence seems to create a supportive environment for experimentation.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was a situation working with ChatGPT and Gemini one  time to try and resolve a list of errors I was getting within a react project. I ended up going through maybe a dozen different code changes and multiple conversations and both AI models were making suggestions off of outdated code practices and functions. Ultimately, I had to do my own research and consult documentation and found that within the last year, the newer version of React and Node had introduced changes to their framework and certain functions which the AI kept suggesting as a fix were deprecated. To be fair, this was at least 6 months to a year ago so AI wasn't as widely adopted and updated to the standard it is today and it was more prone to making errors. Another frustration I have is when the AI model forgets instructions that I clearly had in my conversation. ChatGPT does this still today. I'll instruct to not include em-dashes or smart quotes in any of its responses or content creation and after a few rounds of conversation, it will revert to using em-dashes and/or smart quotes.

AI: Those are really concrete examples of friction points. The outdated information issue is particularly interesting - it sounds like you've learned to be more cautious about AI suggestions when working with rapidly evolving technologies.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: When it comes to the possibility that AI can take over certain roles and tasks in the software field, I think that human interaction is still going to be required to ensure that the resulting code is usable, completely functional, and secure. While we already see AI being able to generate functional code, a human still needs to review the code to ensure it won't break a larger ecosystem of applications/services if it is put into the code base and to make sure that it doesn't reveal any security issues. In working with larger solutions that are quite complex, I don't think we will see AI overtake the requirement for a human to be involved.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you see AI as augmenting rather than replacing the human role, especially when it comes to integration and security considerations in complex systems.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As I move my work more into development of web applications with languages like React and C#, I'll be moving away from using FileMaker as my code IDE and to something more industry adopting like Visual Studio Code. This will allow me access to AI extensions like Gemini Code to utilize AI directly in my code. I'll most likely be continuing to adopt AI in my development so that I output results faster and continue to innovate and write better code.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you adapt your collaboration style based on the task type - using AI as a conversational partner for debugging but delegating more completely for research and design work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It was really valuable to hear about both the practical constraints you face and how you've learned to work around AI's limitations while leveraging its strengths.

Have a great rest of your day!
