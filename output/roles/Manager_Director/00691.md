Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use AI to draft up emails and correspondence with my work's customers. We are a small engineering services company, and we work with a lot of government contractors, so it's really important for us to say the right thing to them and word things in a specific way. I use AI to help me come up with ways to write these correspondences, and I even have AI help me with wording for different policies and initiatives that we implement at work for our employees but also things like our ISO 9001:2015 certifications.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like the precision and tone of your communications are crucial in your line of work. 

When you're working on these customer correspondences or policy documents, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you start with a rough draft yourself, or do you begin by explaining the situation to the AI and having it create the initial version?

User: I like to explain the situation to the AI and have it create the initial version. From there, I can have the AI tweak it, or I'll just tweak it manually myself.

AI: That makes sense - starting with AI gives you that foundation to build from. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When working on a time crunch, especially if I need to send things out immediately, I generally handle those tasks by myself, just because I don't have time to log into my AI account and ask it to write things and then tweak it from there- AI isn't integrated with the platforms we use (or at least, my company hasn't paid for integrated versions). If I have more time, I like to have AI do them for me. So really, it's a time thing. Another reason I would handle a task myself is if I have a personal relationship with a company, and I know specifically who I'm dealing with. I like to handle those type of tasks myself.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the time factor and the personal relationship element both seem to influence when you choose to go it alone.

When you mentioned having a personal relationship with a company and knowing specifically who you're dealing with, can you tell me more about that? What is it about those situations that makes you want to handle the communication yourself?

User: Often times, I have a rapport with these individiuals. For example, with one company specifically, I have become "work friends" of sorts with the contract administrator. Working with this company is SUPER time consuming, and I often have to write emails to this individual and be on the phone with them. I think speaking on the phone with them while also having to write emails to them and copying other people in the company just makes it easier for me to handle this company's business on my own, rather than delegating it to AI. Also, it's pretty rare in our industry to have this type of relationship, so it's nice to have that human, personal touch in our correspondences.

AI: That really paints a clear picture - it sounds like that personal connection you've built is both professionally valuable and something you want to preserve through your own voice in the communications.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? You mentioned starting with AI creating the initial version and then tweaking from there - are you more likely to go back and forth with the AI to refine things, or do you usually take that first draft and make your changes manually?

User: I actually normally have AI refine things once or twice, and then if AI isn't getting what I want correct, I'll go in and make changes manually.

AI: That's a helpful way to think about it - giving the AI a couple of chances to get it right before you step in to finish it yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other people at your company using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently than others?

User: We are a super small company- there's about five of us in total. There are only two of us in my position of account manager and compliance coordinator- and I'm the only one who uses AI in my workflow. I think there's a fear of AI with the other employees.

AI: That's fascinating - being the only one using AI in such a small team puts you in a unique position. 

When you say there's a fear of AI with the other employees, what do you think that fear stems from? Have you had any conversations with them about it, or is it more something you've observed?

User: The news, as with everything else, makes people fearful of new things. Specifically with AI, I think the media can often paint a picture that AI is taking over and it's eliminating jobs... it creates a fear. Which I totally understand! I think age is a big factor too. Three of the other employees are older, so newer technologies are much more difficult to adopt and embrace.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the media narrative around AI can definitely create anxiety, especially when combined with the natural hesitation that can come with adopting new technologies.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time my boss needed to draft an email to a customer trying to get insight as to why a certain job didn't work out the way it needed to, but he didn't know how to word it. I used AI to create a draft on how to word this email to this customer who was a higher-up at a major government contractor, and it gave me the perfect blueprint on the perfect email for this person. I had to manually fill in details after the AI created the draft due to our NDA with this company, but it was the perfect email, and helped us get out of a sticky situation.

AI: That sounds like a really valuable win - especially when dealing with such a high-stakes situation and an important client relationship.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would definitely like to continue growing my skills in how I use AI in my work. I feel like I'm still learning how I can implement AI into my work... and there are some things I absolutely cannot use AI for, mainly due to very ironclad NDAs we have with certain companies. But I would love to continue learning AI skills to help streamline my work.

AI: That's a great perspective - viewing AI skills themselves as something to develop while being mindful of those boundaries like NDAs.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different types of tasks as time goes on?

User: I think learning to delegate tasks to AI will be the next big thing for me- like having it create spreadsheets for me and coming up with presentations for me. I've experimented with these tasks before, but the AI created clunky looking spreadsheets and presentations, but this was a while ago. I need to continue experimenting, especially as AI continues to evolve.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how personal relationships influence when you choose to handle tasks yourself, and how you're pioneering AI use in your small company despite others' hesitations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in a small company environment, balancing efficiency with personal relationships, and being the early adopter among colleagues will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
