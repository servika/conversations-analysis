Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI is very helpful for me during my workday.  I work as a bookkeeper and an accountant and I use AI in many different ways.  I use it as it is integrated into software such as Quickbooks where it helps me more quickly sort through bank transactions and categorize them correctly.  I also use ChatGPT to help me write client letters, organize data, create charts from data, as well as write letters to governing agencies such as the IRS or the state.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses. It sounds like AI is touching multiple aspects of your accounting work, from the technical categorization side to client communication.

When you mention using ChatGPT to write letters to agencies like the IRS or state offices, could you tell me more about that process? How do you typically work with it on those kinds of formal communications?

User: I usually tell ChatGPT what my goal is in the letter and let it do its thing.  For example I might say I need to write a letter to the IRS in response to a letter my client received from them.  The IRS claim is that my client did not file their 2022 tax return.  I need this letter to explain that my client did file their 2022 tax return on time and I have included the e-file confirmation receipt as proof.  ChatGPT will then use those facts to produce a letter I can fill in name info, address information etc that looks professional and is ready to send.

AI: That's a very clear example of how you delegate a complete task to ChatGPT. You give it the context and objective, and it produces a finished letter that you then customize.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your accounting work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Sometimes I prefer to handle anything with sensitive data especially if it might connect client names or data with social security numbers.  I worry about the long term security of AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the sensitivity around client data and social security numbers is a significant consideration.

When you do use AI for work tasks, I'm curious about your typical interaction pattern. You mentioned giving ChatGPT the context for IRS letters and letting it produce the full letter. Is that generally how you work with AI - giving it complete tasks to handle - or are there times when you collaborate with it more back-and-forth throughout a task?

User: Sometimes if I am working on a longer project. Especially if  I am using AI to formulate a plan or data analysis there will be a good bit of back and forth regarding changes or updates I want to make along the way.  I also have used ChatGPT for ways to explain a difficult tax situation or tax laws to clients and that will often create a back and forth collaboration as I am able to give ChatGPT a specific example to help me explain.

AI: That's really interesting - so it sounds like the complexity and nature of the task influences whether you delegate completely or collaborate. The tax explanation work with specific client examples seems like a particularly collaborative process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your field embracing it similarly, or have you encountered different approaches?

User: I think that AI is being embraced as a whole in the accounting industry.  I see many firms using AI to help them complete tax returns and bookkeeping software in general has begun to include a lot of AI assistance.

AI: It sounds like there's a broader industry shift happening with AI adoption across accounting.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: As one of my many roles I do some light property management for one of my clients and they needed a long term reserve study done for their homeowners association board.  They wanted to look at what the next 10 years might look like for the community while acknowledging the needs of financial stability and necessary repairs and maintenance.  I was able to provide ChatGPT with the current monthly HOA fees, the current needs in order of importance, and the goals of the organization.  ChatGPT was able to produce a really great and helpful reserve study that went into great detail about average cost of the mentioned maintenance and repair issues, a long term 10 year plan for when they should be done, it gave me charts that explained the increases and decreases and when special reserve funds should be collected from the community, as well as a letter to give to residents on why dues would be increasing, how much, and what to expect in the next few years.  It was truly helpful and saved me hours of manual work.

AI: That sounds like a remarkably comprehensive deliverable that would have taken you considerable time to research and create manually. The fact that it produced the reserve study, charts, timeline, and even the resident communication letter as a complete package is impressive.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your work?

User: I think that it is important for me to maintain knowledge and overall comprehensive understanding of these topics because I will be responsible for explaining them as well as making sure that AI has given the correct answer but as far as forcing myself to continue the physical skill of crafting these types of documents or data entry tasks I don't think it's necessary.  I don't think that it will lessen my skills or ability to be a good accountant or bookkeeper.  It allows me more client face time and interaction.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - distinguishing between maintaining your professional knowledge and judgment versus the manual execution of documents and data entry. The point about gaining more client face time is particularly interesting.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally or for the accounting field more broadly?

User: I think we will begin to use AI more and more both personally in my job and in the field as a whole.  I think accounting as a field has a risk of becoming obsolete due to AI so I think it is important to learn to integrate it while figuring out what we can bring to the table that AI can not.

AI: That's a really candid reflection on both the opportunities and challenges AI presents for your profession. The idea of figuring out what unique value accountants can bring that AI cannot is particularly thought-provoking.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining professional knowledge while letting AI handle the manual execution, and how that creates more time for client interaction.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I also work as an educational tutor and have found that AI is very helpful in that role as well.  I have used it for lesson plans, general information, and quiz formation as well as coloring pages for younger students.  I appreciate its role in saving me time and money on resources.

AI: That's a great addition - it sounds like AI is proving valuable across both of your professional roles, from accounting to tutoring. The variety of outputs you mentioned for tutoring, from lesson plans to coloring pages, really shows the versatility.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about integrating AI while maintaining your professional expertise, the security considerations with sensitive data, and how AI is reshaping both accounting and education will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and thank you again for contributing to our research. Your perspectives were really valuable.
