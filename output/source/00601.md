Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: One of the main things I use it for is improving article titles. My workplace has a built-in tool that generates potential AI titles for existing articles. I'm required to use this as part of my job. 

I also have access to a ChatGPT subscription through my employer. I frequently use this to try to get better titles since I find it to be more effective than my employer's in-house tool and also use it to generate H2s according to the guidance provided by my employer. Sometimes I ask it to do light editing of text, but this is via a Custom GPT that I created because I find that ChatGPT on its own edits too heavily and has a tendency to add text, which I don't want it to do.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned that you find ChatGPT more effective than your employer's in-house tool for titles. What makes ChatGPT work better for you in that specific task?

User: The in-house tool that my employer uses often generates titles that don't accurately describe the article. For example, if it's generating a title for a list of Batman comics, it may generate titles that focus entirely on one list entry instead of titles that are appropriate for a list. What I want a tool like this to do is tweak existing titles to make them better for SEO and Google Discover, which ChatGPT is able to do with the proper instructions. I've fed ChatGPT all of my employer's guidance on titling articles.

AI: That sounds like a pretty significant difference in understanding what you actually need. When you say you've fed ChatGPT all of your employer's guidance on titling articles, can you walk me through how you set that up to work the way you want it to?

User: My employer sent out an email to all employees with current guidance on titling based on Google standards. Normally, I create GPTs for specific tasks like this, but since this was in-house information I didn't want to share it. I selected New Project on ChatGPT and copy-pasted my employer's instructions along with additional guidance on what I wanted it to do; i.e. prioritize titles that are in-line with what's currently performing well in searches and on Google Discover.

AI: That makes sense about keeping the in-house information private. When you're working with ChatGPT on these titles, how does that process typically unfold? Are you going back and forth with it refining the options, or do you usually get what you need on the first try?

User: It depends. I can give you some examples from recent conversations if that would be helpful!

AI: Yes, that would be really helpful! Please share whatever examples feel comfortable for you.

User: Earlier today I asked it to come up with a new title for our site's version of an existing news story. My prompt was "new version of this title from another site please: Nintendo wins $2 Million settlement against Switch modchip seller who previously denied wrongdoing," and it was able to generate reasonable suggestions on the first try. 

A recent instruction that it struggle with was "make this a better h2 for seo reasons What's The Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Card Controversy." The first batch of titles were extremely formal and weren't appropriate for H2 tags. I asked it to make them more casual and in the style of my employer, but the second round were still overly formal. I instructed it to make the suggestions more casual again, but still wasn't happy with the results and wound up coming up with options myself. 

In that case, the existing H2 contained valuable keywords but was somewhat bland; ChatGPT didn't seem to be able to offer any alternatives that weren't a more formal version of the existing text. It also created suggestions that didn't match the provided keyword, like "Do Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Cards Hurt Preservation?" and "Switch 2 Game-Key Cards 101: Pros and Cons."

AI: That's a really interesting contrast between the two examples. It sounds like the first task - creating a new version of an existing title - was more straightforward, while the H2 task required more nuanced understanding of your site's voice and SEO needs. When ChatGPT struggled with matching your employer's style, what was missing from those overly formal suggestions it kept giving you?

User: What I really wanted was something that kept the keyword from the original H2, "Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Card Controversy," but had more personality.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping the SEO keyword intact while adding that personality your site needs. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I generally handle the majority of editing myself unless the text is really clunky and hard to parse. Even with strict instructions, the AI frequently edits too heavily, fails to follow instructions not to add things or not use em dashes, and just doesn't make improvements for flow. As an example, ChatGPT might not change "pants of Batman" to "Batman's pants" even though that's an obvious improvement in readability.

AI: That's a great example with "pants of Batman" versus "Batman's pants" - it really shows how AI can miss those natural flow improvements that seem obvious to a human editor. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I work collaboratively, but don't always follow up if I'm satisfied with the results on the first try. Most of the tasks I would prefer to outsource are things the AI can't do, and the tasks it can help with require collaboration.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's almost a mismatch between what you'd most want to delegate and what AI can actually handle well right now. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes, my employer specifically asks us to use AI regularly, so I make a point of using it and looking for ways it could potentially be helpful. We had an AI staff meeting and staff offered suggestions on ways we should and shouldn't use it.

AI: That sounds like a pretty proactive approach from your workplace. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My employer frequently uses a practice we refer to as "lampshading," where we hint at what we're talking about in the title, but don't say what it is explicitly. For example, we might say "The Director of this $525 Million Monster Movie Wants to Do a Sequel." I asked the model to help me come up with title suggestions that lampshaded the topic, all of its suggestions clearly referenced the topic in the title and many of them added things that were factually incorrect. When I explained what I wanted by lampshading, the model tried to argue with me that lampshading is when you acknowledge a flaw in the title and that my requests were incorrect. The model's definition of lampshading doesn't seem to be supported and I have zero desire to argue with an LLM about the definition of anything. It's a huge waste of time.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when the AI doubled down and tried to argue about your own workplace's terminology rather than just following your clear instructions. That's a perfect example of where the collaboration breaks down.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I have low-level anxiety about losing income all the time. It's a terrible time!

AI: I can really understand that concern - that uncertainty about the future must add a lot of stress to daily work life.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'll continue to use it as instructed by my employer. If AI is every able to handle mundane tasks, I would gladly outsource all of that work to the model, but that doesn't seem to be possible currently.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI struggles with nuanced tasks like understanding your site's voice and terminology, while also being required to use it regularly by your employer.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I've covered everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the gap between what you'd want to delegate versus what AI can actually handle well, and especially those specific examples of where collaboration works and where it breaks down, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through those real examples from your work - it gives us such valuable perspective on how these tools are actually being used day-to-day.
