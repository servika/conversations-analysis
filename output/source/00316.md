Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I don't have any questions yet

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I often use AI when I am stuck in my current workday. Sometimes this can be editing or revising a piece of text (either that I wrote, or that someone sent to me that I'm trying to edit), doing something tedious like updating a contract to be in the form of a different contract, or doing research that I'm not finding the answers to immediately on Google.

AI: That's really helpful to understand those different use cases. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I generally prefer to handle more creative things or things I'm interested in myself. For writing from scratch, I feel like there is a bit of an AI voice that is recognizable. I see it a lot with LinkedIn posts or marketing emails I get from companies. I also don't always feel like I can trust AI for more complex math yet, as I've seen it make errors.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making about creative work and that recognizable AI voice. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I think I'm more likely to collaborate. Some of this is that I'm learning more about how to prompt, so sometimes when I read a response I'll realize I left out a key piece of information that is needed to really produce what I want. I get frustrated sometimes when people send me unedited things from ChatGPT or another AI service, because I can tell and it's usually not solving my problem.

AI: That frustration with unedited AI output is really interesting - it sounds like you've developed a good sense for recognizing when someone hasn't put in that collaborative effort. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We don't really have a clear AI policy at this point, but we have started to see them come out from related organizations, so it's something we're thinking about. I would say I feel shamed by some of more more savvy colleagues, and like I don't want to be that person sending unedited AI texts. I don't feel like I'm adding value by doing that

AI: That's a really honest insight about feeling that pressure to add value rather than just passing along AI output. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: So one time I was pretty satisfied was needing to update a contract for a federal project. Even though I still had to significantly edit what the AI put out because it left out key sections, I still feel like it saved me a lot of time. It also got me started on a project I was sort of dreading.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can help overcome that initial hurdle on a dreaded task. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Sort of - I think that right now, having an authentic human touch is still of value. I think that's why Reddit has been skyrocketing in search results, people want something that is real. I don't know how much there is to do about the longer term future of skills that AI could take over. I think you just have to be willing to continue learning and hope for the best.

AI: That perspective on authenticity and the value of the human touch is really thoughtful. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think looking ahead, we will be using AI much more day to day. Right now, my job doesn't have an official tool, but I could see us getting Microsoft co-pilot or something similar. I think AI will also keep improving and become something we can rely on more without having to double check everything. I also can see us using it more for things like optimizing SEO, adding meta tags, drafting social posts, scheduling emails, financial reporting and more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the importance of that collaborative approach and adding your own human touch rather than just passing along unedited AI output.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think it will be important to have some more guidelines and regulations around AI. I also can see more public pushback coming, as it feels like companies have gone too hard too quickly on AI and it's a bit aggressive and annoying on many websites.

AI: That's a really valuable point about the pace of AI rollout and potential public pushback - those broader dynamics definitely affect how individuals experience and adopt AI tools at work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach, the importance of maintaining that human authenticity, and your observations about workplace culture and the broader AI landscape will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
