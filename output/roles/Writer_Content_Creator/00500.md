Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yep!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an organizational development specialist, which is a component of HR that focuses on facilitating change management, team cohesion, and interpersonal issues at work. I frequently have to design workshops or whole meetings tailored to the needs of a team, so I use AI to help me drafts these meeting outlines, come up with workshop ideas, and flesh out the logistics of an OD intervention. Additionally, I use it to analyze/summarize both qualitative and quantitative data from focus groups, employee surveys, etc to inform my work. I have also occasionally used it to help me find the best communication approach when I'm not sure how to best handle a particularly complex matter, draft emails I didn't have time to write from scratch, and just generally brainstorm.

AI: That's a really comprehensive way you're integrating AI into your OD work. It sounds like you're using it across multiple stages of your process - from initial design through data analysis to communication.

When you mention using AI to help find the best communication approach for complex matters, can you tell me more about how that typically works? What does that interaction look like?

User: sure! there have been times when two leaders were having a disagreement or just couldn't get past their differences, and I've used AI to help me frame how to navigate those conversations so that everyone feels heard and is able to get their point across, and nobody feels dismissed while also helping them to move forward productively. I explain the situation to the model in great detail, explain what sort of intervention/conversational setting I'll be interacting with them in, note what my/their desired outcomes are, and provide any supporting information, organizational guardrails, or other additional context that the model may need to consider when helping me to guide the interaction. I try as hard as I can to eliminate bias, but I know some is inevitable.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - providing all that context and being aware of potential bias. It sounds like you're really using AI as a thinking partner for those delicate interpersonal situations.

When you're preparing for those conversations with conflicting leaders, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI to refine the approach, or do you typically get what you need from describing the situation once and getting a response?

User: definitely back and forth.

AI: Tell me more about that back-and-forth process. What usually prompts you to keep refining with the AI?

User: it'll usually be that something is worded in a way that sounds unnatural that I need help continuing to think through, or the way the model has framed something misses a bit of context. usually something kind of small like that that just needs a bit of tweaking.

AI: That makes sense - those small adjustments to get the framing just right for your specific context.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your OD work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I really prefer to write my own communications. I will sometimes use it for things I don;t have time for, as I said, but I am a gifted writer and overall communicator, so I like to apply that skill whenenver I can (especially since it's glaringly obvious when someone copies and pastes messaging from AI). I also try as hard as I can to only use AI's thoughts as a baseline, and add my creative touch to whatever meeting I'm designing or project I'm on. I also don't ask AI to help with anything that requires me to provide identifying org data.

AI: That's really interesting - you mentioned it's "glaringly obvious" when someone uses AI-generated messaging. What are the telltale signs you notice that tip you off?

User: there's a pattern to AI's communication. it always starts with some kind of affirmation, is very robotic, overly perfect, often structured very similarly.. ESPECIALLY if anyone leaves those lines that AI likes to throw in to section out large bodies of text, or emojis in headings/subheadings. dead giveaway.

AI: That's a sharp observation about those structural patterns and formatting choices. It sounds like your professional eye for communication really picks up on those subtle markers.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it seems like you're collaborating with it throughout a task rather than just handing something off completely - is that accurate?

User: yep! definitely collaborating. i'll give it all the information I told you about, read its' response, then go back and forth asking it to tweeak one things or another, asking it why it made a certain choice, and so on.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really deliberate - especially asking the AI why it made certain choices. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people generally open about using it, or is there a particular attitude toward AI tools in your organization?

User: yes and no. I use AI MUCH more than anyone else in my particular business function, but other areas of the org do use it more. my company is a maaajor late adopter when it comes to AI, so I'd say really any use of it goes against the grain of what the culture currently calls for. I don't think attitudes around AI are even openly discussed (at least not in the rooms I'm in) because we are the USA subsidiary of a global org, and that global org hasn't released cut and dry policy around AI, so we just have to follow suit in a haze of ambiguity.

AI: That's fascinating - operating in that "haze of ambiguity" while being ahead of your colleagues in adoption. It sounds like you're navigating uncharted territory without clear organizational guidance.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: it's funny you ask--my research capstone in graduate school (I just graduated recently) studied the relationship between AI utilization at work and an employee's perception of org effectiveness, individual effectiveness, workplace satisfaction, NPS, and so on. anyway, I recently had to come up with a meeting design based on another very popular OD intervention program that my company didn't want to pay for, and I was very satisfied with the way that AI helped me to come up with a 'bootlegged' version of that program that didn't require a lot of the proprietary IP that the inspiration utilized. it was really nice to be able to give the business leader what they wanted in sentiment without incurring the cost.

AI: That's a perfect example of AI helping you create real business value - getting the essence of what was needed without the licensing costs. It sounds like that collaborative process really paid off.

Since you actually studied this relationship between AI use and workplace perceptions in your graduate research, I'm curious - how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: it's definitely something I consider. I want to maintain my skills anyway, because anyone who is genuinely a solid user of AI is using it as a partner, not a crutch. I need to still understand the research and tools that the AI is drawing from so that I know when to question, how something can be made better, and when AI misses altogether.

AI: That's a really wise perspective - seeing AI as requiring your expertise to use it effectively rather than replacing it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Especially given that organizational ambiguity you mentioned earlier - do you see that changing?

User: I think I'll likely be using it more as my work gets more technical (I'm transitioning to people analytics at some point in the future). so the way I use it will change, but I also will likely be using it in a more regimented, prescriptive way when global finally catches up and employs an org-specific model like so many other big companies do.

AI: That transition to people analytics sounds like it will open up some interesting new applications for AI in your work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a partner rather than a crutch, and how you navigate that organizational ambiguity while being an early adopter.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I'd just want you to know that even in some huge companies like mine, the literacy around AI in certain areas of the business is almost 0. there's lots of discourse out there about using AI in HR, but HR is notoriously full of people who are not intellectually curious and lack technical skill, so I think this will be an area of interest where it's important for people to either upskill or get very, very left behind. that's all!

AI: That's a really valuable insight about the skills gap and intellectual curiosity factor, especially in a field like HR where AI could have such significant applications. The contrast you're drawing between the potential and the current reality is quite striking.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating organizational ambiguity, using AI as a collaborative partner, and the varying levels of AI literacy across different business functions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
