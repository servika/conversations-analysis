Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hey. All good. Fire away

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Ok. So I run a design business, I create and sell prints, tote bags, bespoke design work etc. I use AI to bounce ideas off, for social media, for product descriptions, timelines.

AI: That sounds like quite a range of uses across your business. When you say you bounce ideas off AI, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: Mostly we chat about how to grow the business, things I can do to get more traction in retail, especially social media.

AI: Tell me more about those conversations. When you're discussing business growth or retail strategies, how do those exchanges typically unfold?

User: I'll generally start with a few ideas of new products I might like to try. I'll ask AI for opinions, and for other options, or suggestions. Then we bounce ideas around and I'll end up saving a few in some documents

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like a back-and-forth process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your design business you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I definitely like to handle the design process myself, anything that is likely to end up with a client, I need to be sure it comes from me.

AI: What makes those client-facing design tasks feel different to you? What is it about that work that makes you want to keep it in your own hands?

User: Authenticity really. As a creative person, I'm not comfortable selling something I haven't created

AI: That makes a lot of sense. When you do use AI for work - like those brainstorming sessions or social media tasks - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends. I've asked for help with schedule planning, that tends to be 90% AI with some input from me. For anything else, I will collaborate and then once I'm set, I'll go ahead with no further AI use on the creative tasks.

AI: So it sounds like there are really different modes depending on the task. For those collaborative sessions - like when you're bouncing around business ideas or working on social media content - what does that collaboration actually look like in practice?

User: I'll generally suggest a new project I need to promote, and then ask for some initial ideas. I'll take those, maybe select a few, and then suggest tweaks and ask for opinions on those. Then, once we've had a back and fore, I'll create the content myself and schedule posts.

AI: How have your colleagues or clients - or even the broader creative community you're part of - influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: To be honest, seeing more and more obvious AI work out there has made me even more determined to ensure my work is 100% designed by me. I've been at artisan markets where people are selling AI art for way more than my work, and it's pretty galling to see people lap it up.

AI: That sounds frustrating. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't think I've ever been strongly satisfied or frustrated using AI myself. I just use it as a back and fore, and I think I understand the limitations quite well.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective. When you say you understand the limitations quite well, what are the key things you've learned about where AI works well for you versus where it doesn't?

User: AI for me works really well when I know roughly what I want to get out of the exchange. It's a hugely valuable tool in providing options that I may not have thought of.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: For sure. I used to be a Java developer and I think if I used AI I would be less inclined to keep up with the language. As a designer, I actively make sure that I am striving to think of new ways to develop my work.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to have a good relationship with AI where needed, as an assistant for planning, strategising, helping with engaging content for social media. I don't see it ever dictating what I do with my art.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that clear boundary between using AI as a strategic assistant while keeping your creative work authentically your own.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that treating AI as a colleague to bounce ideas off is for sure the most useful way I've found of making the most of its capabilities.

AI: That's a great way to put it - treating AI as a colleague to bounce ideas off. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your creative authenticity will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
