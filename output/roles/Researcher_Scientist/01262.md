Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yep. My only question is that I'm currently a Masters student rather than a career scientist, is that OK?

AI: That's absolutely perfect! Masters students are doing real scientific research and often bring fresh perspectives on how AI fits into research workflows. Your experiences are exactly what we're interested in learning about.

Great, let's get started then. 

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently completed my Design Project - one of the most testing projects in a chemical engineering degree; this is in anticipation of a "Research Project" next year which involves no design, though to say research was involved in the Design Project would be quite the insult!

 This project combines technical knowledge (from textbooks and prior technical learning) with significant literature review (ultimately 99 sources in my case) to design a process plant - initially as a group, culminating in a 45-page individual design report. 

All students in the cohort were given a list of project briefs - which were very brief indeed - and asked to pick a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice. In my case, I was in a group of 6 fellow chemical engineering students designing a plant based in Cornwall, near the St Austell China clay mines, producing 20,000tn per year of a battery-grade lithium product. This mirrors the actual plans of a company named British Lithium (a subsidiary of Imerys), an organisation which has links to University personnel, ultimately they no doubt saw the potential benefits of having undergraduate minds working for free on problems which they might face in designing the real plant!

We started off researching existing lithium product plants across the world (there are no commercial lithium refining plants in the UK), and analysing the mineralogical report which we had been provided for the real granite to be used, which contained a small % content of polylithionite. We then came up with some process design characteristics which allowed us to complete an in-depth Hazard Study after greatly researching the chemicals and processes involved. We also researched more radical processing techniques currently in development at lab scale, to see if we could bring something new to the industry.

Economic analysis after researching relevant tax information and industry chemical/energy pricing allowed us to pitch the design to a mock board of investors, and we thusly went onto individual design.

As individuals, we each designed a sixth of the plant in such detail that the process units could actually be procured. I designed the beneficiation process, and so researched several processes, including the comminution units - including the thermodynamics and equipment required, based on both technical research and industrial information. I also researched in significant depth the fluid mechanics involved in froth flotation, the specific unit which my design used in a radical fashion. Additionally, acid-base reactions and mixing dynamics needed to be well researched for my area of the process.

With reaction and process dynamics researched, research into the materials to be used for the process units (including some material engineering analysis) led to full design being possible.

With all this done, I was able to write the report.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly comprehensive and rigorous project - designing a full industrial lithium extraction plant from mineralogical analysis through to economic viability. The scope from literature review through hazard analysis to detailed unit operations design really captures the breadth of engineering work.

Where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: AI tools were absolutely life-saving when it came to finding industrial information buried deep in business websites, where it perhaps was not easily found via search engines. It was also especially useful in rephrasing descriptions of certain phenomena, such as some complicated physics involved in hydrophobicity.

Otherwise, I found AI useful for proofreading and coming up with new ideas where I was finding myself on wild goose chases.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helped you both with information discovery and with communication. 

Tell me more about how you used AI to find that industrial information buried in business websites. What was that process like?

User: It would generally involve me being a bit stuck! A common thing I encountered would be a situation where equations relevant to certain phenomena (eg: froth flotation, the process I designed most in depth) would be very rigorous, but demand very specific properties of the fluids to be used - for example, the Young equation. I was using some proprietary chemicals with absolutely no material properties publicised whatsoever, but even things like eclectic mineral mixes in a slurry becomes impossible to calculate for. If I were a real design engineer, it would be a no-brainer that my company would simply build bench- and pilot-scale plants for empirical analysis rather than theoretical calculations, but sadly I was just a student with no million-pound pilot plant or years to spend testing with it...

With AI, I was able to find esoteric and often old papers or industry websites that gave example figures which I could assume to be applicable (for example, impeller diameters in similar slurry plants) in the absence of my own empirical testing.

AI: That's a fascinating use case - AI helping you bridge that gap between theoretical equations that require precise parameters and the real-world constraints of student research where you can't run your own empirical tests.

For that specific task of finding those esoteric papers and industry examples, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of literature searching.

User: Quite frankly - desperation! This report took weeks to produce, and I found myself at the main focus of the report (froth flotation unit design) and the thought was entering my mind that it might not be possible with the information available.

AI: That really paints the picture - when you hit those roadblocks where traditional literature searching wasn't yielding what you needed, AI became the lifeline to move forward.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your design project where you didn't use AI - like the hazard analysis, economic calculations, or materials selection - what kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: Quite frankly, those were more a matter of following a code-based process, there was little need for creative thinking.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - when you have established codes and procedures to follow, the process is more straightforward.

When you did use AI for finding those industrial examples and parameter values, how did you verify or validate what it produced for you?

User: Often, if an academic paper was found by the AI, I was able to view the paper found (Gemini shows sources) and then even verify the citations used in the paper if needed by viewing it myself.

AI: That's a smart approach - using the source visibility to do your own verification. It sounds like having those traceable sources was important for maintaining academic rigor.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I think I'd have it write impartial abstracts (not necessarily short!) that include all the facts and figures which should be included in an abstract

AI: That's a really specific and thoughtful wish! The idea of having AI create comprehensive, fact-filled abstracts that capture all the key technical details without bias - that would save a lot of time and potentially catch things you might overlook.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a problem-solving tool when traditional methods hit walls, and how you balanced that creative application with rigorous verification, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, thanks!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a last resort when traditional literature searching failed, and how you maintained academic integrity through source verification, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering research work. 

It's especially valuable to hear from a student perspective - how AI can bridge those gaps between theoretical knowledge and practical application when you don't have access to industry-scale testing facilities.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
