Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I do not have any questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One of the most meaningful projects I worked on to date, was studying vision restoration in patients with age-related macular degeneration. For this study, we utilized immunocompromised rat models as patients. My specific focus was on post-transplant imaging of the patients retinal layer (cross sectional analysis of transplant to determine if success) using optical coherence tomography, which allowed us to track structural changes in the retina over time. We implanted stem cells into the retinal layer and over the course of the study, we were able to demonstrate measurable restoration of vision, which was incredibly exciting. The process, from the initial idea of testing regenerative approaches in a chronic disease model to actually witnessing functional improvements, showed me how translational research can bridge the discovery and real hope for patients.

AI: That sounds like incredibly impactful work - being able to demonstrate actual vision restoration must have been really rewarding. The process you described from implantation through tracking structural changes with OCT imaging sounds quite complex.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: In that project, I found AI most useful in optimizing experimental setup and in handling the complexity of the data analysis. For example, when we were designing the study, AI tools helped me simulate different approaches to dosing and timing, which saved us from pursuing less efficient trial and error paths. On the back end, the imaging data from optical coherence tomography is incredibly nuanced, and AI assisted analysis proved to be a great addition to QC, where any diagnostic images that had unclear or ambiguous features were analyzed by AI as a secondary check to detect subtle changes in the retinal structure that might have been missed otherwise. It did not replace our expertise, and often made meaningful errors, but it gave us sharper insights and helped my team refine both the design and interpretation of the study at various point throughout our research.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you found AI valuable as both a planning tool upfront and a quality control mechanism for your imaging analysis. You mentioned that the AI often made meaningful errors but still provided sharper insights.

For that OCT imaging analysis specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for reviewing those diagnostic images.

User: As part of QC, any lab specimen that did not take to the experimental treatment (e.g., developed tumors within the retinal layer in response to the stem cell implant) would have to be ethically disposed of. With that said, it was incredibly important that the right conclusions were drawn from the imaging stage of the study. AI was often used as a second opinion in this case, to either agree with or disagree with my findings, and/or identify areas in need of closer examination. This would very much help with experimental accuracy where it is most important.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a second opinion in those critical decision points where you need to determine whether to continue or ethically dispose of specimens. The stakes are really high there both ethically and scientifically.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: In the behavioral side of the study, particularly testing vision restoration using light therapy and the striped spinning device. I never leaned on AI as much for this aspect of our study. The main reason is that these tests heavily rely on direct observation of eye movement, which feels straightforward enough that adding another layer of analysis hasn't seemed necessary. There is also a tactile, intuitive aspect  to working with live specimens that doesn't always translate well into automated systems.

AI: That's really insightful - the tactile, intuitive aspect of working with live specimens is something I hadn't considered. It sounds like there's a qualitative dimension to observing those eye movements and behaviors that feels important to preserve through direct human observation.

When you've used AI for that OCT imaging analysis as a second opinion, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I often would treat the AI as a blinded second reader and verify its calls against masked human grading and predefined QC thresholds, then look for agreement using metrics like Bland-Altman plots and interclass correlation. On a subset, I would anchor the 'truth' with orthogonal signals (histology or ERG where available) to make sure structural flags actually track function. I would also stress tests the model on out of distribution scans and review all discordant cases to tune thresholds before anything influences a conclusion.

AI: That's a really thorough validation approach - using it as a blinded reader, anchoring against histology and ERG, and stress testing with out-of-distribution scans shows a lot of methodological rigor. It sounds like you've developed quite a systematic process for ensuring the AI's contributions are reliable.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would want AI to handle the behavioral side of vision testing, where we track eye movements in response to light therapy and moving patterns. Right now, it depends on manual observation, which is time-consuming and subject to subtle human bias. An AI system that could capture micro-movements with high precision and quantify them consistently would give us a much clearer readout of visual function.

AI: That's a compelling vision - being able to quantify those micro-movements with high precision could really transform how you measure functional outcomes. It sounds like it would address both the time burden and the potential for subtle human bias you mentioned.

Looking back at everything we've discussed - from using AI for experimental design simulation, to OCT imaging quality control, to this potential future application in behavioral testing - what strikes me is how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI where it adds value while maintaining your own expertise in areas that require that human intuition. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, not at the moment.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a "blinded second reader" and your systematic validation approach really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you've balanced leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining rigorous verification standards is particularly valuable for us to hear about.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective on this work has been incredibly helpful.

User: No problem! Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much - it was really a pleasure speaking with you today. Your work on vision restoration sounds absolutely fascinating, and I learned a lot from hearing about your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into such critical research. Take care!
