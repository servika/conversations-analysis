Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine, I'm looking forward to getting started.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: While I don't generally use AI on a day-to-day basis currently, I do use it a few times a week. Specifically, I work in finance and am heavily involved in analytical work, I typically upload spreadsheets, graphs, and such, to not only give an opinion, but also to give a clearer picture on lots of data and identify where potential weaknesses are in the current process that I employ

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI as an analytical partner to help you make sense of complex financial data and spot process improvements. 

Tell me more about what happens when you upload those spreadsheets and graphs. What does that interaction look like for you?

User: So I would upload say a spreadsheet or a graph, and ask AI to condense certain information, or explain how this data is comparable to say the same data from 12 months ago - it is used for constant improvement for myself and also the strategy at work that I employ. Almost to keep refining my edge. And if the data is not as promising, I would ask AI to give suggestions on why that might be the case (the flip-side is also true, I might ask it to highlight what I am doing well)

AI: So you're using AI to help you continuously refine your analytical edge - both identifying what's working and what might need adjustment. That's a really strategic approach.

When you're working through this process of uploading data and getting these insights, are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth conversation with the AI as you work through the analysis, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle the full analysis independently?

User: So I have done both versions, a back-and-forth and also a complete task at once, now I have refined the initial prompt that I ask, I tend to let it handle the full analysis and if I have any subsequent questions we would enter a back and forth conversation

AI: That makes sense - you've evolved your approach over time to become more efficient with your initial prompts. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of your financial analysis work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I tend to perform the simple calculations myself, I obviously use a spreadsheet which helps with the complex mathematical calculations, which is something that AI could of course help me with too. If there's a headline number or percentage that I'm seeking, I typically re-run the calculation myself on paper just for reinforcement that it is correct - this could be something where I use AI to also complete this check for me.

AI: So you're keeping control of those foundational calculations and doing your own verification - that sounds like maintaining a certain level of hands-on oversight even when AI could handle it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: The use of AI has certainly become more prevalent in the workplace over the last 12-18 months, that is for sure. Even appearing in conversations, through general discussion or seminars. So I guess the fact that more people are talking about it, and using it, makes me also want to be involved and learn and discover new ways that could make my job  easier.

AI: That peer influence and growing workplace acceptance really seems to have opened the door for exploration. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think in terms of feeling satisfied, I had to give a presentation on a month's data, and I ask AI to expand on a spreadsheet, not just including the positives and negatives of the data, but also suggest reasons as to why the data was good/bad, what improvements could be made to the process etc., and it gave me quite a few points that I had not thought of. In fact, a couple of them were implemented too

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like AI helped you see blind spots in your own analysis and actually led to real process improvements being implemented. That must have felt pretty validating.

On the flip side, have you had any experiences with AI that left you feeling frustrated or disappointed? What was going on in those situations?

User: I haven't had a real disappointment before, sometimes I can get frustrated if the response is too long or there's other issues that prevent it from giving me my desired response. So, technological errors on the side of the AI

AI: So it sounds like the content quality has been solid for you, but those technical hiccups - like overly verbose responses or system issues - can disrupt your workflow.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I mean, this is certainly a hot topic, and it is something that I think about. Potentially, AI could take over, although there's lots of moving cogs currently in my job, and I only actively seek AI help for the last step or two. However, over time, I could certainly see it doing my entire job, effectively, quicker, and cheaper.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - acknowledging that while you're currently using AI for specific steps, the trajectory could eventually encompass much more of your role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What do you think that might look like for you?

User: I feel that I would use it more in my work day, it might even take over certain steps for me, allowing me to dedicate time during the day to other areas. So I feel positive about the near future and what that might look like for me.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to look at it - seeing AI as potentially freeing up your time to focus on other valuable areas rather than just replacing what you do.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've evolved your approach over time - from experimenting with different interaction styles to refining your prompts, and how that presentation example showed AI helping you discover blind spots that led to actual process improvements.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so. Other than the overall experience so far, has been more helpful than one of frustration and annoyance.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've strategically integrated AI into your financial analysis work, evolved your interaction patterns, and maintained that balance between AI assistance and your own oversight will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate the time you've taken to walk through this with me today. Your perspective has been very valuable.

User: Thank you very much.

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for participating - it's been really insightful to hear about your experiences. Have a great rest of your day!
