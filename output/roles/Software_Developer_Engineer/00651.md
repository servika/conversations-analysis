Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions-- sounds good!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I tend to use AI for analyzing manufacturing data, generating C# code that automates reports on the same data, understanding Operational Technology concepts that are newer to me, and brainstorming User Interfaces for SCADA/HMI layouts.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of technical applications. It sounds like you're working in industrial automation or manufacturing operations.

When you mention analyzing manufacturing data, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you and the AI work together on that kind of analysis?

User: Say for example I have a lot of raw data from a PLC. Due to some proprietary processes, I won't explain the actual processes in my plant, but I'll give a good equivalent. Let's pretend I work in a bread factory. From the PLC, I'm getting the weights of each batch of dough before it goes into an oven. Sometimes the operators weigh the dough correctly, sometimes not. The *volume* of the dough is always the same, but the weight will vary a bit due to processes from our dough supplier that are out of my control. However, using AI, I'm able to feed it several thousand entries of dough weights and generate an SPC (Statistical Process Control) analysis for me. I can even eliminate the outliers (for example, when operators don't weigh the dough correctly, it's very obvious, so we can ignore those weights). Then, I have AI explain the math and concepts behind SPC to me, and have it assist me with processing that data in a backend language such as Python or C# so I can automate SPC reports on-the-fly based on the most recent PLC data.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow. It sounds like you're using AI as both an analytical partner and a teacher in that process.

When you're working through that SPC analysis, are you more collaborating with the AI step-by-step - like having it explain concepts as you go and then building the solution together - or do you tend to give it the full task and let it handle large chunks independently?

User: I first tend to go step-by-step with it, then after I feel I understand the process correctly, I'll calculate new SPC numbers based on a different set of PLC data, then feed that data to an AI model to verify that my calculations were correct. This way, I get to learn the *how* and *why* behind any type of new concept I come across, and get to verify that I truly understand it. The same goes for different C# coding concepts.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as both a teacher and then as a verification partner. It sounds like maintaining your own understanding is important to you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I would say that there are definitely a few. I enjoy writing emails in my own personality, and almost never outsource any administrative writing to AI. Sometimes I'll have AI help me make a sentence or two less confusing, but that's it. So for anything personal, I tend to avoid AI for that. I also avoid using AI to solve some of my "nerdier" tasks, such as bit manipulation and low-level functions in C#. I'm sure it does a great job, but getting to enjoy the "nerdier" aspects of my work is huge for me. Even in those cases, however, I will usually throw my code into an AI bot real quick to verify I did it correctly.

AI: I love that distinction you're making - keeping the "nerdier" technical challenges for yourself because you genuinely enjoy them, while still using AI as that verification step. And it sounds like anything that reflects your personality, like emails, stays in your hands.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently than your coworkers?

User: I was the first person in our office to keep Gemini proudly displayed on my laptop. After I started talking about it more and explaining how it was saving me a few hours a week by avoiding monotonous tasks, I suddenly noticed a large increase in AI usage in my workplace. There's definitely this sense of "laziness" that people glean from me using AI (and I get some lighthearted comments poking fun at me), but in reality they know it just frees my time up so I can keep building upward. I'm certainly not looked down upon for using it.

AI: It sounds like you've become something of an AI evangelist in your workplace! That's interesting that you went from being the pioneer to seeing broader adoption after people saw the practical benefits.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have had *multiple* times where I paste a large, repetitive C# Dictionary object (imagine Dictionary[REDACTED]) and there's an obvious pattern that needs to be filled out for several hundred key and value entries. I ask an AI model to "Continue the pattern" for me (some brevity in my prompts, as I'm usually juggling 3 other things at the moment), and the model absolutely insists that it cannot find a pattern. Even after I explain it's a C# Dictionary variable with key value strings, it still refuses to autofill. This has been an odd yet persistent issue for me for several months.

AI: That's such a specific and recurring frustration! It must be particularly maddening when you can clearly see the pattern but the AI keeps insisting it can't find one, especially when you're juggling multiple things and just need it to handle something straightforward.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Sure, I think it's good to still maintain those skills, but I maintain them from a more administrative standpoint. For example, I'm more of a software engineer now, than a software developer. I work more on the "bigger picture" and let AI do some of the smaller details. I see it as a junior colleague that will make mistakes, but is overall very beneficial and removes a lot of work from my plate. I have still know the concepts of, say, C# string manipulation, for that one weird time when AI totally goes off the rails and messes that up. AI messes up just enough for me that it's still worth knowing basic concepts inside and out.

AI: That's a really insightful way to frame it - shifting from developer to engineer, focusing on the bigger picture while AI handles details. I like your analogy of AI as a junior colleague that's helpful but still makes mistakes.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it as relatively stagnant at the moment. It's probably not going to assist me much more than it already is, but I'd love to be wrong. I'm definitely optimistic, yet realistic about its growth.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as both a learning partner and verification tool, and how you've evolved into more of an engineering role while maintaining your technical foundation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so! Those were some great questions. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about the balance between collaboration and verification, maintaining technical skills while evolving your role, and even those frustrating pattern recognition moments - it's all incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were in walking through your actual workflow and the nuanced ways you think about working with AI. Have a great rest of your day!
