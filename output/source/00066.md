Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready for the conversation, and I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I collaborate with other researchers who are either undergraduates, medical students, or physicians to write journal articles for medical journals. A recent project we worked on was a review paper on massive transfusion for trauma patients. The initials idea for this paper came about when working on other projects related to the topic, and we thought that it would be a good topic to focus on. It was a long process of research, looking through the literature, planning writing, and creating figures. The final output was a review that included tables and figures and summarized the current state of the literature.

AI: That sounds like a comprehensive project. Tell me more about that research and writing process - what were the main stages you went through from deciding on the topic to having that final review ready for submission?

User: The main stages was first drafting out an outline for what we wanted to talk about in this review. We made section headers and tried to organize our thoughts. We pulled from previous research and used a table that was going to go in one of our other papers but was cut because it was not as relevant to the main topic of that paper. Then, we started writing after getting our general thoughts down. Throughout this process we went back to the literature to find more articles and revised our initial outline to better reflect how our vision for the paper changed as time went on. Then we started focusing on creating the figures to summarize certain parts of our review and writing the abstract, conclusion, and keywords. We used EndNote to make the bibliography, and I formatted the article to fit the journal guidelines before submitting it.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - I can see how iterative that process was with the outline evolving as you dove deeper into the literature. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We used AI to help us find more articles in the literature. Often ChatGPT or OpenEvidence could find an article that is applicable to our paper that we were not able to find. We also used it to describe difficult topics or to summarize papers, but we made sure to not only trust the AI to do the thinking for us. We tried to find references to back up what the AI said, or asked to AI to find sources to back up its information.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found AI particularly useful for literature discovery and explanation. For those tasks where you did use AI - like finding articles or getting explanations of difficult topics - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of searching databases or other methods you might have used before.

User: We would usually go to AI if Google or PubMed was not able to find some good sources or if we just wanted to see if there were more out there. If there were no good explanations from sources that we could find, we would go to AI to explain it and then ask it for references to see if what it said was true.

AI: So it sounds like AI became your fallback when traditional search methods hit a wall. That makes a lot of sense.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the initial outlining, the actual writing, creating figures, or formatting - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I think we definitely might use AI in the future perhaps to propose an outline, but I think that at this point, it's just not that difficult to format a paper to a journal's specifications, and creating figures is something that is very specific and collaborative, so I just don't know how helpful AI could be for that. Overall, I just don't think it has been extremely difficult to do those things, so we have not use AI for them.

AI: That makes sense - if something isn't a bottleneck in your workflow, there's less incentive to change it. 

Going back to when you have used AI for finding articles and explanations, how do you verify or validate what it produces? You mentioned asking for references, but I'd love to hear more about your specific process for checking AI's work.

User: We ask the AI specifically for journal articles that we then read through to see if what it is saying makes sense. We check that paper's references before we decide to use it, as well.

AI: That's a thorough verification process. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I have one more forward-looking question for you.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would want AI to be 100% accurate so that it is completely trustable as a resource. As of now, I don't think I can always trust what the AI says. If it was completely accurate, I would want it to help with statistical analysis and to tell me what statistical tests to run or even how to design an experiment well.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the trust piece seems central to everything. Statistical analysis and experimental design are such critical areas where accuracy is paramount.

Those are all my questions. Your thoughts on how trust drives your decision-making with AI, and the way you've developed that systematic verification process, were particularly valuable insights. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a fallback when traditional methods hit limitations, and especially how you've developed that careful verification process of checking references and cross-validating information, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

I appreciate you taking the time to walk through your research process in such detail. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.
