Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use it most days, but when I do use it I tend to use it for coming up with ways to word messages or problem solving when I need more strategies

AI: That's interesting that it's more of an occasional tool for you rather than something you use daily. When you do turn to AI for help with wording messages, what kinds of messages are those typically? Are these work emails, presentations, or something else?

User: It is usually for things like how to respond to emails or texts while sounding professional. I think I usually come across pretty direct and sometimes like to have help wording things using more business language

AI: That makes sense - finding that right professional tone can be tricky. When you mentioned you also use AI for problem solving to get more strategies, can you tell me more about what those situations look like? What kinds of problems do you find yourself needing additional strategies for?

User: Sometimes I have unique situations arise where I don't know what else to do to fix the problem, or I want to fix the problem while avoiding something else.

AI: Could you walk me through what one of those unique situations looked like? What was the problem you were trying to solve, and how did AI help you approach it differently?

User: A couple of times I wanted to create signs that informed customers of the facility rules, but I wanted to make sure they would really notice the parts that were frequently missed. There are certain rules that get broken multiple times a day and I don't think people are always noticing the signs that tell them it isn't allowed, especially because there are a lot of different signs and multiple rules

AI: That's a really practical challenge - getting important information to actually stick out among all the other signage. What kinds of strategies did AI suggest for making those frequently-missed rules more noticeable? Did any of them work particularly well in practice?

User: It was helpful in shortening the message. People usually just glance at the signs, so having a shorter message about the rules makes it more effective

AI: That's a smart insight about people just glancing at signs. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: We sometimes need to come up with team names and I really enjoy being creative and coming up with something myself, but it can be difficult to come up with something unique that still sounds cool. There was one time we had a team called "Blister Sisters" and we wanted a name for the men's team that was similar. I first thought of "Bruiser Brothers" but my coworker thought it could come across as violent, so I had to come up with something else. I did like my initial idea of having two B words, so I was trying to think of another word that was soccer related and began with a B to replace bruiser. I actually ended up Googling soccer terms that began with B to come up with the team name "Bench Brothers". The team loved it. It does feel more satisfying than just passing along something AI came up with.

AI: I love that story - you can really hear the satisfaction in how you describe working through that creative process yourself. The progression from "Blister Sisters" to "Bruiser Brothers" to "Bench Brothers" shows such thoughtful problem-solving. What is it about that creative process that makes it feel more satisfying to do yourself rather than getting AI's help?

User: I have always been a more creative person, so it makes me feel talented and useful when I can provide something creative that others can't. It also makes me feel like a piece of me was appreciated.

AI: That's really meaningful - having that personal connection to the creative work and feeling recognized for something uniquely yours. When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collab with it. I would really like to see it take over tasks for me, especially the ones I don't like to do, like mass texting.

AI: It sounds like there's a gap there between what you'd ideally want - AI handling entire tasks like mass texting - and what you're actually experiencing, which is more of a back-and-forth collaboration. What does that collaboration typically look like when you're working through something with AI?

User: Usually I get stuck on something so I give the AI what I have so far and see how it can improve it or how it can get me to the next step. This was the case with the signs, where I supplied it with all the rules I wanted it to have, but AI help me reduce it down to something shorter without removing anything important.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - bringing AI in when you hit a roadblock or need to refine something you've started. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you use it differently, or is there any particular attitude toward AI tools at your workplace?

User: Yes, my boss uses AI to design our shirts now. This really disappointed me because I used to work in photo editing for years for another job and I designed some the shirts at this job. I think the new designs are good, but I also think art is kind of cheapened when it is created with AI. I may not be the best graphic designer, but I would have preferred to create the shirt designs myself.

AI: That sounds like a really difficult situation - losing something you enjoyed doing and had skills in to AI. You mentioned the designs are good, but it feels like art is cheapened when created with AI. Can you tell me more about what that feels like when you see those AI-designed shirts being used?

User: It feels like there is nothing special about the AI designs. They don't have any issues, but I think some other people might feel the same if they knew how they were created. It just takes away a personal touch and gives you something that lacks any thought behind it. I think it is fine to use, but it will never be as appreciated as something created by someone who can add meaningful details based on their background or personality.

AI: That perspective really highlights something important about the personal investment and meaning that comes with human creativity. You mentioned earlier that you'd like AI to take over tasks you don't enjoy, like mass texting, but here's a situation where AI taking over something you did enjoy feels very different. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes AI frustrates me when I want it to think of things that aren't cheesy, but AI supplies me with a lot of ideas that are very cringey. It can be one of those things that is hard to define, so it is no surprise that AI doesn't understand the difference.

AI: That's such a relatable frustration - that sense of "you know it when you see it" but it's hard to articulate exactly what makes something feel cringey versus genuinely good. When you run into that situation where AI keeps giving you ideas that feel off-brand or cheesy to you, how do you usually handle it? Do you keep trying to refine your requests, or do you tend to abandon the AI approach at that point?

User: I probably abandon using AI once it gets to that point.

AI: That makes sense - there's probably a point where it feels like more work to keep trying to guide AI away from the cringey suggestions than to just figure it out yourself. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. Most of my skills rely on a human touch to an extent. I find AI to be useful and not a threat. Most of the types of things AI does best are things I don't really want to do anyway.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - seeing AI as handling the tasks you'd rather not do while your skills remain valuable for the human-touch elements. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll find new ways to use it, or do you expect it to stay pretty much the same as how you use it now?

User: Hopefully, we'll use it more and won't have to do as much of the contacting that we spend hours doing every few weeks. It would be nice to have it figure out the returning teams for us.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can be helpful for tasks you'd rather not do, while also hearing about the meaningful difference between AI-created work and something that has your personal creative touch behind it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between wanting AI to handle routine tasks while preserving the meaningful creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
