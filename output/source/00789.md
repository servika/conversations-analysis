Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No. I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have some repetitive tasks that I have to do for my job as [REDACTED] of a law firm. I've been trying to use AI as much as possible to become more productive.  For instance, I am responsible for accounting for the firm.  Many times I use AI to identify a discrepancy between our billing system and Quickbooks.  This is a task I used to have to do by hand and now I just upload the data into AI to quickly find the discrepancy.  I also use AI to format statements of past due invoices for our clients.  We have hundreds of cases that I have to email these statements our for.  I used to format and create these statements by hand.  Now I cut and past the data and have AI do it for me.  Another example is I will have AI write emails for me to make them sound more professional and not have to take the time to craft them.  Another example is I use AI to read and summarize contracts for me.  These are just a few examples.  I typically also tend to now use AI instead of Google search to find the answer to anything I am looking for.

AI: That's a really comprehensive set of uses - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated across different aspects of your role. 

Tell me more about that transition from doing these tasks by hand to using AI. What was that shift like for you when you first started automating things like the billing discrepancies or invoice formatting?

User: It was pure joy.  I have a very wide range of responsibilities from with the firm so if I have to stop to go through data by hand, I end of working many more hours. Being able to upload data and have AI quickly parse through and find the answer has been wonderful.

AI: I can really hear the relief in that - "pure joy" is such a strong way to put it. 

When you think about all these different tasks you're now using AI for, are there certain work responsibilities you still prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Well if I had it my way, I'd let AI do everything.  However right now, I don't know how to get AI to work seamlessly with certain work tasks.  For instance, I am responsible for payroll.  For our hourly employees, their hours worked are in one system and payroll is in a different system.  So I have to do this task myself because I have to log into one system, gather the data and then input it into the payroll system.  If I could figure out how to have AI log in, gather the data, then log into the payroll system and input it, I would definitely do that.

AI: That's fascinating - so it sounds like it's less about preference and more about technical limitations right now. You'd automate payroll too if you could figure out how to get AI to navigate between those different systems.

When you are using AI for the tasks it can handle - like finding billing discrepancies or formatting invoices - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work back and forth with AI throughout the process, or do you tend to give it everything it needs upfront and let it handle the complete task independently?

User: I typically give it everything it needs up front by uploading all the data at hand and write a prompt to let it know exactly what to do and then let it complete the task independently.

AI: That makes sense - sounds like you've developed a pretty streamlined approach of setting it up with clear instructions and letting it run.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at the firm using it similarly, or has your approach been different from what you see around you?

User: My approach is different because everyone else at the firm is either an attorney, paralegal or law clerk.  In fact, our firm made everyone sign an agreement that they would not use AI for legal research or drafting legal motions, etc.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're in a unique position where your administrative and financial responsibilities allow you to use AI freely, while the legal professionals are restricted from using it for their core work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes I feel like I can't trust the results AI gives me if the data I put in isn't formatted in a very straightforward way.  For instance, Quickbooks downloads are not formatted well, the AI sometimes seems to get confused reading this type of data and then gives me garbage results.

AI: That's a really important insight - so when the data isn't clean or well-formatted going in, you can't rely on what comes out. 

Tell me more about how you handle that uncertainty. When you get results from AI, especially with messier data like those Quickbooks downloads, what do you do to verify the output or decide whether to trust it?

User: ha, I usually yell at the AI and tell it to try harder.  Seriously though, I will usually have to do things the old way, by hand if I don't trust the results.

AI: Ha! I can picture that - yelling at the AI to try harder. That's actually a pretty telling response though - when the AI fails you, you're back to square one doing it manually.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or are you more focused on finding ways to automate as much as possible?

User: I would love it if AI could take over.  My law firm is very old school, as most law firms are.  They probably wouldn't even catch on that I have automated all of my work.  I'm assuming at this stage, they'd still want human eyes on everything.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - you're essentially operating under the radar with your automation while the firm maintains that "human eyes on everything" expectation.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading, especially given that tension between your desire to automate and the firm's more traditional approach?

User: I think they will be late adopters.  I've tried to get them to looks at legal AI products and they never bite.  I'm assuming 99% of my job will eventually be taken over by AI

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being in that unique position where you can automate freely while the legal professionals around you are restricted - and that tension between wanting to automate everything and working in a very traditional environment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I worry about confidentiality and data security.  Most of the data I am feeding to the AI is confidential or definitively should not be seen by employees, competitors, etc.  If I'm unsure about something being strictly confidential, I always ask the main partner first because I don't want to break any rules

AI: That's a really crucial point - thank you for bringing that up. The confidentiality concern adds another layer of complexity to your AI usage that's quite important for us to understand. It sounds like you've developed a practice of checking with the main partner when you're uncertain about what's safe to share.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI adoption in a traditional legal environment while managing confidentiality concerns will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! I really appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences with me today. Take care!
