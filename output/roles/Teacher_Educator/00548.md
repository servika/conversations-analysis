Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a teaching assistant at a secondary school. Myself and other staff are starting to use AI more frequently to assist in preparing learning resources, especially in adapting learning material to suit students who have special learning needs.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work. When you're adapting learning materials for students with special needs, what does that process typically look like for you when you're working with AI?

User: Usually I would upload a worksheet or another task that I already have prepared, and ask AI how I can change it or my teaching style to be more inclusive to those with special needs.

AI: Tell me more about that process. When you upload a worksheet and ask for those adaptations, what kinds of changes does the AI typically suggest, and how do you decide which suggestions to actually implement?

User: The AI may suggest something like "I recommend increasing font size and text colour for students with dyslexia". I know my students and their needs well enough that I can tell if a suggestion is actually going to be useful.

AI: That's really insightful - you're using your knowledge of your specific students to filter the AI's suggestions. Can you walk me through a specific example where your judgment led you to reject or modify something the AI recommended?

User: Sometimes the AI will suggest removing harder questions from worksheets for students who are at a lower reading level. I reject this because just because someone has learning difficulties doesn't mean they should be separated out from the rest of the class or made to feel different. Things that they may find harder they may just need support with, or adaptations to make the work more accessible.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making there. So it sounds like you're looking for adaptations that maintain the same level of challenge but make it more accessible, rather than reducing the difficulty. When the AI suggests something like removing harder questions, how do you typically redirect it to get the kind of suggestions you're actually looking for?

User: I would adjust my prompt to something such as "read this worksheet and suggest any adaptations that could be made to the content to make it more accessible for a student with the reading level of a 10 year old, without changing the core lesson or the main learning goals."

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - being that specific about maintaining the learning goals while asking for accessibility changes. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of adapting materials or teaching that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Absolutely. At my school all resources are shared between teachers and I think it's really important that these are made, at least initially, by real people, particularly as we need to know that materials and teaching are sticking to the curriculum. I also think its important that teachers and support staff know their own material, and I worry that too much reliance on AI will lower the quality of teaching.

AI: That concern about knowing your own material really resonates. When you say you worry about AI lowering the quality of teaching, can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? What have you observed or what scenarios concern you most?

User: If teachers and support staff rely too heavily on AI I find that students do too. Instead of going to teachers for help with learning and assignments, students go to AI. This means we as teachers can't properly assess where a student is at education wise because all of their thinking and work is being done by AI.

AI: That's a really concrete example of how AI use can ripple through the classroom dynamic. It sounds like you're seeing this happen already with your students. How have your colleagues or your school's approach influenced the way you navigate using AI while avoiding that over-reliance you're concerned about?

User: We have very clear boundaries on how we use AI. It's not something we encourage students to use at all, and we've been told that we should only be using approved school resources as our base material, rather than creating brand new resources from AI.

AI: Those boundaries sound like they give you a clear framework to work within. Can you share a time when using AI for your work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was one time that I asked AI to summarise a news article in a way that made it accessible for a class of 10 year olds. The AI did a really good job of this and saved me a lot of time

AI: That sounds like a really effective use case. What specifically made that interaction work so well for you compared to other times you've used AI?

User: I think because it was relatively simple: I just copy and pasted an article and asked the Ai to make it easy for a ten year old to understand. I find its when prompts become more complex that AI struggles

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the clearer and more straightforward the task, the better the outcome. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Absolutely, and it's something I really worry about. I use AI simply as a time saving device, as quite often education staff are under a lot of pressure and have a huge workload. If I have time, I'll do these tasks myself as I would prefer to not use AI

AI: It sounds like you're really thoughtful about balancing efficiency with skill preservation. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, less, or differently as time goes on?

User: I would like to use less of it in the future, I really don't want to become too reliant on it so I think I try to make a conscious effort to not use it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining the learning goals while making materials accessible, and your concerns about how AI use can affect both teacher skills and student learning patterns.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with educational quality, and your thoughtful approach to using AI as a tool rather than a replacement, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and concerns you have around AI use in education. Have a great rest of your day!
