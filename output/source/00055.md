Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today - I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No let's get started

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your research background. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher in an academic research setting investigating human derived induced pluripotent stem cells for use in treating neurological disorders, specifically spinal cord injury. The most recent research project that I have worked on involved transcriptomic analyses of in vivo experiments to identify genes that are upregulated by stem cell transplantation. Following that, we transfected stem cells to ectopically express the candidate genes, validated that the stem cells are viable and can differentiate into neural cell types in vitro, and then tested the cells in a rodent model of disease. Throughout the experiment, I collected behavioural data to assess functional performance, and then collected tissue after sacrificing the animal for immunohistochemistry and transcriptomic analyses.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive project spanning multiple methodologies. The progression from transcriptomic analysis to in vitro validation to in vivo testing with behavioral outcomes is quite involved.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I have tested using AI for getting a preliminary sense of the role that individual genes play and what pathways they are involved in, though I always ask the AI to cite their sources as some of the claims are unsubstantiated. In terms of transcriptomic analyses, I have attempted to use AI to troubleshoot issues I had with writing code in R when using new packages to perform differential gene , string, and WGCNA analyses.

AI: Interesting - so you're using AI both for background research on gene function and for coding support. Let's focus on one of those areas first.

For the gene function research, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for getting that preliminary understanding.

User: For literature reviews, it is sometimes difficult to find relevant papers or miss key publications, but AI seems to be able to find key words that are able to help locate these articles, whether it be function, pathways, or even the name of researchers who publish in this field. However, it is important to check every source as many of them don't exist (are hallucinated) and sometimes, the claims that the AI model makes are not supported by the paper it cited.

AI: That's a really practical insight about AI helping with search terms and researcher identification, while being clear-eyed about the hallucination risks. 

Tell me more about that verification process - when AI gives you information about gene function or pathways with citations, how do you go about checking whether those claims are actually supported?

User: I use the AI as a preliminary tool to identify the gene names and to get some initial citations. I then go through these citations, verifying if they are real, support the claims that AI made, and check the study design for reliability. Following that, I also conduct my own searches through Pubmed or web of science with the key words I've now identified to get a better idea of research in the field as well as a consensus of the literature.

AI: That's a really methodical approach - using AI as a starting point but then doing your own verification and expanded search. It sounds like you've developed a clear workflow around this.

Now thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like the behavioral data collection, the immunohistochemistry, or other aspects of your workflow - what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: For data collection, it is difficult to implement AI as those are practical experiments without needing any analysis. For immunohistochemistry however, there is the addition of AI to some of the analysis programs out there. However, there is always a licensing cost issue which would limit their use depending on the lab and research institute that one is working at. For me, I currently do not have access to these programs, though I have heard good things about their usability.

AI: That makes sense - the distinction between practical experimental work and analysis is clear, and the licensing cost barrier is something I hadn't considered.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious about one more area - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be very helpful if AI could be used to assess the reliability/quality of research papers by looking at whether the authors used any shortcuts, conducted robust experiments with strong statistical reliability, and whether there are any concerns with the animal models they used (not replicable results, variability in function etc). Some of these things may not be well known or published information so when people from outside the field read these papers, it may be difficult for them to assess whether the findings are reliable.

AI: That's a fascinating idea - essentially having AI serve as a methodological quality assessment tool that could flag potential issues with study design or model limitations that might not be obvious to researchers outside that specific field.

It sounds like there's a real challenge in evaluating the reliability of work across different specialized areas, especially when some of the concerns about models or methods might be domain knowledge that isn't explicitly stated in papers.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a starting point for literature discovery while maintaining rigorous verification practices, and especially your insight about the need for methodological quality assessment, were particularly valuable. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No that should be it.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that systematic verification workflow - using AI to identify keywords and researchers, then validating each citation and doing your own expanded searches - really help us understand how researchers are thoughtfully integrating these tools while maintaining scientific rigor.

Your point about the need for AI-assisted quality assessment of research methodology was especially thought-provoking, particularly how domain-specific knowledge about model limitations often isn't explicit in papers.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
