Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, sounds fun! Let's get started.

AI: Great! I'm excited to hear about your experiences.

To start us off, could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use AI for coding. At my day job I often end up having to complete tasks that include as frontend/web development - Using AI speeds up that process considerably, especially since I'm not an expert on frontend development.

I also use AI to complete administrative and clerical coding tasks such as writing VBS scripts, renaming files, refactoring functions and so on. 

Very rarely, I also use AI to assist in writing tasks such as for technical reports or API documentations. I usually prefer doing this myself since I enjoy writing, but I've started incorporating AI into my workflow to speed up my tasks.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found AI helpful across different aspects of your development work. You mentioned that you're not an expert in frontend development - tell me more about how AI changes that experience for you. What's it like working on frontend tasks now compared to before you had AI assistance?

User: I've studied Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in college - this made me well versed with things like hosting language models, using the OpenAI API, prompt engineering and so on. However, I did not study frontend or web development in depth, which means when I need to complete tasks that involve a lot of HTML/CSS/Javascript, I'm quite lost. AI has helped me tremendously in this aspect - I no longer need to know exactly how to implement the ideas in my head. As long as I can visualize and verbalize what I want, AI tools are quite good at converting all that into code.

That's not to say there aren't challenges. I often have to go back and forth quite a bit, iterating until I'm happy with the outcome. But this is still far better than having to go through pages and pages of documentation and struggling with changing parameters manually which is how I used to work before I had AI assistance.

AI: That back-and-forth process you described sounds really important to how you work with AI. When you're iterating until you're happy with the outcome, what does that process typically look like? Are you making tweaks and adjustments together, or are you more giving it feedback and having it regenerate things?

User: A mix of both. It usually stems from my initial instructions not being specific enough. For example, I remember an instance where I asked GPT-4o for a "modern, card-based layout" for one of the modules in our application. Since these instructions weren't specific, it came up with a result that was technically correct, even though it wasn't what I was looking for. If the result was way off, I'd just start over, but if the result was close enough and just needed minor tweaks, I'd give it a bit of feedback and ask it to fix it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've developed a feel for when something is worth refining versus starting fresh. You mentioned earlier that there are certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help - particularly with writing tasks since you enjoy writing. What makes those tasks different for you? What draws you to keep doing the writing yourself?

User: There's two main reasons for this:

Firstly, I've always enjoyed writing since I was young. I feel like writing is a place where someone can really "express" themselves, and I like using my own little quirks (such as the Oxford comma) in my writing. AI takes this away, and although I could instruct it to write in my style, it just wouldn't feel the same as if I'd written it myself. I also feel a sense of "closeness" to the text if I've written it myself. Apart from sentimental value, this also has practical reasons - for example if my boss asks me to tweak something - I know exactly what to change and where instead of having to go through AI again, since I'd written the piece myself.

The second reason is that I do not like the way most AI-written pieces read. Since I work with AI extensively, I can spot AI writing -- more specifically, ChatGPT -- from quite far away. I get really annoyed when I find people using AI even for basic tasks such as sending a Teams message or writing a short email. It surely takes longer to use AI to do those tasks compared to just doing it themselves, but people have become so dependent on AI that they just can't help themselves. This is another reason why I try to avoid using AI for writing. It's an entirely personal reason that even makes me seem a bit judgmental, but that's that.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - both the personal connection to your own writing and your observations about how others use AI. You touched on something interesting about people becoming dependent on AI even for quick tasks. When you use AI for coding tasks, how do you think about maintaining your own skills in those areas? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm going to be honest, and I know this makes me sound like a hypocrite, but even I've become dependent on AI for the menial coding tasks that I use it for. I remember building an entire Android application from scratch back in 2020 - way before AI become so accessible, and I honestly don't think I could do that anymore. 

I also don't really think about maintaining my own skills that much. I use AI in a collaborative manner, which means it's still me doing the work, while AI just assists me. I'm still very much maintaining my skills even though I'm using AI. A question I sometimes ask is whether I'd still be able to function at work if ChatGPT went down, and the answer is yes, although not as effectively.

AI: That's really honest of you to share, and I don't think it makes you hypocritical at all - it sounds like you're very aware of the trade-offs. You mentioned using AI in a collaborative manner where it's still you doing the work. Can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? How do you and the AI divide up the work on a given task?

User: Sure! So today I was working on a JSON parser for FHIR-spec files. The way JSON files work is that as long as you know the "keys", you can extract their "values". Since I've been working on these files for a bit, I knew the keys I wanted extracted, so I fed those into GPT-4o and had it generate the code for me. The "idea" behind the implementation as well as the details were all provided by me, but it was AI that did the actual coding.

AI: That's a really clear example of that collaborative approach - you bringing the domain knowledge and implementation strategy while AI handles the actual code generation. You mentioned earlier that your workplace culture or colleagues might influence how you use AI. How has that played out in your experience? Do you find your team talks about AI use, or does it influence your approach in any way?

User: I work in Research and Development department, which means basically everyone uses AI on a regular basis. The people around me use all sorts of AI tools from Grammarly to Copilot, and are constantly discussing about AI and how to effectively use it for our work. I'm a bit more "traditional" in the sense that I stick with GPT-4o since I've been using it for quite some time now,  but it's interesting talking with my team about all the other tools and their capabilities.

AI: That sounds like a really open environment for AI experimentation. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There is one instance that comes to mind. I was working on a web application for a structured report writer, and there was an element of the UI that wasn't functioning the way it was supposed to. You remember how I mentioned that I'm not good at frontend development? Yeah, I had heavily used AI to create the frontend of this application, which meant that I had no clue how to fix the UI issue that was happening. I tried my best to explain the issue and even provide screenshots, however I was not able to solve it and ended up having to delegate this task to one of our frontend engineers. This was an experience that made me frustrated, since in my head I knew what I wanted, but my limited knowledge of frontend development led to me being unable to collaboratively solve this issue using AI.

AI: That's a really insightful example - it highlights how the collaborative approach has its limits when the technical knowledge gap gets too wide. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular direction?

User: Honestly, the capabilities of AI and the speed at which they were progressing was starting to become a bit scary. It made me feel very replaceable, which in turn pushed me to work harder so that I could highlight my work to the higher ups in the company. However, over the past couple of months the breakthroughs appear to have slowed down, so I feel a bit more secure in my job now. The tasks I do are still not fully automate-able, so as of now it seems that my relationship with AI will remain the same - using it as a collaborative tool to complete my tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the balance between collaboration and dependency, and how honest you were about both the benefits and the challenges you've encountered.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI use, the challenges with knowledge gaps, and your honest reflections on dependency will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
