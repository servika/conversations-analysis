Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments, and anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

Assuming you're ready to start – could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to assist me in writing treatment plans for patients at a counseling agency.

AI: That sounds like really important work. Could you walk me through what that looks like in practice? When you're creating a treatment plan, how exactly does AI assist you in that process?

User: Generally, I provide some information about the presenting problems and the goals the patient wants to achieve and ask the AI to assist me with suggestions of different objectives to work on in order to reach those goals. That is the main aspect for which I use AI at my work. I also sometimes will provide some text and request a rewrite from the AI assistant for increased clarity.

AI: That's really helpful context. I'm curious about your decision-making process here. When you're working on treatment plans, are there parts of that work that you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even though AI could potentially help with those aspects too?

User: There aren't really any parts that I choose to work on myself by preference, but I am limited in the information I can provide the AI due to privacy concerns. For that reason, there are some aspects that I am required to work on myself without the assistance of an AI assistant.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - privacy considerations would definitely create those boundaries. When you are able to use AI within those constraints, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more collaborating back and forth with the AI as you develop the treatment plan, or do you tend to give it the information you can share and have it generate suggestions that you then work with independently?

User: A bit of both. I usually will provide the information and request some suggestions. Then, if needed, I will collaborate with the AI to fine tune the results.

AI: That's interesting - you have that flexible approach depending on what you need. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in this work? Have there been discussions about it, or policies that shaped how you approach using it?

User: I work from home so the interactions with my co-workers are minimal. We have not really discussed using AI specifically. We do have very strict confidentiality policies that regulate the information that we share and this applies to every situation and every medium. I think it is an unspoken understanding that it applies to AI as well.

AI: That makes sense - those existing confidentiality frameworks would naturally extend to AI interactions. Can you share a time when using AI for treatment planning made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It is not a singular event, but rather a recurring situation. One of the therapists I write treatment plans for is very unclear in his writing and it is often difficult to decipher what he is actually trying to convey. The AI assistant has been very helpful in helping me clarify the meaning of some information he provides in paperwork. It has drastically improved the amount of time I have to spend on his treatment plans.

AI: That sounds like a real game-changer for your efficiency with that particular therapist's work. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it factor into how you approach your work?

User: I think when it comes to mental health, a human touch will always be necessary. I don't think AI could completely take over. Because of that, I don't think it really factors into how I approach my work other than to help with efficiency.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on the human element in mental health work. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular ways?

User: I don't see it changing very much in the short term due to the limitations imposed by privacy considerations. I think it would be helpful if an assistant could scan the information from intake paperwork and input the relevant information in the client's file, but that would necessitate some robust safeguards to prevent leaks of PII. I don't think we are quite ready for that yet.

AI: That's really insightful - the potential for more automated data processing balanced against those crucial privacy protections. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in treatment planning work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with efficiency while recognizing the irreplaceable human element in mental health care.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI within the constraints of healthcare privacy requirements, and how it's helping you work more efficiently with challenging documentation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
