Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use it pretty sparsely mainly for things that would take far to long other wise and wouldn't add enough value to be worth it. I use it to expand the backgrounds on images to make them fit better in pamphlets and news letters and some times to check if the tone of my work is what I think it it.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're very selective about when to bring AI into your workflow. 

When you mention checking the tone of your work, can you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: I'll ask the AI to review a portion of text I wrote and ask it what it thinks the tone of the piece is. I'm autistic so tone is some times hard for me to navigate especially when I'm trying to create something hopeful but still making the need for donations clear since I work at a nonprofit.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a sounding board for tone when you're balancing those different messaging goals sounds really practical.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it sparingly for specific situations. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Most tasks I can finish more effectively on my own. AI still has a lot of small glitches in it that in a work space make me wary to use it for anything to important. I need to make sure any material we are putting out is 100 percent correct and validated and I have a masters degree in library science focusing on research so for me in particular It's often much quicker for me to find it myself. I also do worry about the impact of AI on the environment - so unless it feels like a real boon to me it doesn't feel necessary to use.

AI: That's really thoughtful - it sounds like you weigh several factors when deciding whether to use AI, from accuracy concerns to environmental impact.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to only give AI final polishing tasks - tone checks, extending an image to better fit into a newsletter, or formatting checks for things like grant proposals. I choose to relegate it only things that would both take a great amount of time to do by hand, and also do not add enough to the work to be worth that time. Spending an hour trying to match the photo background just to make it an inch wider isn't worth while but having the AI expand it in a moment is well worth my time.

AI: That's a really clear framework - focusing on time-intensive tasks that don't add substantial value to the core work. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or approaches around you?

User: Most of the people at my work don't really understand what AI is from what I've seen. They either avoid it because they don't understand it or end up using it in ways that create more work - like having it do research for them and not checking that it gave them some very poor sources or having it create images that look to uncanny to use.  Overall though the organization doesn't really have a stance on it from what I've seen.

AI: It sounds like you've found a middle ground that works for you while seeing others struggle with how to use it effectively.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was really happy when AI was able to extend the background of an image of our board of directors to make it fit perfectly on the news letter. It saved me a ton of time and added that nice finished look that really got a lot of praise from my boss and colleges.  The most frustrating thing I ran into while using AI was when it attempts to create something outside what I asked - some times when I ask it to fix formatting issues it will also change the sentences around and that isn't what I wanted and it gets annoying having to check again and again.

AI: That formatting example really highlights the importance of AI staying within the boundaries of what you actually requested. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I personally believe we need to have AI stay in it's lane so to speak - grammar checking, information gathering, minor photo edits are fine but having it create art and creative works feels more like stealing with how it currently works - it's just taking what other people have done and rehashing it. I do keep up on my skills even where AI might take over because AI will never be infallible in our lifetime. It's a tool to me like a computer was, or a type writer was in the day - Computers didn't get rid of mathematicians they just made them able to do more and that is where I see AI going in the best possible future.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on AI as a tool that augments rather than replaces human capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine it will. As AI changes and becomes more reliable and hopefully able to run on less energy like most tech does as it grows it will become more viable for me to use it in an ethical way that adds value to my work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI as a tool that should augment rather than replace human skills, and how you've developed such a clear framework for when it's worth using versus when it's not.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI selectively and thoughtfully, especially considering factors like accuracy, environmental impact, and maintaining professional skills, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and limitations you've encountered. Have a great rest of your day!
