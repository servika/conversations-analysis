Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. I don't have any questions right now.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Right now, I largely use AI to help research different topics. One common use case for me, as a resident astronomer at a local museum, is to use it to research what will be in the sky for the upcoming week to be included in a "stargazing" section of our weekly newsletter. I've ended up making an API integration in a custom GPT on ChatGPT, because the web search wasn't very accurate.

Sometimes I have also used ChatGPT to troubleshoot different things, such as our planetarium projectors when they were either broken or there were configuration issues. This was the most use I got out of a chatbot at work, as I had a lot of trouble finding relevant documents and answers for my questions using a traditional search engine.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found some quite specific applications for AI in your astronomy work. 

Tell me more about that API integration you created for the stargazing newsletter. What wasn't working well with the web search, and how did building that custom solution change your workflow?

User: A lot of the sources it was referencing were articles from the previous year about the sky for the relevant week, which would be inaccurate about everything except the positions of constellations. It's because very few websites publish weekly stargazing forecasts that far in advance (for when I need to write them), so ChatGPT was only finding older articles with a web search. 

Using astronomyapi.com allowed me to have ChatGPT query the locations of different celestial objects on specific dates and times as viewed from my specific location, giving me accurate data without needing to rely on when other websites publish their forecasts. The integration still did not always work perfectly, though, as sometimes ChatGPT would have issues filling out specific parameters and getting the security key to work was a pain.

AI: That's a clever solution - going directly to the data source rather than relying on published forecasts. It sounds like you had to work through some technical challenges though.

When you were troubleshooting those planetarium projector issues, what made AI more helpful than traditional search in that situation? What was different about how you could interact with it compared to searching through manuals or support documentation?

User: ChatGPT just seemed to be able to find more relevant results for what I was troubleshooting than I was able to using Google search, and it also saved me the time of having to go through multiple pages of results myself. It was also helpful in that it compiled different troubleshooting methods from several sites. Being able to quickly follow-up on a specific troubleshooting option and have it search for more details on it was also very convenient.

AI: That follow-up capability sounds really valuable - being able to have that back-and-forth conversation about the troubleshooting steps.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I don't use AI to do anything related to analyzing our financial data from the museum because I consider that somewhat sensitive information and want it to end up in the training data for ChatGPT or potentially accessible by other parties (either OpenAI or any other actors).

I also always write my own articles and stuff like that because I don't think most AI writing sounds good to me (and I can typically very easily spot when someone else has used it for writing). Unlike coding, where starting with an AI generated baseline to edit makes the process a lot easier, I think the amount of editing required for me to be satisfied with AI generated written content means it's easier just to write it from scratch myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the sensitivity concerns around financial data and your preference for your own writing voice.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would say I usually have it complete small tasks. To be honest, the astronomy research and the troubleshooting is the only things I have really used AI for in my day job (aside from occasionally having it write code), where I usually have it complete those specific tasks and then I use those responses to complete the larger task myself (i.e. whatever I'm doing with the code, or writing the portion of the newsletter, etc.). I would say troubleshooting specifically was more collaborative in nature, though.

AI: That distinction between the different tasks is interesting - more collaborative for troubleshooting but more task-oriented for the astronomy research.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yeah sometimes I read emails or captions that get posted on the website and can tell they are AI and it somewhat annoys me. I, personally, think the common style of AI-generated writing makes it all seem fairly generic, and I also don't like seeing it on our pages because I know when I notice AI generate content on other webpages, I usually just stop reading because of the rampant quality issues with AI generate content on the web. I just think it's a bad look. Though, to be fair, I work with AI a lot outside of my day job and am probably better at spotting the stuff than most.

AI: It sounds like your broader experience with AI outside of work has really shaped how you think about its use at your museum - both in terms of what you can spot and what concerns you about quality.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was particularly satisfied that ChatGPT was able to help me troubleshoot the projectors, as the people who actually installed the things were absolutely no help with their customer service and kinda ghosted us. I was very frustrated when ChatGPT couldn't find up to date stargazing forecasts and trying to set up the API (again, the security key was a pain to get working), but satisfied with myself when I finally got it to work.

AI: That projector troubleshooting situation sounds like AI really came through when human support failed you. And it's interesting how the API frustration turned into satisfaction once you worked through the technical challenges.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: To some extent, sure. I think AI has real potential to take over in data analysis, based on its demonstrated capabilities, but am not terribly worried about that until locally hosted servers become more common, as security concerns will likely (or at least, should) prevent AI from being used from analyzing stuff like financial data. With other tasks, I am still doubtful AI will reach a point where it can do stuff unsupervised, at least for a long time, so I plan to incorporate it more rather than being worried about my own skills.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - the distinction between what AI might be capable of versus what organizations will actually allow it to do, especially around sensitive data.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Due to my own duties, I don't think it will change terribly much from what it already is. Like I said, if we had a secure local server, I would use it more in data analysis, but that's the only use case I can see changing. If it gets better at research, what I use it for currently would just end up requiring less effort on my end than it does now.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the security considerations around sensitive data and how that shapes what tasks you're willing to use AI for.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of integrating AI into specialized work like astronomy, the technical challenges you've worked through, and your thoughtful approach to security considerations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
