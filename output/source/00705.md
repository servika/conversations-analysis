Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions, I'm good to go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I run a private catering company and teach cooking classes at a local Italian Supermarket chain. I use AI to help me with menu descriptions and formatting for catering events. I also use it to prepare recipes and cookbooks that I send to students of the classes, as well as the class descriptions for ticket sales on eventbrite.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across several different aspects of your food business. 

When you're working on those menu descriptions for catering events, what does that process typically look like? Are you starting from scratch with AI, or do you come to it with ideas already in mind?

User: The menu is set by myself in collaboration with the client before it ever reaches the AI. Once the client has approved a menu for their event, I bring it to the model and provide suggestions for how I would like it written. For example, in the last month we have catered a release party for a rock album, a gender reveal party, and a more traditional wedding. The writing style for each event was significantly different and customized to the situation. I always make it very clear to the model that I do not want any advice or suggestions in relation to the menu items or food, the work is strictly on the writing and formatting of the menu itself.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction you make - keeping the creative menu decisions firmly in your hands while using AI specifically for the presentation aspect. 

Tell me more about how you communicate those different writing styles to the model. When you had that rock album release party versus the traditional wedding, what kinds of directions did you give to get the tone right for each event?

User: For the release party, we came up with edgy, silly names for the dishes, and incorporated the band members names whenever possible. For example we did a Caeser Salad called "Geezer Salad" (the members are all over 60) and changed the Hollandaise Sauce used on the steak to "Benny Sauce" (As in "eggs benedict" and the drummer, Benjamin). We also allocated a short joke or description to each item.

For the wedding, everything was written in a more professional tone, with more elegant descriptors (silky, rich, etc). The names of the menu items were short and there was no excess information outside of the ingredients themselves.

AI: That's such a creative approach - I love how you transformed "Caesar" to "Geezer" and worked in the drummer's name with the Hollandaise. 

When you're giving the AI these style directions, do you find yourself having to go back and forth with it much to get the tone just right, or does it usually nail the style you're looking for on the first try?

User: I'm pretty particular. I usually try to get a few options for everything, and pick the parts I like. Then I make a draft, and get the model to refine it and provide opinions. 

Very rarely have I taken something on the first go (even if I like it, I'd prefer to have options)

AI: That makes a lot of sense - treating it more like having multiple drafts to choose from rather than expecting one perfect result.

When you say you get the model to "provide opinions" on your draft, what kind of feedback are you looking for at that stage? Is it more about catching inconsistencies, or are you asking for different types of input?

User: I like to make sure that things are clear and appropriate for the event I'm doing. Sometimes, as a chef, we forget that people don't necessarily know what things like brodo, bianco, veloute etc mean. I want everything to be accessible. 

I also like the model to review the quality of the writing itself. Sometimes I write in a "stream of consciousness" type way, and it needs to be refined. I actually really appreciate the models for that - I can just write what I feel and let them clean it up afterwards. 

For things like recipes and booklets for classes, it's very important to me that it's written in my voice. I want the students to feel like it's coming from me personally. So i usually show the model previous things I have sent them so it can emulate my voice.

AI: That's really thoughtful - both making sure the culinary terms are accessible and maintaining that personal connection with your students. 

When you're working on getting the model to write in your voice for those student materials, how do you know when it's captured your voice versus when it still feels too "AI-like"? What are the telltale signs that help you recognize when it sounds like you?

User: People at my classes like that I don't pander and try to put on a personality. I'm not one of those psycho TV chefs, but I speak to students as if they were employees and am pretty blunt/curt. I occasionally express pretty strong opinions about certain food products. I also try to incorporate a lot of humor. However, we are ALWAYS positive and encouraging. 

Sometimes, they models will make me sound TOO kind, which is probably appropriate most of the time, but it doesn't match my voice. It will also reel a joke in sometimes if it's "on the edge", and I'll evaluate it. 

I've been known to occasionally let a curse word or a dirty joke slip out at classes, and to be honest, we've started leaning in to it. We find today's culture appreciates a more real experience.

AI: That's such an authentic approach - it sounds like your students really connect with that realness rather than a polished, sanitized persona.

When the model pulls back on those edgier jokes or tries to make you sound "too kind," how do you push it back toward your actual voice? Do you give it specific examples of what to put back in, or do you have other ways of steering it?

User: I'll usually evaluate it side by side. Like I said, I type pretty freely in my drafts and sometimes write something that would never make the final cut. If I really like something, and the model cuts it, I'll either ask it to put it back in or do it myself for the final deliverable (I always go over the final final product manually). 

I find the most consistent model edits to be on sarcastic remarks, so I'll usually let them know that they can leave some of that stuff in. I'm pretty cautious with it though, sarcasm is one of those things that models tend to really overdo. I only include it if it feels natural and appropriate.

AI: That balance with sarcasm sounds tricky - you want it to feel natural but not forced or overdone.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Menu planning. It would be very easy to tell the model the event, group size, food type etc and just let it go. But as a chef, this is something that I can never see myself giving up entirely. Especially since we try to put our own twist on everything. We don't think an event is special if you can google the dishes and find them easily. 

Occasionally, I'll ask for idea inspiration, but I can't ever see myself using a model generated menu.

AI: That makes complete sense - the creative menu planning is really the heart of what makes your catering unique and personal.

When you do ask for idea inspiration, what does that interaction typically look like? Are you looking for ingredient combinations, cooking techniques, or something else entirely?

User: It really depends on the situation. For example, I was doing a thing during the calgary stampede that we wanted to tie in to Canada Day, and try to have each dish themed after a city or province or territory. So I would say things like, give me 10 dishes unique to Iqaluit, or what are the most popular dishes in Winnipeg, what ingredients are unique to PEI, etc

Then I look at the results, and see if anything jumps out at me. There are times where I see a dish and immediately want to do something with. For that particular event, I got inspired by the Jiggs Dinner suggested by the model, so we took that and created a slider that had salt beef between a blueberry duff bun.

AI: What a brilliant twist on Jiggs dinner - turning it into a slider with the blueberry duff as the bun! That's exactly the kind of creative transformation that shows why you keep the menu planning close to yourself.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Like I said before, it's always a collaboration. If it's recipe cards or books, I have them all ready to go and just get the model to format. If it's class writeups, I slap something together and go back and forth. If it's a menu, I give it the items, decisions made by the host, and my thoughts on style/formatting. 

But I always touch up the final deliverables myself.

AI: That collaborative approach comes through really clearly - you're staying hands-on throughout the whole process rather than just handing things off.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other people in the catering business or at the supermarket chain talk about using these tools?

User: I'm constantly looking at other companies menus' and seeing what people are doing, what I like, what I don't etc. Same for other cooking classes in my city. 

When I see that something is clearly just copy pasted from an AI model I get put off. To me, personality shows care and pride. If you aren't putting any effort in to your menus or website, can I trust you to care about the food you put out? I talk about this with other chefs all the time - so many of them like to just hammer out the writeups with AI so they can get back in the kitchen. 

I use AI as a shortcut to get the non-food related stuff done, but I still focus on making sure it's on-brand and most guests would find it natural. 

I see so many of those strange ghost kitchens and satellite spots that you generally want to avoid. If something feels too AI, you get the impression it might be one of those spots.

AI: That's such an insightful perspective - you're viewing menu writing as a quality signal that extends to the food itself. When you see those obviously AI-generated menus, what specifically tips you off that it's just copy-pasted rather than thoughtfully crafted?

User: Sometimes it's just intuitive, if it feels like there isn't much thought or creativity in the menu then there probably isn't. Exclamation points and emojis are usually a dead giveaway, especially with menu descriptions. They feel unnatural, and models love them. 

Other times, things are far too descriptive. If I see a salad with Luscious, Silky Dressing, Crunchy Croutons, Smoky Bacon, Crisp Lettuce and Tangy Parmesan I get suspicious.

AI: That overly descriptive style is such a clear tell - "luscious, silky" everything does sound like AI getting carried away with adjectives.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I always get frustrated when making dough recipe books. I'll have a big list of recipes in bakers percentages that I want converted to a set size, and I've learned the hard way that I need to double check every recipe provided by the model or just do it myself beforehand. Especially if I am using eggs and want the eggs represented as a water content (which I provide and am very clear about). 

I felt very satisfied when I used AI to create a 12 tab Google Doc that I give to guests on a QR code. It has dozens of recipes and write ups, and AI was a huge help in getting it all done. It's a big feature of the classes.

AI: That's such a great example of both the limitations and the real value. The math errors on recipe conversions must be incredibly frustrating when precision is so important.

For that 12-tab Google Doc project that turned out so well - what made AI particularly helpful there? Was it the sheer volume of content, or were there specific aspects of organizing and writing that it excelled at?

User: Honestly just the time saving aspect. I had a format I liked, so I would just provide it and then go back and forth a few times until I was happy. Saved me many hours of work.

AI: That makes perfect sense - having a clear format and being able to iterate quickly rather than starting from scratch each time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I mean, I guess there are McDonalds vending machines in Japan and hot dog robots haha. But I think in general, people will always appreciate cooking their own food and it will always be a hobby for people. 

A big percentage of my clientele are people who have tried to make something following an online guide and struggled. 

For the hands on cooking aspect, I'm not too concerned. It's more artificial competition and marketing that is a struggle.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - the hands-on cooking and teaching skills remain uniquely human, but the competition from AI-generated content in marketing is the real concern.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the tools develop, or do you think you'll stick with this collaborative approach?

User: Even if I had full trust in the model, I think I would need to keep things collaborative as a creative output. I look cooking, and I like creating dishes. If I was just plugging requests in to a machine and following recipes, I'd probably do something else.

AI: That really captures the essence of it - the creative process is what makes the work meaningful for you, not just the end result.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI-generated content can signal a lack of care that extends beyond just the writing to the food itself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
