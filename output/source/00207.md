Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes that sounds great.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently I have a very limited use of AI. I will use it to create spreadsheet templates, draft emails that I want worded in a more specific tone, and do light research.

AI: That's helpful to understand your current usage. When you mention using AI for light research, could you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: I typically only use it for beginning stages. A lot of times I'm looking up contact information, or a general type of business, or a certain type of contract. I ask for a list that fits in my parameters. For example when I'm reaching out to businesses in a certain area, I will ask for suggestions with the caveat of whatever type of business I'm looking for and include a region. I also always follow up by asking the list to be placed into an Excel sheet.

AI: That's a really clear picture of how you're using it for research. It sounds like you're using AI as a starting point to generate leads and organize them efficiently.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anything legal based or creative I typically want to handle myself. I'm not comfortable with AI's current knowledge base of legal matters. So I may ask AI to generate a basic contract format that I can then feel in with my own information. Especially because jurisdictions differ wildly on legal matters. I also wish that AI could confirm business hours and contact information, but at this time, I'm still receiving a lot of businesses that are permanently closed or aren't related to the area I'm asking about or have improper information so I still have to go in and do a manual search of all businesses requested. Lastly, for creative, I think I'd really rather keep that to myself. I like being creative, and I also worry about some of the scraping tools that AI use so that my creative works could potentially be placed in a database or system that is then regurgitated to other humans asking similar questions to the creative material I've created.

AI: That's really insightful - you've identified some clear boundaries based on both practical limitations and personal values. The legal jurisdiction issue and the inaccurate business information problem you mentioned sound particularly frustrating.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I always cooperate with it. It typically starts with one of the requests I listed above, and then I'll reformat or pick out the most important pieces then come back to AI to further refine it. So if I ask for business information, and I then decide on a business to reach out to, I will then come back to AI to help draft a generic email template that I can use, and I'll work with it to ensure that everything I need is included.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like you've developed a pretty iterative workflow with AI. You start broad, then narrow down, then come back to refine further based on what you've learned.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I am a freelancer so my AI work isn't affected nor affects other workers.

AI: Ah, that's an important distinction - being a freelancer definitely gives you complete autonomy over how you integrate AI into your work processes.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I feel particularly satisfied really anytime that I'm creating Excel spreadsheets. The data is usually transferred really well so that it doesn't take much formatting if any to get to the final product. This is similarly how I feel with email refinement. I input phrases or paragraphs that I feel like aren't completely well-written, and I can usually get a better output that can almost be copied and pasted which is really helpful for time management. As far as frustrating, it's definitely research businesses. I most described this above, but it ends up creating extra work for me typically especially when 90% of the businesses on the list are not an appropriate suggestion so not only am I researching a number of businesses that are not helpful, but I also then have to go do my own research for a new list of businesses and start all over.

AI: That contrast is really striking - the Excel and email tasks sound like they're genuine time-savers for you, while the business research actually creates more work than doing it manually from the start.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's something I've considered, but a lot of my business is networking and talking with other people. So the only part I feel like that could be taken over with AI is the routine maintenance and admin work which as a freelancer actually protects my business more than anything because it gives me more time to do the actual business work of networking and working with clients instead of sitting in front of a computer all day.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're viewing AI as freeing you up to focus on the high-value, relationship-building aspects of your work that can't be automated.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm hopeful that AI gets better at research and more up-to-date so that I don't have to worry as much about asking for local business contact information. Similar to how I can do a Google search and a business will pop up but more detailed and accessible with AI. I also hope that I can learn more tools that will allow for integration for example if I'm using a work app on my phone, I want to be able to be supported by AI throughout not just necessarily when I go to an AI model for support. Last, I want more privacy protections which would allow for me to work more with AI as a writer and confidentiality protections that allow for me to have AI organize and maintain client information and updates as well.

AI: Those are really practical wishes - better data accuracy, seamless integration into your existing tools, and stronger privacy protections that would let you expand into areas you currently avoid.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've identified the boundaries between what works well for you with AI versus what doesn't, and your perspective on AI as a tool that can protect your business by freeing up time for relationship-building.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of AI integration - both where it succeeds and where it falls short - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective as a freelancer and how you've thoughtfully carved out the right balance for your work. Have a great rest of your day!
