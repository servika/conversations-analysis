Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a web developer and I normally use AI for repetitive tasks such as creating duplicates of pages with certain information or keywords being changed, creating metadata such as page titles and descriptions, and creating filler content for clients that are not sure what they want on their pages. I currently do not use AI for any creative tasks.

AI: That's interesting that you draw a clear line around creative work. 

Tell me more about those repetitive tasks - when you're creating those page duplicates or metadata, how does that typically work? Do you give the AI specific templates to follow, or does it work differently?

User: Yes, for the page duplicates I will upload a HTML file and give the AI details on the keywords that need to be contained in each page, I do this when creating "local area pages" which is an SEO method. So for example I will upload a page named "window-cleaning-woolwich.html" and give the AI a list of 6 other areas, the AI will then change the name in the URL and anywhere "woolwich" was mentioned in the content of that page. The AI will then send me back a .ZIP file containing all of these pages. This saves me a lot of time and it's very boring work doing it manually, sometimes I create sites that have around 30 of these pages. 

For metadata I will show the AI the page and ask for SEO friendly metadata that incorporates the keywords and subject of the page.

AI: That sounds like a real time-saver, especially with 30 pages at once. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you don't use it for creative tasks - are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Honestly I just prefer to do the creative stuff myself, if I need to create a logo or a flyer for a client I will create it myself in Photoshop, I would never use AI for that. I have being designing and creating things my entire life and I enjoy it. I also feel it will be more original and unique if I create it myself, and I believe that currently I can create better work than most AI models. At the moment I only use AI for boring repetitive tasks as a time saver.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's clearly something meaningful about that creative process for you.

When you are using AI for those repetitive tasks like the local area pages, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it all the instructions upfront and let it handle the complete task independently?

User: I just give it the the information upfront and it is very good at what it does, I always check the individual files for mistakes after it has sent me the .ZIP but I haven't had any issues so far. I was honestly pretty impressed the first time I tried this and it worked, it has saved me a lot of time in the past few months. 

I provide it with the keywords that need changing and a sample .HTML file and it will autonomously create as many files as I ask for and send them back to me in a .ZIP file.

AI: That's really efficient - sounds like you've found a workflow that works well for you.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other developers you work with have similar approaches, or have you seen different attitudes toward AI tools?

User: I work alone, I am self employed.

AI: Ah, got it - so you have complete freedom to decide how and when to use these tools.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was one time I had to create around 90 pages that were basically duplicates with a few keywords changed, I was working on a site where I had service pages setup using the local SEO method, for example I had pages called smart-home-installation-"areahere".html, and the same for 2 other services. Within 3 turns I managed to get AI to create all 90 pages, 30 for each service. These pages were perfect and contained no errors, I was really satisfied as this saved me hours of very boring repetitive work.  I have never had any issues with AI using this method so I can't say I have ever been frustrated with it.

I think if I tried to use it for creative purposes I would possibly encounter some frustrating situations but I have never tried in my personal work.

AI: That's a great example - 90 pages in just 3 turns is impressive. It sounds like you've really found AI's sweet spot for your work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think about this a lot but honestly it doesn't bother me too much, one day my job will probably be obsolete as AI will be able to perfectly design and craft websites for people that would normally hire me. There's nothing I can do about that so I don't let it get to me.

Luckily I have some other hands on skills I developed in my younger years I can fall back on once this happens, such as painting and decorating, handyman work, etc

AI: That's a very pragmatic perspective - accepting what you can't control while having backup plans.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll stick with this current approach of using it mainly for repetitive tasks, or might that change?

User: I think I will only ever use it for repetitive boring tasks, like I said I really enjoy completing the design process myself. I would possibly consider using it for design ideas if I was stuck, for example asking for text based descriptions of logo ideas and creating them myself.

AI: That's really helpful insight - using it as an idea generator but keeping the actual creation in your hands.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful perspectives about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've defined the boundaries of where AI fits into your workflow - using it as a powerful tool for efficiency while preserving the creative work that you find meaningful.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thanks.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI into your workflow - especially that clear distinction between efficiency tasks and creative work - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
