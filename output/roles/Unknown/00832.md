Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Okay, so I'll be talking about my day job, which actually is going through some pilot programs with AI usage to enhance our productivity. Is that what you'll be asking about?

AI: Yes, exactly! That sounds like a perfect fit for what we're exploring. The fact that your workplace is running pilot programs makes your perspective especially valuable.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, they are testing usage of AI for information presentation. Like, especially for newer baristas, it can be EXTREMELY confusing for us when we're looking for a certain recipe or information on how to do a certain task, when over the years, we've gone through rebrands and CEO changes and website changes, that it's difficult to find the correct and updated information. So, they're testing a chatbot with training data specifically with all the information, so that instead of having to find a specific document, we can ask the chatbot and get the information customized to the prompt. 

They've also been testing AI programs for scheduling shifts. One of the more controversial "tests" have been providing stores with iPad Pros with LiDAR scanners and using that in pairing with AI and computer vision to do inventory counts. It has not been very successful at our store lol.

AI: That's fascinating - you're getting to see AI tested across such different functions. The inventory scanning with LiDAR sounds particularly ambitious!

Tell me more about that information chatbot for recipes and procedures. When you use it instead of hunting through documents, how does that experience feel different for you as a barista?

User: I'm a tenured barista... maybe not tenured but I've been there for seven years parttime. I'm usually really fast with finding whatever documents or having the info offhand. However, having a chatbot does make things more streamlined instead of figuring out which key word describes the document we're trying to find and then searching "containers within containers" to find the right document THEN browsing through the document to find the info we need. It's a pretty good idea and one feedback I gave was to have the document pulled out with a link as the context for reference too.

AI: That's a smart suggestion about including the document link - sounds like you're thinking about verification and trust. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you're usually fast at finding information yourself after seven years. Are there certain tasks you still prefer to handle the traditional way, even though the chatbot could help? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Personally, I do like the process of digging for information. Yes, the process is streamlined, but there's something dopamine-filled about digging for the right piece of information and finding it yourself. There's also been times where I have found other docs in my pursuit that I've forgotten about and then I end up realizing that maybe there's a process we do at work that hasn't been updated and "we've been doing wrong." I'm also just a curious person in general, so I find it fun.

I don't usually do the inventory counts myself, but I've heard from my peers that do that it's very finicky. Of course, it's still new technology and it could also be human error. Maybe they aren't clear on how the tech works, but it could be a good idea with more tweaking.

AI: That's such an interesting point about the discovery aspect - finding those forgotten documents that reveal outdated processes. It sounds like there's real value in that serendipitous learning that happens when you're exploring.

When you do use the chatbot for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask it a specific question and then take that information to handle the rest independently?

User: It's supposed to be for one-off questions: "what are you looking for/what information do you need?" and then it'll readout the info.

AI: Got it, so it's designed as a direct lookup tool. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people embracing these pilot programs, or is there more mixed reactions?

User: Definitely mixed. While there's some people that are just nervous about the concept of AI, there are some people more open to it, especially because this isn't about the more controversial ethical points of art generation. I'm personally cautious but hopeful.

AI: That makes sense - the distinction between using AI for internal processes versus more contentious applications like art generation seems important to how people respond.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the chatbot is getting better, but I was testing it on multiple areas of questions and it mentioned using a chemical we're not supposed to use on stainless steel. I did report it, but that did reduce my trust in its truthfulness. I'll definitely be cross-referencing the docs for now lol.

AI: That's a significant moment - getting incorrect information about chemical safety would definitely shake confidence. It sounds like you handled it well by reporting it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well, as a barista, my job is very hands-on so unless they're rolling out at least 4 of those crazy expensive robots, I don't think they're coming for that part of my job just yet. I am curious if my employer will ever go the route of having AI as drive-thru greeters who take the order and we're just left to drink making.

AI: That's an interesting distinction - the physical craft skills versus the customer interaction piece. The drive-thru greeter scenario is something a lot of service industry workers are probably wondering about.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll become more comfortable with it, or will you maintain that cautious approach?

User: I'll always remain cautious. The tech is moving fast and I worry about higher-ups and reduced empathy and ethical concerns of extortion.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns about the broader implications beyond just the technology itself.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your point about the dopamine hit from discovering information yourself and how that serendipitous learning can reveal outdated processes - that's something I hadn't considered before.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really; it's still new tech, so I'm excited to see what innovations we can achieve.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between efficiency and discovery, the importance of trust and verification, and your thoughtful perspective on the broader workplace implications will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's clear you're approaching these changes with both curiosity and wisdom, which I think will serve you well as these technologies continue to evolve. Thanks again!
