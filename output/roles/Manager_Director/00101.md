Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. I do not have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a Restaurant Manager so I often use AI to help me with professional writing. For example, when I write emails to customers I often use AI to rewrite my email to make it sound more professional or when creating a Facebook/Instagram post I would use it help me generate a potential description for the post.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using AI to rewrite your emails to customers or help with social media posts, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you write a draft first and then ask AI to polish it, or do you start differently?

User: Yes, when I write emails I usually create a rough draft which I then ask the AI to polish. In terms of the social media posts my approach varies. Sometimes I create a draft which the AI then polishes, but other times I ask it to generate potential descriptions. For example, if we had an event like concert coming up, I would simply ask the AI to generate a post for that event. I would then make any necessary edits myself.

AI: That's interesting how your approach varies depending on the task. I'm curious about your decision-making process there. When you're working on a social media post, what helps you decide whether to start with your own draft versus asking AI to generate something from scratch?

User: Sometimes the posts are very similar to what we have posted before (e.g., lunch specials, 10% off for deliveries), so in that case I would often just copy what I had before and ask the AI to change it/rewrite it to make the post seem more original. When I post something new, I often start with a simple and general prompt to get an idea of what the post can look like and after some personal edits I would ask the model to touch up my edited version.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're adapting your approach based on whether it's routine content or something new. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are tasks like creating the weekly schedule for employees, modifying certain excel sheets (e.g., inventory), or creating a poster/advertisement for an event for which I would like to use AI. However, those are tasks that need my full attention and mistakes could be made easily, so it is better for me to do it myself. Similarly, when it comes to making the posters or advertisements I feel like AI still has issues with that, so it is just simpler for me to create it myself in a program like Canva.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making about tasks that need your full attention where mistakes could have real consequences. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I mainly use it for text generation or rewriting. I would never just copy an AI response and use it, I always double check it and make some edits so it is exactly how I like.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - always reviewing and personalizing the output. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or policies around AI use in your restaurant?

User: The owners actually encourage us to use AI, especially in terms of writing something like an email or a description for a post. I would say that most of my coworkers (other managers) use AI in a similar way that I do.

AI: It's great that you have that kind of supportive environment for AI use. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: As managers we don't spend that much time in the office, as we often have to be on the floor to attend to guests or in the kitchen ensuring that everything is running smoothly, so having AI assist us in this creative writing (posts and emails) is very helpful, which I would say is very satisfying. There were times i tried to use AI to generate a particular image and it did not look that good, which was pretty frustrating so I had to approach the task differently.

AI: That time pressure element really comes through - it sounds like AI helps you be more efficient when you do have those limited office moments. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No not really, I am not that worried about that in the restaurant business. Any way AI can help is great

AI: That's a refreshing perspective. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will definitely use it as much as I have been up until now, if not a bit more as AI gets better.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you adapt your approach based on whether content is routine or new, and how the time constraints of restaurant management make AI assistance so valuable for those creative writing tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope thats it. Thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into the fast-paced restaurant environment and your thoughtful approach to collaboration versus delegation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. Have a great rest of your day!
