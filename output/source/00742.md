Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will help improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I try to use it in a variety of tasks. Simple research questions about where to find things or answer questions, advice on how to handle work-related problems, and learning project management software or other skills/resources

AI: That's a nice range of uses. When you mention using AI for advice on work-related problems, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically present those problems to the AI?

User: Gladly. A primary example that comes to mind is when I am working with Project Management software such as Notion. When i'm establishing a new project in my company/organization that I run, I like to ask questions on what to incorporate in to Notion or how to incorporate features found on other Project Management software (like Burndown Charts) in to Notion via Notion Formulas, which then leads to me asking AI how to write a specific formula and to explain it to me on why that formula works or isn't working when I input it

AI: That's really helpful - I can see how that becomes this iterative process where you're not just asking for a formula, but actually working through the logic together. 

When you're in that back-and-forth with AI about the Notion formulas, do you find yourself more collaborating with it step-by-step through the problem, or do you typically give it the full context and let it handle the complete solution?

User: I think it's a mix of both. I tend to at first usually try to give it as much context as possible so it can handle the complete solution, because ideally that takes less time when it works. But usually it does not get the complete solution on its own, so I have to then go step-by-step through the original problem and other problems that arise

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - starting with the hope for efficiency but then adapting when reality kicks in. 

When you have to shift into that step-by-step mode, what's that experience like for you? Do you find that collaborative troubleshooting process valuable in some way, or is it mostly just a necessary detour from what you were trying to accomplish?

User: It can be valuable at times, but it's not common, and usually the troubleshooting process is mostly a necessary detour because it is hard to plug-in my entire Notion set-up (and existing forumlas I have in place) for AI to understand

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the AI is working with incomplete information about your actual setup. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Some higher-level story ideas I prefer to do myself for my organization (which revolves around the creative industry and game development), such as cinematic storylines. I wouldn't usually ask AI to give me ideas on what a certain trailer or cutscene should provide/develop in the overarching narrative. This is because it makes me feel like I have more ownership over it, but more importantly it's because I don't think AI would be able to provide a unique personal touch to what a story within my creative universe may be about and how it sets up future elements. But, I will ask AI for small things like a list of unique character names for the story or information about a certain time-piece that I am working with.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - keeping the core creative vision to yourself but using AI for the supporting elements. 

When you say AI wouldn't be able to provide that "unique personal touch" to your creative universe, what specifically do you think would be missing if you did delegate that higher-level storytelling to AI?

User: When it comes to more niche narrative games or storylines, I don't believe AI would have the knowledge or details to understand the lore or world of said game entirely. For example, if I am working on an indie game and it is still in development (or just released), then it won't know the complex lore and all the knitty-gritty details of what has happened in the game universe and where it is planned to go (in comparison to let's say a big Triple-A release from a series with multiple releases within the franchise already, which I would assume the AI would know a lot about already and then may be helpful there). On top of that, I wouldn't want to give all of my information to AI anyways on this.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - both the knowledge gap and the intentional boundary you set around sharing proprietary information. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others around you are approaching it similarly or differently?

User: Yes 100%. At first we would play around with small ideas on names and other ideas using AI, but some of the other creative members frowned us for doing so, stating it was unethical to use AI for brainstorming or creative outlets like writing and artwork. So now I am in an interesting position to where me and some other people are using AI discreetly without fully embracing it on a team-wide level even though it is useful

AI: That sounds like a pretty complex situation to navigate. When you're using AI "discreetly," how does that affect your experience with it? Does having to be careful about when and how you use it change the way you interact with these tools?

User: I say so. I can imagine really cool scenarios where we may even build our own AI bot that knows all of our game knowledge, so that way a creative writer or game designer can do something easily like asking the AI about the lore significance of Character 1 interacting with Character 2, rather than having to manually dig for each character's information and find out whether they like each other or not. But instead of doing that, I usually have to stick to sometimes smaller scale ways to use these AI tools like building Notion formulas or brainstorming ideas personally with just me and the AI rather than with groups

AI: That vision of a custom AI that knows your game's entire lore system sounds really powerful - like having an instant research assistant for your creative universe.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: In terms of frustration, I think a somewhat common thing that happens is when I ask AI about a specific game mechanic from another game or something potentially niche or not-so-common, and the AI will definitely say "There is no X in game" and yet when I look at human provided resources like wikipedia pages with the same exact search it will prove otherwise

AI: That's really frustrating - especially when you know the information exists and can verify it elsewhere. When that happens, does it affect how you approach AI for research tasks going forward, or do you just factor in that verification step as part of your process?

User: I still end up using AI for research tasks, but I have to take it with a large grain of salt, and it is just becomes another tool for me to cross-examine rather than the definitive research solution it has been hyped up to be

AI: That's a really honest assessment - treating it as one source among many rather than the definitive answer. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Especially given both the technical limitations you've experienced and the workplace dynamics you're navigating?

User: Ideally, I would like AI to hopefully one-day relatively soon to become the definitive research solution it has been expected to be, and that it can be something everyone wants to incorporate. But I am worried on the cultural push-back on it, and hope there are new ways to allow AI to become a part of the "social-norm" and accepted by people in the creative industry rather than have animosity towards it being used alongside them or see it as a "replacement"

AI: Those are really thoughtful insights about both the technical hopes and the cultural challenges. You've shared some fascinating perspectives on navigating AI use in a creative environment where there's real tension around its role.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your day-to-day reality with these tools?

User: Honestly nothing too notable. I do like using AI as a way for me learning new skills, but I have somewhat covered that already

AI: Perfect - you've really given me a comprehensive view of how you're using AI in your work. I particularly found your insights about the cultural tensions in creative industries fascinating, and how that's shaping not just whether people use AI, but how they use it.

Your perspective on treating AI as one research tool among many rather than a definitive source also seems like a really practical approach that others might benefit from hearing about.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thanks

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
