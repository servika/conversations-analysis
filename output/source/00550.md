Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That's fine with me! Let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently I only really use AI to help me to research various aspects of my day-to-day work. This is typically as a quicker "fact-check" where I use an assistant to give me the code or location of a certain regulation within some variation of a state's CGP (Construction General Permit) for stormwater regulation and what that regulation states. If it checks with my prior knowledge, I'm usually good there, but occasionally I'll use that code or location to find what I'm looking for quicker within the regulatory document.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a research accelerator in a pretty specialized regulatory field. 

When you say you check the AI's response against your prior knowledge, tell me more about that process. What happens when there's a mismatch between what the AI tells you and what you expected to find?

User: I verify. For instance, using Indiana's CGP, say I have a client who is contracting me to consult and inspect on their construction site ask me if they really need to include a vicinity map in their stormwater plan. I know they do, but I do not know where that regulation is specifically located in the CGP. I do know it should be in Section 4.0, which covers the stormwater plan. If I ask AI to help me find it and they state something like "Section 3.3 (a)", I know this is likely incorrect, as that section covers performance standards. I won't remember, however, that this regulation is covered by 4.1 (a) (2). Typically though, the AI will give me an accurate location, and I verify this regardless.

AI: That's a really insightful example of how you've developed a system for working with AI that leverages both its capabilities and your expertise. You're using your domain knowledge as a quality filter.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the research tasks you delegate?

User: I'm not sure if there are too many areas that could be handled by AI. The only area I could identify is SWPPP (stormwater pollution prevention plan) writing, but this is usually handled by a template, and requires getting a lot of information from various areas about new construction projects, meaning the information is not easily available for access by an AI model. The use of a template and the specificity of each unique site also would make difficult for AI in its current form to assist, but I would say that is the most likely area it could handle. Long story short, complex task, use of AI would not simplify.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like SWPPP writing involves synthesizing very site-specific information that's scattered across different sources and stakeholders, which would be challenging for AI to access and coordinate.

When you use AI for those regulatory research tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout your research, or do you tend to ask it a specific question and then take that information to verify independently?

User: I typically ask specific questions and verify independently. I have the entire CGP of each state I work in printed out in my work vehicle, so once AI tells me where the regulation should be, it does not take me long to verify it.

AI: That's really practical - having those physical documents right there for quick verification. It sounds like you've developed a pretty streamlined workflow.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your field approach AI similarly, or have you noticed different attitudes or approaches?

User: Our upper management encourages the use of AI to make emails and communications with clients sound more professional, as many of the employees in our company are fresh college graduates that do not have much experience with direct client communication. I do not do this, but I am aware of many that do. I have noticed that within my field (construction and construction regulation) AI seems to be becoming more and more prevalent for writing a standardized message to numerous recipients, like a standardized email from a regulatory inspector following inspection to all those involved in the site they inspected.

AI: That's fascinating - so you're seeing AI adoption in two different contexts: internal professional communication coaching for newer employees, and external standardized communications from regulators. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm not sure I've had such a situation. I view my use of AI as more like a hyper specific search engine search, giving me better results than if I were to just look something up on said search engine.

AI: That's a really practical way to think about it - as a specialized search tool rather than something that creates strong emotional reactions. It sounds like you've found a very functional niche for AI that works reliably for you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, given your specialized regulatory knowledge?

User: No. I think in the regulatory compliance field, there is not many things AI could take over. Consultation and interpretation regarding regulatory compliance onsite will have to remain a human task until we can get some form of mobile AI that can walk through a construction site by itself and identify any task items. AI could help streamline my more administrative tasks like SWPPP writing etc, but again, this would just make my job easier or quicker, but a human hand would still be required in these things to ensure compliance is correctly interpreted in every situation. '

AI: That perspective makes a lot of sense - your work requires physical site assessment and nuanced interpretation that AI can't replicate, at least not yet.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll stick with the current research-focused approach?

User: I do not see myself expanding my use of AI at this point. I think the most I will get out of it in my career is simply the streamlining of tasks I already do without it, as I mentioned before.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've carved out a very specific, practical use case for AI as a specialized research tool while maintaining clear boundaries about where human expertise remains essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a targeted research tool in regulatory compliance work, and how you've developed that verification system with your physical documents, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the practical applications and the clear limitations you see in your field. Have a great rest of your day!
