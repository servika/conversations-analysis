Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to create first drafts of action plans, to create questions for surveys, to take data from surveys and create drafts of executive level summaries and PowerPoint presentations. I sometimes use it to create activities for calls and team builder activities that can be used with remote teams. I have used it to problem solve for store specific challenges.

AI: That's a really diverse range of uses. When you mention using it for store specific challenges, can you tell me more about what that looks like? How do you typically approach problem solving with AI for those situations?

User: An example would be if we are having issues with customer satisfaction scores on a specific store, I will load data from our survey company and ask the program to determine if there are any overarching themes that it can identify, other possible issues that may be causing the low customer scores, and recommended training and actions that I can do with the team to improve the customer's experience which should positively impact the NPS scores and result in repeat business.

AI: That's a really concrete example - using AI to analyze survey data and generate actionable recommendations. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle bullet point business analysis to my vice president when she asks me for quick turnaround on feedback. I will use AI on projects where I have more time to double and triple check all the numbers and refine the document by using additional prompts and editing, but when she asks for a quick turnaround (less than six hours), I will personally handle the project from start to finish without AI assistance.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like time pressure actually makes you less likely to use AI, not more. Can you help me understand what's driving that decision? What about those quick turnaround situations makes you feel more confident handling them personally?

User: When using AI to do bigger assignments, there are usually corrections that need to be made with the data which has to do with the how the data was formatted to begin with. For example, on one analysis, there were associates who did not answer a question where I asked them to rate their confidence level on a scale of 1-5. The AI model I was using scored those as 0s when averaging the data. I had to go back and manually correct those. In future prompts and surveys, I will not let that be an option. I am continually learning on how to better incorporate AI in my daily work and will begin experimenting with these quick turnaround requests to see how it lines up with my answers without AI. I am also sometimes in stores without my laptop when these requests come in and I have limited experience using AI on my iPhone.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're being strategic about when the time investment in checking and correcting is worth it. It sounds like you're still in a learning phase with AI.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am definitely in the learning phase with AI and excited to see everything it can do to automate tasks and allow me focus on higher leverage activities. As of now, I am more likely to collaborate with AI than completely delegate. I will give it multiple prompts as I work on a project to continually refine the output until I get the final desired product and I still end up doing some final edits manually.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really hands-on. When you're going through those multiple prompts to refine the output, what typically drives you to give it another prompt versus switching to manual editing? What are you looking for that tells you it needs another round with AI?

User: I will usually use AI if I feel multiple parts of the document need to be adjusted. Sometimes it is tone. Sometimes I ask it to make another run to cut content for clarity.  The last manual touch ups are more of a personal choice and usually limited to a couple of sentences that I feel could flow better because of word selection or order. I also use AI to create recognition emails for top performers that have confetti coming down on the screen when opened by the associate. If I mess up the prompts and the actual output begins to move away from what I want it to look like instead of towards, I may stop where I am and make the necessary adjustments to get the desired result.

AI: The recognition emails with confetti sound really thoughtful! It's interesting that you have this sense of when the AI is moving "away from" versus "towards" what you want - that sounds like you've developed some intuition about when to course-correct.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: As of now, I am ahead of my colleagues and manager with AI integration in my role as a regional manager (store operations). I have been helping them learn how to use it. Our company is in the process of a digital first transformation, so AI is being integrated into search functions in our company communications and in scheduling our associates to ensure our top performers are working peak hours.

AI: So you're actually in a position where you're helping to lead AI adoption rather than following others. That's really interesting. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I decided to run a culture survey for my market to see how my team was doing and what we could do to improve the teamwork and overall satisfaction of our associates. I used Microsoft Forms to collect the data and then was able to use AI to collect the data, create an executive level summary of the findings, and then give recommended next steps to address the areas that were opportunities in the market. I was able to do this in a short period of time with a high quality output thanks to AI which I shared with my team and my VP. I followed the action points and it improved the morale of the Team and significantly improve our sales results and KPIs (retail jewelry stores). This was something that was not required by the company but something I felt was necessary. I would not have had the time to do this at this level without AI as regional managers in our company are expected to spend the majority of our time in stores and not in the office.

AI: That sounds like a really impactful project - using AI to enable something you wouldn't have had bandwidth for otherwise, and seeing it actually improve both morale and sales results. That's a perfect example of what you mentioned earlier about focusing on higher leverage activities.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am not worried about AI taking over my business as jewelry is a personal business that relies heavily on relationships. AI has and will continue to help better serve our customers by making sure we are staffed appropriately when our customers want to shop, that we are providing the product that they want, and the messaging that they want at the appropriate time. I will continue to sharpen my skills with AI to handle tasks and assist in analyzing store and sales data so I can better serve my associates and customers.

AI: That's a really confident perspective - seeing AI as a tool that enhances your ability to serve people rather than something that threatens your role. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will get better at giving prompts and I will learn how to delegate complete tasks for it to handle.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're strategically choosing when to use AI based on time constraints and your confidence in checking the output, and how you're seeing it enable higher-leverage work like that culture survey that directly improved your team's performance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being an early adopter in your organization, the collaborative approach you take with AI, and how you're thinking strategically about when and how to use these tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
