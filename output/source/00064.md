Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I am ready to begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I wrote a research paper back in April on how different levels of dehydration affect the heart and lungs' ability to input and output O2 and CO2. The idea was given to me by a professor. I planned the experimental design for one week, collected data in the lab over two weeks, and then wrote the paper over a period of two weeks. The whole process took just over five weeks.

AI: That's a fascinating project - the connection between dehydration and cardiopulmonary gas exchange sounds really important. It sounds like you had a well-structured timeline from planning through to completion.

Where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: The only time I ever used AI tools was for the revision of my paper. I did the planning, experiments, and wrote the paper without using AI. Once my paper was written- the introductions, methods, design, etc- I used AI to clean up the writing and fine-tune my vocabulary.

AI: That's really interesting that you saved AI for the very end of the process, specifically for the writing refinement. 

Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for that revision stage versus your traditional approach to editing and polishing your writing.

User: I have never been to strong in academic writing; I have always excelled in Science rather than English. Though I am a decent writer because I've had lots of practice, I often fail to find the best words to use and write smooth-flowing sentences. I give AI my paper and ask what grammar edits they would make to strengthen my paper.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to complement an area where you feel less confident while relying on your scientific expertise for the core work. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the experimental design, data collection, and initial writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those earlier stages?

User: The experimental design is easy for me to do on my own, and typically doesn't challenge me. I know what equipment I have in my lab, and figuring out how to use the machines and what procedures to do wouldn't help using AI; I am already educated on these things. The data collection also wouldn't benefit from using AI, since I am in a lab with the participant and manually fill in their data. I could use the AI to start the writing of my paper, but I like to get all of my personal ideas down and written before I confide in anybody else.

AI: I appreciate that insight about wanting to get your personal ideas down first - that's a really thoughtful approach to maintaining the integrity of your own thinking process.

When you do use AI for those grammar and writing edits, how do you verify or validate the changes it suggests before incorporating them into your final paper?

User: I typically can acknowledge that I was wrong just from knowing English my whole life- most of the suggestions they give are things I didn't catch while proofreading. If I don't know if the suggestion is good, which is mainly structural edits, I will just keep what I originally have.

AI: That's a practical approach - trusting AI where you can recognize the improvement and sticking with your original when you're uncertain about structural changes.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I honestly think I use AI for all of the things I want to, I dont really wish I could use it for anything else since I said above, the other aspects of my research need to be dont personally (making the experimental design, collecting data).

AI: That's really valuable to hear - it sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI complements your work without interfering with the parts that require your personal expertise and direct involvement.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on using AI strategically for writing refinement while maintaining personal ownership of the scientific process was particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Not that I can think of!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI for writing support while maintaining personal ownership of the scientific thinking and experimental work really help us understand how AI can fit naturally into research workflows without disrupting the core scientific process.

It's particularly interesting how you've identified a clear boundary - using AI where it enhances your existing capabilities in writing, but keeping the experimental design and data collection as your own domain where your expertise and direct involvement are essential.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
