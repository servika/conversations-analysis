Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope. I'm curious about this too. Go ahead and ask away.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to ask all sorts of things. I am a generally curious person, and I have my own petsitting business. I use AI daily for both work and other questions. As far as my work goes, I am a petsitter. While I am on the jobs I often use AI to ask questions about pet behaviors, training, health, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI as a real-time resource while you're actually caring for pets. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like? When you're on a petsitting job and something comes up with an animal's behavior or health, how do you typically interact with AI to get the help you need?

User: I will give you a recent example. My clients just got a puppy, and I was having a hard time with his activity level. I had a conversation with AI to see if his behavior was "normal" - he wanted constant attention when he was awake, and was just looking around for trouble. I wanted to know if he was bored, why was he doing this, etc.

AI: That sounds like a really practical use case. When you had that conversation about the puppy's behavior, what was the outcome? Did the AI help you understand what was happening, and were you able to apply any of the guidance while you were there with the puppy?

User: The AI did help me understand. The behavior is indeed normal, and we also talked about the fact that my clients decided not to do crate training, which I believed played a role in this puppy's troublemaking behavior and constant need for attention. We discussed how that could have contributed and my feelings about not crate training, etc.

AI: It sounds like the AI helped you both understand the puppy's behavior and process your own thoughts about the situation. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of pet care that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Hmm. I'm not sure if this question really applies to me. I mean almost all aspects of petsitting need to be handled myself, and in reality, this is a business that will not really be using AI as a major part of it. For me, it is just someone (something?) to bounce ideas off, ask questions, etc. I don't have to have it, I just personally find it helpful. But I really don't think there are many tasks AI could help with, at least until they get a robo-dog walker. A side note one of my clients does have a robo- automatic litter box.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - that AI serves more as a thinking partner rather than taking over actual tasks in your work. 

When you do use AI to bounce ideas off of or ask questions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Do you tend to have ongoing conversations with it about situations as they develop, or do you usually ask specific questions and then handle things on your own?

User: I tend to have ongoing conversations as ideas develop. I would say I do this pretty frequently. Petsitting can be a rather solitary business, and I don't always have a human around that knows things about animal behavior, what are most likely causes of things, etc. So again, this really is my own personal preference to use AI to just ask questions. I also use it for personal things that come up since I am my own boss and I am free to do what I wish when I am caring for the animals.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that conversational partner available when you're working alone. It sounds like AI fills a gap for you in terms of having someone knowledgeable to talk through situations with.

How have your colleagues or clients influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other petsitters you know use it similarly, or have your clients had any reactions to you using AI as a resource?

User: No, my colleagues or clients do not influence the way I use AI in my work. I don't know if any other petsitters use it - I have never asked. And I don't think my clients have any reactions - I don't really tell them about my conversations. Sometimes I use it to discuss my dissatisfaction with how my clients are doing certain things. For example, one of my clients does not believe in telling her dog "No" and only believes in positive reinforcement. So sometimes it is hard to deal with animal behaviors caused by my clients doing things which I would not do raising my own dog. I hope my answers are helpful.

AI: Your answers are very helpful - thank you for being so candid about those challenging situations with clients.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently had a convo with chatbot about the fact that one of my client's dogs is getting quite fat. I love him (the dog, [REDACTED]) and I know that it is not good for his health. My rule as a petsitter is let clients do what they want as long as it is not harmful to the pet. Then I say something. And I believe overweight dog isn't good. So I had a convo about how to discuss with my clients without hurting their feelings or offending them.

AI: That sounds like a really delicate situation - caring about [REDACTED]'s health while navigating the client relationship. 

What was it about that conversation with AI that made it particularly satisfying or frustrating for you? How did it help you think through that challenging balance?

User: I got insights as to how to bring up the situation with my client, ideas on what to say and how to say it, etc. So that was very helpful and satisfying. And I used suggestions, and it worked. [REDACTED] is now getting less food and treats. Turns out, my client agreed with me . . .

AI: That's wonderful that it worked out well for [REDACTED]! It sounds like AI helped you find the right approach to have a difficult but important conversation.

How do you think about maintaining your own expertise and instincts about animal behavior in areas where AI is giving you guidance? Is this something you actively consider as you use it more?

User: I don't actively consider it, no. But I am learning more about animal behavior than I would have if I did not have AI.

AI: That's an interesting point - that using AI is actually expanding your knowledge rather than replacing it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think it will change as your business grows or as the technology develops?

User: I don't think it will change too much. I don't really see how this could evolve much past the point I am now because of what I use it for. Also, I am done growing my business and looking to retire in the next few years.

AI: That makes sense given where you are in your career and business trajectory.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a conversational partner in what can be a solitary profession, and how it helped you navigate that delicate situation with [REDACTED]'s weight.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a thinking partner and resource while working independently have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you and [REDACTED] continue doing well!
