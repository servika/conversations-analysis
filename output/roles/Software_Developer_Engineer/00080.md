Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: a recent project that i worked on was to identify the differences between bootstrap and jackknife variance estimation. I created a setup using different estimation models such as linear regression estimation and ratio estimation, and used simulated data to calculate the variance in order to test efficiency.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting statistical comparison study. Tell me more about that process - how did you go from that initial idea of comparing bootstrap and jackknife methods to actually setting up your simulation and getting your results?

User: It was part of my undergraduate course in survey sampling. I needed to compare bootstrap and jackknife efficiency. The method that I chose was part of an earlier statistics course, and I just wanted to see how the two methods would perform with regards to computational efficiency and theoretical variance.

AI: I see, so this was building on methods you'd learned previously. When you were setting up those simulations and working through the different estimation models - the linear regression and ratio estimation - where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: Coming up with R code to create simulated studies was a big thing. I already had sample code, but I needed to fit it with the specific ratio estimation and linear regression models. So to tweak the sample code, I used AI, mostly to focus more on the report writing over the coding.

AI: That makes sense - using AI to handle the code modifications so you could focus on the analysis and writing. Tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for tweaking that R code.

User: Well I already knew how the math worked behind it, and I had some familiarity with R already. But I didn't really want to rewrite the entire code block over and over again, so i figured it would be more efficient to use AI

AI: So it sounds like efficiency was a key factor - you had the conceptual understanding but wanted to avoid the repetitive coding work. When you used AI for those code modifications, how did you verify or validate what it produced to make sure it was implementing your bootstrap and jackknife methods correctly?

User: The outputs had to make sense obviously. I had a general idea for what I was expecting for the variance estimation for both methods. Since I had a good understanding of R programming, it was pretty straightforward for me to read through the code for any glaring issues. From what I remember, there were a couple of variables that I needed to rename and some loops that I needed to fix for my own purposes. So basically, I used AI to get a 80% complete framework, and I made my edits where I deemed it necessary.

AI: That's a really practical approach - getting that 80% framework and then applying your expertise to refine it. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - maybe the theoretical analysis, the report writing you mentioned, or interpreting your simulation results - what's kept you from trying AI there, or have you experimented with it in those areas too?

User: I really wanted to understand the mathematics behind what I was doing. With the report writing, coding was the easiest part of it. The mathematics was more challenging in that I had to refer to graduate level textbooks to understand what was going on. I also have ethical concerns when it comes to intellectual property, so I didn't want to use AI to write or rewrite something that is already present in a textbook or my professor's lecture notes.

AI: That's really thoughtful - both wanting to truly understand the mathematics yourself and being mindful about intellectual property. Those ethical concerns are interesting. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I'm not sure if there is anything that I actually need out of AI. For me, AI is a convenience tool, I don't really need it to do anything for me. Whatever quality of life improvements it may bring is something I may or may not incorporate, but I'm not going out of my way to look for these improvements. I find that I am pretty self-sufficient in that regard.

AI: That's a really clear perspective on AI as a convenience rather than a necessity. You seem quite intentional about when and how you use it - using it for that R code efficiency but drawing clear boundaries around the mathematical understanding and ethical considerations.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on AI as a quality-of-life tool rather than something essential, and your thoughtful approach to the intellectual property concerns, were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No I don't think so.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for efficiency while maintaining your own deep understanding of the mathematics really help us understand the nuanced way researchers think about integrating these tools into their work. The balance you've struck between leveraging AI as a convenience tool while preserving intellectual integrity is exactly the kind of authentic perspective we're hoping to learn from.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
