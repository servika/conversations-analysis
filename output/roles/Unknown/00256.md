Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I don't have any questions off the bat.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I use it to help me prepare lessons and goals to be achieved by the kids I teach. Specifically, this is for music instruction at a camp where there is a huge range of abilities and a lot of different instruments available. Examples of tasks I'll use AI for are; researching and locating sheet music for songs at various difficulties, learning and simplifying music theory, finding skills of equivalent difficulty and relevance between instruments, and suggestions for short activities.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic teaching environment with all those different instruments and skill levels. 

When you're using AI to research sheet music or find equivalent skills across instruments, how does that process typically unfold? Do you come to the AI with very specific requirements, or is it more of a back-and-forth exploration?

User: I tend to go to the AI with very specific requirements, e.g. "I am looking for a piece of music that has only four chords, and can be played within one octave in the right hand on a piano, what are some pieces that would work for this brief?", or "how are harmonic and melodic minors different, and how do you work each of them out from the root note"

AI: That's really specific - it sounds like you know exactly what you need before you ask. 

Tell me more about how you developed that approach. Do you find yourself getting better results with those detailed prompts, or did you start out asking questions differently?

User: I think I have found that vaguer prompts tend to give results that aren't as useful to me. I try and limit how much I use the AI, and aim to use it only for tasks that would otherwise involve me researching for an extended period of time. By asking for exactly what I am looking for it tends to speed up results hugely.

AI: That's interesting that you actively try to limit your AI use. 

What makes you want to keep that usage contained? Are there particular aspects of your teaching preparation that you prefer to handle yourself?

User: I have read a few articles about the effects of AI on creativity, and the general consensus of these tends to be that the more you rely on something else to come up with original ideas for you, the harder it becomes for you to do when you next try. I don't want to lose my ability to think creatively, so where possible I avoid using the AI for these tasks, and as a result I tend to just limit my AI use in general.

AI: That concern about creativity makes a lot of sense given your role as a music educator. 

Can you walk me through how you decide in the moment whether a task is something you should handle yourself versus something that's appropriate for AI? What's going through your mind when you're making that distinction?

User: I always start by writing down what I need to get done, then I will just dive right in to seeing what I can do myself. I often will consider using the AI whenever a task would have to involve me doing any research (where I would be googling), and then I determine whether I would prefer to research regularly, or whether it would be overall beneficial to use an AI in that particular instance. Sometimes I will also start googling, and then find that there are too many results for what I am looking for, so will turn to an AI to help narrow the search down.

AI: So you're essentially using AI as a replacement for certain types of online searching, especially when you hit information overload.

When you do make the decision to use AI instead of continuing with Google, how do you typically feel about that choice? Does it feel like a practical decision, or do you have other reactions to switching over?

User: Yes absolutely. When I choose to switch to an AI, it usually feels like a practical choice, but sometimes I also feel somewhat guilty about switching over, as though I am taking the lazier option- however sometimes the results are so helpful that this guilt is assuaged, as I know that I would not have been able to achieve those same results in anywhere near the speed with which the AI did.

AI: That tension between feeling guilty and then being impressed by the results is really compelling. 

Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I remember that at one point I was trying to work out an order of difficulty for playing major scales on piano. I knew that I could list the scales by order of their accidentals, but I was a bit rusty as I hadn't practiced this in a while, so knew I would have to be double checking each one anyway. I asked the AI for a suggestion of this, and it responded quite helpfully- it listed the scales by order of increased accidentals, and then it also gave an order of increased difficulty as determined by when each scale appears in the ABRSM piano exams, and having the two lists just immediately provided, and therefore being able to compare them and determine my own order from the results was super helpful so I was very satisfied.

AI: That's a perfect example of how AI can augment your expertise rather than replace it - you still made the final decision about ordering, but had much richer information to work with.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: It was definitely a fairly frequent topic of conversation among my peers and I. There was certainly a range of opinions on it- my two superiors tended to default to using AI in any possible situation, whereas others would point blank refuse to use it, but it was always a welcomed discussion. I think I probably did end up using it more simply because of the frequency with which my superiors used it too.

AI: That's really interesting how the range of attitudes around you influenced your own usage - it sounds like seeing your superiors use it frequently made it feel more acceptable or normal for you to try it too.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Personally I am very keen to maintain skills in all areas, even if it's something that an AI could potentially take over. This is something I actively consider, and I am keen to keep up my knowledge just for the security of knowing that I achieved something, and I can explain how I achieved any result I get.

AI: That desire to be able to explain how you achieved results really stands out.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use it, or are you pretty settled in your current approach?

User: I think I am quite settled in my current approach, but I suppose I am always open to improving and developing my workflow.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on balancing efficiency with maintaining your creative and analytical skills - that tension between practical benefits and preserving your own capabilities seems to be something you've really thought through carefully.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's everything covered!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research tool while being mindful of preserving creativity and expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
