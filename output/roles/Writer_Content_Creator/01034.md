Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So, I'm a copywriter. The main way in which I use AI in my job is when my clients ask me to create content for them using AI - so, instead of me writing a piece of text from scratch, they'll ask me to prompt an AI model to write it and then edit it to sound more human-like. Some of the content I use AI for includes articles, blog posts, and social media captions.

AI: That's fascinating - so you're essentially acting as an AI editor and translator, making AI-generated content sound more human. 

When you're working on these projects, what does your editing process typically look like? Are you making small tweaks or doing more substantial rewrites?

User: For some things it's only small tweaks - social media captions, for example. I don't really enjoy writing them myself and feel like I can never do it well so often I will only make tiny edits to AI-generated captions, or just use what I get 'as is'. However, for longer pieces of content I will sometimes edit it substantially to make the tone sound better or more 'on brand' for my client, or to add regional slang and references. I am Australian and my clients are too, and AI doesn't always generate content that sounds local. Sometimes I'll also edit and rewrite articles to incorporate things my clients request such as case studies they've conducted as a business.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like the length and type of content really influences how much of your own voice you bring to it. The cultural localization aspect is particularly interesting.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you don't enjoy writing social media captions yourself - are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them?

User: I mean, I really like writing so I often prefer to do that myself. Sometimes I find it easier and quicker to write a short article than to have an AI model write it for me...once I get past prompting and explaining what I want it can sometimes be better for me to just do it myself! Some of my clients in the health and wellness industry for example want me to reference medical journals or scientific papers when I write - AI can't always do that well, so in that case I find it more efficient for me to write the content from scratch and reference what I want, rather than editing a AI content to add the references.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like when you need specific, accurate references or when the prompting becomes too complex, your expertise actually makes you faster than going through AI.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It's a mixture of both, I think. Sometimes I will just delegate to AI and then take the content it produces and work on it myself, but other times I will ask the model to refine and rewrite things for me. As I've become more comfortable working with AI and more aware of what it does I definitely ask it to collaborate more.

AI: That evolution from delegation to more collaboration is really interesting. You mentioned becoming more aware of what AI does - what kinds of things have you learned about working with it?

User: I think the main thing I've learned is how responsive it can be to good prompts. When I first started using AI I would just prompt it with things like, "Write me a magazine-style article about..." but I now know that it can handle much more complex prompts, and that these complex prompts often give me higher-quality responses.

AI: That's a great observation about the evolution of your prompting skills. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they have particular attitudes or approaches that have shaped how you think about it?

User: To be honest, some of my clients don't know a lot about AI and think it's just a magical problem-solving machine that I can use to save time and money. They don't really understand that writing prompts and editing content takes time and expertise as well. I've actually had one or two clients say that they wanted to stop using my services and just use AI, and then they've later come back to me and said they need help again because they're not familiar with prompting. Similarly I have had some clients ask me to use AI thinking it will save them money...but it doesn't always work like that! Haha.

AI: That's really revealing - it sounds like there's a real gap between client expectations and the reality of what AI can deliver without human expertise. The fact that some clients tried to go it alone and came back speaks volumes!

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, one situation in which I felt really satisfied was when I asked an AI model to generate some short social media captions for me. I spent some time on the prompt and outlined everything it needed to include, like hashtags and emojis and references to products, and it did really well. As I said earlier I don't really like writing social media captions, so I was very thankful for AI in that moment! Haha. A moment in which I felt frustrated though was when I was trying to find some studies on a particular medical condition that one of my clients had asked me to write about. Ordinarily I would use Google Scholar to find relevant studies and articles but I tried AI, and it didn't really find me anything useful. It just spoke in quite general terms as though I was asking for advice personally, not researching the condition. Maybe my prompt wasn't up to scratch, but it was a little frustrating.

AI: Those examples really highlight the difference between AI's strengths and limitations - it sounds like it excels at creative formatting tasks but struggles with research requiring specific, credible sources.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is, big time. Blog and article writing used to be my bread and butter but now it feels like a lot of people are using AI for that. I've considered shifting into grant writing, which is a more specific and responsive area of writing that I don't think AI will become big in, at least for a while. In the past I've been curious about academic editing as well.

AI: That's a really strategic approach - moving toward more specialized areas where human expertise and nuance are harder to replace. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that for as long as I'm a copywriter I'll always be using AI somehow. I genuinely enjoy writing so I don't want to ever stop writing and just outsource it all to a model, but I can see situations in which it will be useful - if I'm doing something I don't feel I excel at (like the social media captions!) or writing for a client who has a really specific brand voice. I could craft a great prompt and let AI do most of the work for me! However, I do worry that copywriters will be less in-demand because of AI as well. I guess I'm also interested in learning more about how I can use AI for productivity, as well - like if AI can help me manage my schedule or respond to messages and emails. That would be a big help at work!

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how client expectations don't always match the reality of AI's capabilities, and your strategic thinking about evolving your skills toward areas where human expertise remains essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Hmm, I don't think so. I think one of the issues that remains largest in my mind is - as you said - how client expectations of AI don't always match up to its real-world capabilities. It's interesting being a 'mediator' between my clients and AI, sometimes telling them that it can't do something they think it should, and sometimes telling them that it's far more advanced than they think it is! I think as AI becomes more widely used, people will learn more about it and hopefully understand more about what its capable of.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - you really are in this unique position as a translator between the technology and clients' expectations. The idea of being a "mediator" between clients and AI captures something really important about how these tools are actually being integrated into work, rather than just replacing it entirely.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolving role of human expertise, the reality of AI collaboration, and those client dynamics will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you! :)

AI: You're very welcome! It was really enlightening to hear about your experiences. Take care, and thanks again for participating in our research!
