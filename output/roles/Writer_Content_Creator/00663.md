Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Thank you - let's proceed.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a content writer. Although I engage mainly with language engines, funnily enough I DON'T use them for writing tasks - more like everything else. Research, data summary, idea gen, polishing copy, or curveball uses (getting AI to challenge me and think of new perspectives). These are on an as-and-when basis and there is no requirement for me to use AI, but I am typically using it a few times a week.

AI: That's really interesting that you avoid using AI for the actual writing but lean on it for all those supporting tasks. 

Tell me more about what makes writing different for you - what is it about that core writing work that you prefer to keep to yourself?

User: I work in relatively technical areas that require research and understanding - we have clients in life sciences, IT, automotive etc. and the content I write is for a B2B audience, so it can get quite in-depth.
Since public LLMs aren't trained specifically for this purpose, they can produce copy that is more generic than needed - and with technical subjects, the risk of hallucinations or inaccurate statements is greater. I think AI would do a great job with more generic or universal writing tasks with a large audience, but less so here.
Besides, the writing is in some ways the easy part of the job... I could write a 500-word press release in 15 minutes if I already had a strong understanding of the topic at hand. It's getting that understanding that is the hard part, and can take many hours (or days, or weeks) of work. So this is where applying AI can be a greater time-saver.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially using AI to tackle the time-intensive foundation work while keeping the specialized expertise piece for yourself.

When you're using AI for that research and understanding phase, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout that process, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: It's collaborative. I expect to have a conversation with many rounds. Typically I would ask a basic high-level question first ("state of the fungicide market 2025") and then dive deeper into any particular insights, market challenges, areas I don't understand etc. That seems a light-touch way of tailoring the output to what I need.
I'm not sure how I would go about giving the AI a complete workflow for research. I guess it would be an enormous report or whitepaper?

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds really dynamic - almost like having a research partner you can probe deeper with.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others approach it similarly, or have you noticed different patterns?

User: I do take inspiration from colleagues, who use it for content and idea generation. The Strategy team in particular seem into it for understanding client briefs, getting to know new clients we are pitching for, summarizing what they do and how they provide value.
Plus, our Creative team use AI image editors for creation, retouching and extending images. They have managed to weave together multimodal workflows where they describe something in ChatGPT, have it prompt Midjourney for them, and then refine the results. It's really impressive but it's a visual medium - I don't know if this would translate to written work.

AI: That's fascinating how different teams have found their own niches with AI - from strategy work to those sophisticated visual workflows.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Good experience: asking for brainstorming support on a couple of occasions. One for blogs and other content we could write for our own agency, another for a client who wanted help producing internal content for their brand community. On both occasions the AI went the 'extra mile' and generated multimedia ideas that could extend the initial premise.
Poor experience: once asked for help producing a video voiceover script and AI just didn't want to use the format I specified (which was just 400 words of flowing text). It kept wanting to format it like a movie script with stage directions.

AI: That formatting issue sounds really frustrating - especially when you have a specific deliverable format you need to hit.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do research into AI, how it is trained and improved. So I hope to be able to move into more AI-focused roles if content-focused roles decline.
I also think that the more generic your role is, the more at risk it is. So specialising in technical subjects will hopefully insulate me for a while. 
There is a general trend that marketing agencies are having a difficult time. AI will be part of that, but so will the general economy and how companies act. I am trying to diversify while keeping a strong niche, if that makes sense. But I would also be interested to hear what you think the future holds and how I can safeguard my income.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - staying specialized while also building knowledge about AI itself. I can hear that you're thinking strategically about positioning yourself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the tools improve?

User: I would hope that AI models improve their output and become more reliable - so I don't have to worry about hallucinations in everything it generates. In that future, I would become more confident using it end-to-end in content workflows, or even experimenting with more ambitious and automated workflows (probably outside of my day job, unless it was working *really* well).
So I could see my use evolving, but I will always be cautious. AI companies always tell us how amazing their newest model is, but I want to see evidence of it, not just take their claims at face value.

AI: That cautious, evidence-based approach really comes through in everything you've shared.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've carved out this collaborative research role for AI while maintaining the specialized writing expertise yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Trust and authenticity may be the key to the future. While some people love AI-assisted content, others see it as inherently 'worse' than human-created content. AI providers must work on this issue and convincingly make the case that AI is here to enable and enrich, not replace and undermine.

AI: That's a really valuable point about the perception and trust challenges that go beyond just technical capabilities.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that balance between leveraging AI's research capabilities while maintaining human expertise in specialized domains will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about both the opportunities and the challenges ahead.
