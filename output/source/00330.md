**Transcript ID:** AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you're trying to meet so many specific constraints at once and the AI keeps circling back to suggestions you've already ruled out. When you say the model would ""forget previous instructions

---

" what did that look like? Did it start suggesting things from earlier in the conversation that you'd already said wouldn't work?

User: At a point long into the conversation, I would ask it to try again, in addition to whatever new constraint or RESTATED constraint (just me reminding the model). It would output a new recipe following this new/same instruction, BUT include brown butter or it would be a stewed vegetable (both items that I had ruled out). It would try to follow what I had recently stated and not very earlier previously stated. This would be despite me saying "in addition to all prior constraints."

AI: That must have been really maddening - having to constantly remind it of things you'd already established. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they use it too, or are you pretty much on your own with it?

User: Not really, most of the individuals I work with are unfamiliar with AI (older crowd). Also, for many positions, the work is hands-on and repetitive, which doesn't require AI or technological assistance.

AI: So you're pretty much pioneering this on your own. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really, as a cook I'm not worried about AI taking over these tasks. I'd love if we had the option for AI to take over all customer assistance, but it's not likely.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - you see AI as potentially helpful for customer service but not a threat to your cooking skills. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll use it more, differently, or about the same?

User: I might start evolving to ask about new cooking techniques for the equipment I have, a sort of evolution to asking for new recipes. Maybe slightly more often.

AI: That makes sense - expanding from recipes to techniques seems like a natural next step. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed clear boundaries around what tasks are worth AI's help versus where it creates more friction than value.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI's strengths and limitations in a specialized field like yours - especially dealing with complex constraints and the challenge of maintaining context in longer conversations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your experiences today!
