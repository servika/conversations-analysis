Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my ad copywriting work I typically use AI to help me refine copy I've already written, to collaborate on creative ideas and to research topics, businesses or words. Usually I'll request things like creative tagline options or hooks similar to ones I have in mind, so I can have more options and create the best copy possible without spending a ton of time on projects.

AI: That's really helpful to understand your workflow. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Usually I like to write complete drafts myself and then ask AI for feedback or ways to improve. Or I'll ask for help on one part of an ad or other ways to phrase certain sentences I've already written. Even though AI can write an entire ad, I don't like to ask for full drafts because that's what I'm being paid to do and it feels unethical.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate throughout the task. Basically if I feel stuck at any point, I'll ask the AI for help, but usually I'll request help when I'm finished with the task and think there are things that could be improved, like having a better hook or better flowing sentences or if a word feels off. If I'm writing an ad for an industry I'm unfamiliar with I might ask for research assistance or ideas before I start writing, but usually I request assistance after my first draft.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace culture is super competitive, encourages very fast turnarounds and rewards quantity, which definitely influences my use of AI since it helps me complete projects much faster while maintaining a competitive high quality of work.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time I felt satisfied was when I needed to complete multiple projects on a tight time crunch that didn't leave much time to creatively brainstorm. AI helped me come up with creative hooks that made the process of writing much easier, making me feel less stress about the little time I had.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I sometimes feel like AI has already taken over in areas of my job and it feels pointless to maintain these skills and like I should just invest in learning new skills. For example, coming up with names for products is a job I used to get a lot, but never get anymore since this is something AI excels in. I think it's more worth investing in skills that AI isn't that good at, like handling complex instructions and coming up with unique ideas.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see my relationship with AI becoming more of a collaboration to make work go faster. Sometimes I feel like I'm becoming the AI's assistant and editor instead of the AI being the assistant.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the competitive workplace culture shapes your AI use and your honest reflection about feeling like you're becoming the AI's editor rather than the other way around.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
