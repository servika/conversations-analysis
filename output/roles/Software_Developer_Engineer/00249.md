Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: The daily tasks I use AI to assist with ranges from creating email responses and general announcements to creating graphs and organizing data. Working within the admissions office of a technical college, I typically have to create reports and scripts with specific information that requires a lot of detail. I find myself using AI to create these reports for me and even summarizing the data. It has been significant in saving myself time as majority of the time I just have to verify the information is correct and making minor tweaks if needed. Recently, I have taken on the task of learning the F1 Student Visa process for international students and AI has assisted me in creating training material which has significantly helped as I put in the information I want and the AI has formatted it per my specific requests.

AI: That sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your work at the admissions office. You mentioned using it for everything from emails to detailed reports and training materials.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are not any specific tasks that I would not use AI for however some of the information we have is private therefore I cannot use AI to assist with it. I am able to use if for general information like the percentage of students who are coded out-of-state or extracting specific information for sets of data.

AI: That's a really important distinction about private information. It sounds like privacy constraints are the main factor that determines when you can't use AI, rather than personal preference.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It is more so 50/50. Like I mentioned previously, I have used it to create specific graphs or pull specific data by delegating it to create while providing the data and specific requirements. I have also collaborated with it while creating training material by requesting information on what format training material is best understood and how to create it.

AI: That's interesting that it's a fairly even split between delegating complete tasks and collaborating. It sounds like the approach depends on what you're trying to accomplish.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Since we work at a college, we have had to learn about AI from the beginning since many students use it. Our college has created training sessions for employees to learn and understand how AI works and even how it can benefit us in the work place. Within the past few months we have also added an AI system to our website for people to use when visiting the page. It works great for those looking for information on the website or needing answers to general questions.

AI: It sounds like your college has been quite proactive in embracing AI both for employees and students. That kind of institutional support seems really valuable.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Majority of the time I am very pleased with the outcome from using AI and I cannot recall a time where I was frustrated with it. While there have been a few times when the information provided was not accurate, it tends to be on point. I am vey satisfied with how well it extracts data from various datasets and can create very specific graphs based on the information I provide it. I also enjoy how well it summarizes the information when I ask it to.

AI: It's great to hear that your experience has been overwhelmingly positive. You mentioned a few times where the information wasn't accurate - when that happens, how do you typically catch those errors?

User: It is usually minor errors with miscalculations or sometimes the AI does not understand my request so I have to rephrase it. Since I deal with sensitive data, I do have to verify the information is accurate or it can ultimately invalidate future data.

AI: That verification step sounds crucial, especially given the sensitivity of your data. You mentioned that you're working with F1 visa processes and student information where accuracy is really important.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I believe that many of the tasks I complete can be automated by AI and ultimately take over my position or at least majority of my job, this is something I consider often. Due to the confidentiality aspect of my position as well as the customer service portion, I do not foresee it completely taking over those. Since I also help international students come here to study, I maintain my skills by staying up-to-date on the changes in regulations and laws.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - recognizing both the potential for automation while also identifying the human-centered aspects that remain essential. The regulatory changes and customer service elements you mentioned do seem like areas where human judgment and relationship-building matter.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe that with the advances in AI, my relationship with it will continue to evolve as it assists with daily tasks and providing accurate information. I believe it will continue to cut down on the unnecessary time it takes to run datasets and summarize information, ultimately increasing productivity at work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how privacy constraints naturally shape where you can use AI, and your balanced view of both the productivity benefits and the potential career implications.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working in higher education admissions, balancing productivity gains with privacy requirements, and thinking through the evolving role of AI in your field will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
