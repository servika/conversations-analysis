Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great! I do not currently have questions, but may have some later.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a freelance writer and novelist and also make videos for TikTok and YouTube. Typical projects are my longer novels at 50k-100k words, though I also have done guided meditation scripts quite a bit.

AI: That's a fascinating mix of creative work - from long-form novels to short-form social media content and meditation scripts. That sounds like it requires quite a range of different creative approaches.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I usually start off my process by talking to an LLM and instructing it to guide me through the process, including schedules, checklists, and required research for that project. Example prompts include:
"I'm writing a high fantasy novel set in a temperate jungle climate. Give me a list of countries and cultures to research, create a short description of how this may differ from a typical eurocentric based fantasy, and walk me through a detailed process of drafting including Character Arcs, 3 levels of outlining the project as a whole, and how to pace scenes and chapters."
"I am working on a reality shifting guided meditation for a Henry Danger based DR. Please give me 3 different examples for guided meditation practices, a list of 15 immersive affirmations, a brief overview of the show including the general vibes, and a short 2nd person narration of waking up in Swellview and attending SVHS."

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI almost like a creative project manager or consultant at the start of your projects. You're essentially asking it to help you map out the entire scope and structure before you begin.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you worked through the creative process?

User: Recently I used AI to speed run a creative project by asking it to create a 7 day fast drafting guide. It had to hit all of the major writing concepts such as in-depth world building, full characters arcs, plot progression, narrative themes, and tips for foreshadowing. 
I immediately started outlining the draft in another document and would either ask questions, request it go in more depth for a specific day, or to continue with the next day.
I actually ended up outlining a 4 part novel series with 12 main characters over the course of 5 days, and am preparing to move onto the research phase. Though I will probably try a different LLM for the part because, while the model did well with the planning phase, it was not very helpful in recommending good resources for learning more about Thailand and Thai fairy tales. 
Overall I was happy with the first results and it was extremely helpful for someone with ADHD as well as other neurological disorders that make staying on track incredibly difficult. The model was also very encouraging.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly productive five days! Creating outlines for a 4-part series with 12 main characters is quite an accomplishment. It's particularly interesting that you found the AI helpful for managing the ADHD-related challenges with staying on track.

When you're working with AI in this way - having it guide you through the process and provide structure - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am very much driving the creative side. I personally would find use AI to generate the ideas and content rather boring. I am not usually a fan of the 'creative' output and will heavily edit, usually only keeping the structure and formatting in tact. 
In the past I used AI for a Jedi based meditation and had to entirely rewrite the lore aspects, with only the breathing counts and meditation prep remaining the same.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making - using AI as a structural scaffold while keeping the creative heart entirely your own. It sounds like you see the AI as providing the framework and organization, but the actual creative substance and voice comes from you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: I would say the most noticeable difference is just that I get a lot more done in a shorter amount of time. As a result of that I also have the time to add more specific and immersive details to my storytelling, so it has really helped with world building and atmosphere. For my YT creative content it has helped me just get videos done instead of spending all day writing a script I wouldn't even end up using.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds really significant - especially the part about actually completing video scripts instead of abandoning them. It sounds like AI has helped you move past some of those creative bottlenecks.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm not too concerned about AI in my field because AI was designed to mimic humans. People decrying AI as soulless imitation completely ignore that there are many uncreative humans out there with similarly uncreative works that just mashes together their favorite aspects of other works.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you're seeing AI as part of a broader spectrum of creativity rather than something fundamentally different. It sounds like you view originality and creativity as existing on a continuum that includes both humans and AI.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it will continue to help me polish and refine my writing so that my readers keep looking back and finding tidbits and Easter eggs they missed before. I have a lot of novel ideas that probably never would have been touched if I hadn't finished previous projects in the short amount of time that I did. 
Also I believe that AI will help me analyze my weaknesses as an author and work on them over the next few years.

AI: That's a really forward-thinking approach - using AI not just for project management but for self-improvement as a writer. The idea of AI helping you identify and work on your weaknesses is particularly interesting.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI serving as a structural scaffold while you maintain creative control, and how that's allowed you to tackle more ambitious projects like your 4-part novel series.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. It's been really valuable to hear how you've found such a productive balance between using AI as a structural tool while keeping the creative vision entirely your own.

I hope your research phase for the Thai fairy tale project goes well, and best of luck with that 4-part novel series!
