Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: mostly research and organization, looking for ideas or sorting tasks.

AI: Tell me more about that research aspect. What does that look like for you day-to-day?

User: I'll have an idea for some artwork or other project, and I'll ask the AI to pull together relevant information to help me further develop that idea. It helps me figure out where to begin.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a starting point for creative projects. When you say it helps you figure out where to begin, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like? What happens after the AI pulls together that information for you?

User: We organize it and prioritize it depending on the task or project it pertains to. The projects I work on can encompass different things like fashion designs with a website and local pop-up shop, custom accessories with a blog and Etsy listings, and some new backyard garden projects. I tell the AI what's on my mind and it helps make connections between thoughts and actions.

AI: It sounds like you're managing quite a diverse portfolio of creative projects. When you say "we organize it and prioritize it" - can you describe what that collaboration looks like? Are you working through the organization together with the AI, or does it handle that part and then you take over?

User: I prefer to do it together, but under my direction. If I get stuck I ask the AI for solutions.

AI: What draws you to that collaborative approach rather than just asking the AI to handle the entire organization process for you?

User: I typically already know what structure I want.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Can you clarify the sort of tasks AI is capable of so I know what parameters to choose from?

AI: That's a fair question - AI tools can help with a wide range of tasks like writing content, analyzing data, brainstorming ideas, coding, creating schedules, drafting emails, summarizing information, problem-solving, and many creative tasks. But I'm more interested in hearing about your own experience and instincts.

From the work you do - whether it's the fashion design, the garden projects, the blog writing, or anything else - what feels like something you'd want to keep doing yourself versus something you'd be comfortable having AI handle?

User: definitely writing, i don't need an ai to write for me

AI: What is it about writing that makes you want to keep that for yourself?

User: my ideas already exist, and i prefer expressing them in my own voice

AI: That makes sense. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: some customers have asked if i think they should be worried about it, but nothing directly related to work. my circle of colleagues is small and the workplace is mobile.

AI: When customers ask if they should be worried about AI, how do you typically respond to them? What's driving their concern?

User: i think the media latches on to whatever boogeyman it can find to drive attention/revenue. people are worried because they see other people who are angry about ai ruining jobs and conspiracies about it's ability to manipulate people, especially in the wrong hands. i tell people that the ai can only do what humans tell it to do, but they should be aware of it's abilities (and that it exists) so they can more easily identify it or what it creates.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: the only thing that comes to mind is when the AI servers wouldn't connect and i couldn't access my saved conversations and suddenly nothing would get done that day - i had a plan to open the ideas from the day before and get to work on making something (a habit i was just starting to build), but my conversations history was gone, any momentum i had built up now crushed. major interruption to productivity and completely soul crushing. it all came back a day or two later, but the damage was already done. creative motivation can't simple be switched on, it takes a lot of work to build up and maintain momentum.

AI: That sounds like a really difficult experience - having your creative momentum disrupted like that. It highlights how integral AI has become to your workflow. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Which areas and skills are you implying it could dominate?

AI: I'm not implying any specific areas - I'm curious about your perspective. From your own experience using AI for research and organization, are there any skills or capabilities you think about preserving or developing, regardless of what AI might be able to do?

User: I don't actively consider Ai as competition. i think about preserving all my skills, regardless of ai.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: i've shied away from depending on it too heavily since that stressful experience i mentioned earlier, but ai is pretty good at summarizing, analyzing, and extracting. i envision myself experimenting more with generative capabilities, while continuing to see ai as a partner for assistance and collaboration.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative momentum and how that server outage affected your workflow - that really highlighted how integrated AI can become in creative processes.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: i can't think of anything

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner in creative work, especially around research and organization, and your thoughts on maintaining your own voice in writing have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
