Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have any questions that sounds fine

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to automate processes, to help me draft complex emails and to understand clauses from agreements I am unfamiliar with

AI: That's really interesting - those sound like quite different types of tasks. When you say you use AI to automate processes, can you walk me through what that looks like? What's a specific example of a process you've automated?

User: So I have software integrated into my workflows -  a good example would be using AI to automatically compare different draft versions of documents to track changes between them, without the need for me to manually compare them

AI: That sounds like a real time-saver. So the AI is handling that comparison work in the background while you focus on other things. 

When it comes to those complex emails you mentioned drafting - tell me more about that. What makes those emails complex, and how do you typically work with AI on them?

User: the complexity varies, it might be that i need help with capturing a certain tone whilst also conveying important legal information. A good example is getting it to simplify legal definitions for non legal email recipients - I find it can help me be really concise

AI: That's a great example - translating legal concepts for different audiences. When you're working on those emails, how do you typically go about it? Do you write a draft first and then ask AI to help refine it, or do you start by explaining what you need to the AI and have it create something from scratch?

User: I'd typically give a bullet list of what i want it to do/ not do and also the legal language I need incorporated or explained

AI: So you're giving it the framework and constraints upfront. That makes sense for legal work where precision matters.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer composing more personal or tactical emails myself, I also prefer building my own to-do lists and drafting my own notes - the reason being I don't want to lose meaning and I want to maintain human connection, and i want to be involved in my own note taking so I truly understand what i am talking about

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - maintaining that human connection and ensuring you truly understand your own work. It sounds like there's something important to you about staying directly involved in certain types of thinking and communication.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: it depends a little on the task but typically I would be pretty involved throughout and give it quite a lot to work with

AI: So you're staying engaged rather than just handing things off. That's interesting given your legal background where accuracy is so critical.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: I think it's still quite scary in the legal community, I use it in a way where I have a lot of control over whats coming out so I can trust the output more

AI: That's fascinating - the legal community being cautious makes a lot of sense given the stakes involved. When you say you use it in a way where you have "a lot of control over what's coming out," can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? How do you maintain that control?

User: I think by giving a lot of factual basis in prompts and also a lot of restrictions as to what I don't want it to do helps to create a streamlined and more tailored response. I am wary of work turning out that looks to be AI generated.

AI: That makes complete sense - you're being very strategic about input to get reliable output, and you want the final work to authentically represent you and your firm.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It really saved me time/emotional stress in my last role when I was having some issues with a potential misconduct - it removed all emotion and gathered facts/asked a lot of helpful follow ups

AI: That sounds like AI was really valuable in helping you navigate a challenging situation objectively. It's interesting that you found the AI's neutral perspective and systematic approach particularly helpful during something so emotionally charged.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: yes I definetley consider that, for me I think it is more about learning to work with it and be happy where it can take over stressful or annoying tasks - I want to be able to focus more on strategy and development so it works well

AI: That's a really positive way to frame it - using AI to handle the more tedious or stressful parts so you can focus on higher-level strategic work. It sounds like you see it as freeing you up rather than replacing you.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: We're about to add in a much more custom CLM tool with a lot of AI function - this is going to free up a huge amount of manual work and stress for me and leave me to actually focus on the law

AI: That sounds like a significant step up from your current usage - moving from individual tasks to having AI integrated into your core legal workflows through the CLM system. It really reinforces what you mentioned about wanting to focus more on the actual legal strategy and analysis.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining control through detailed prompts and restrictions, and how you're strategically using AI to handle stress and tedium while preserving the human elements that matter most to you.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're thoughtfully integrating AI into legal work - especially balancing efficiency gains with maintaining professional standards and human connection - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
