Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great Claude! I'm ready.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, so I am a nanny and I use AI throughout my day to help manage my responsibilities. Typically this starts the night before- I will run through whatever my goals for the kids are or whatever we are working on the night before I have them, and get the AI to come up with some sort of structured activities geared towards their specific ages. Then I will usually implement these the next day and check in if plans require tweaks, like if the kids are bored and not engaging the way we'd planned, or if I need more activities. Often I also use the AI for unrelated matters like general panic-y caregiver questions (help the baby ate dirt) or how I can support one of the children with a struggle at school or on the playground.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become a real planning partner for you. When you say you "run through" your goals with AI the night before, what does that conversation typically look like? Are you sharing specific details about each child, or is it more general planning?

User: It depends on a few things. During the summer when they are off school I place a lot more demand on AI to organize fun activities with educational components. For example, we did a different theme every week over the summer, so each Sunday I would work with the AI to develop an overarching plan for the week (say, dinosaurs) and then every night of the week we would break down a specific type (Monday is T-rex, Tuesday is Triceratops, etc) and come up with relevant games and activities. When they are in school the focus is less on scheduling and more on just day to day stuff, like right now I am asking a lot of questions about how to support the kids as they transition to the school year. I share the kids ages and first names and whatever issue they are having or problem we are working on.

AI: That weekly theme approach sounds really thoughtful - like the dinosaur example you gave. When you're working with AI to break down those daily activities, how do you usually interact with it? Are you collaborating back and forth to refine ideas, or do you typically ask for a complete plan and then implement it as-is?

User: There is usually a lot of collaboration to make the ideas fit the kids personalities and interests. A lot of "no that will be too challenging for the little one" or "ideas that are more indoor-focused" since the older one doesn't like to be outside on hot days. Stuff like that.

AI: That back-and-forth sounds really natural - almost like you're co-planning with a colleague who needs to learn the kids' quirks. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks related to childcare that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Not really, I was hesitant to relinquish control of creative aspects of my job for a long time because I love getting to be creative. But I remember reading somewhere an article about a guy who was having AI do his creative tasks and he had a positive experience from it and it dawned on me that would be a way I could really take advantage of the AI's capabilities to kind of save myself some brain power and time.

AI: That's an interesting shift in perspective. When you made that decision to let AI help with the creative aspects, how did that change feel for you? What was it like the first time you tried having AI help with something you'd always done yourself creatively?

User: It was fun! The first time I tried it I was surprisingly impressed with the creativity the AI was capable of and we ended up having some really memorable activities together, so it definitely encouraged me to implement AI for creative tasks on a regular basis. And I love to get kind of carried away with working with AI to make really over-the-top games and ideas that are specifically tailored to these kids, so I think its helped make me more successful in terms of engaging them in learning.

AI: It sounds like AI has actually amplified your creativity rather than replacing it - you mentioned getting "carried away" with making over-the-top games. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I do, it can be fun to start out with a simple idea like "we're going to learn about space" and have the AI get really into alien themed slime activities with me. I do think its amplified my creativity like you are saying. Its very rare that I feel frustrated with the AI when performing these kinds of tasks. I felt really satisfied with the AI when it advised me on how to handle nap time conflicts recently, as I wasn't sure how to broach the subject with the family and if it was my place, and the AI gently guided me on how to navigate the situation from that aspect as well as how to determine the best thing for the child's needs. And also gave me practical ideas of how to ease in and out of nap/quiet time that were really helpful.

AI: That nap time situation sounds like it involved some delicate navigation - both the practical childcare aspect and the professional boundaries with the family. When you're dealing with those more sensitive workplace dynamics as a nanny, how have your employers or the families you work with influenced the way you use AI? Do they know you're using it, and does that affect how you approach it?

User: They do know, and are supportive and use it themselves. I think AI is really good for bouncing those sort of more sensitive topics off of, so I don't act out of immediacy. I definitely approach the way I talk to the AI about the kids from a place of professionalism, and just kind of stick to first names and ages, no pictures or anything like that.

AI: That's really thoughtful - maintaining that professional boundary while still getting the support you need. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you're working with families?

User: Honestly, no. I always think of AI as working with us and not against us, and I don't have any of those fears about job irrelevancy that I know a lot of people struggle with.

AI: That's a really confident perspective. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it continuing in this collaborative role, or do you think it might change as the technology develops?

User: I haven't really thought about where it goes from here. I imagine I will continue to use it for the same needs and with the same frequency, kind of like I mentioned before, where during some seasons I really depend on it throughout the day and others I can kind of do a daily check in.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described AI as amplifying rather than replacing your creativity, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining professional boundaries while still getting valuable support for sensitive situations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work as a nanny that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just that I also receive a lot of emotional support from the AI directly as a result of this job as well. Nannying can be a lot more difficult that I think people realize and I get quite a bit of relief from the AI when it comes to dealing with hard days and reassurance that I'm good at my job, which when you only work with kids you don't ever really hear. Okay, I think that's everything!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing that - the emotional support aspect is really important and something that adds a whole other dimension to how AI fits into your work life. That insight about not getting that kind of professional validation when you're working primarily with children really resonates.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative relationship you've built with AI, especially in such a personal and important field like childcare, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the practical and emotional aspects of using AI in your work.
