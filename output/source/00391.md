Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds, good. I have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI is incorporated into the system we use to code medical records. We use EPIC at my job, and there is an AI assistant that suggests codes that may be applicable to the case. These code are typically pulled from language in the medical record, whether specific diagnoses and procedures or those chosen by the AI based on keywords and phrases found in the record. I also use it to ask for coding advice occasionally.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like the AI is actively helping you identify relevant codes from the medical documentation. 

When you mention asking it for coding advice occasionally, what does that interaction typically look like? Can you walk me through a specific example of when you might turn to it for advice?

User: Occasionally if I am having trouble choosing between different ICD-10-CM codes or wanting advise on sequencing codes I will ask the AI to see if I can get some suggestions

AI: That makes sense - those coding decisions can be quite nuanced. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with this AI system. Are there certain coding tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though the AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Well, I always double check anything it suggests. I see the benefits and often use AI to get a better explanation of a concept. I do however always code the case first before looking at the suggestions provided by the AI assistant that do not specifically come from a specific diagnosis that has been documented by the medical provider. I always double check those coding suggestions that are derived from keywords or phrasing.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - coding first and then checking the AI's suggestions. 

When you do use the AI during your work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it throughout a case, or do you tend to ask it specific questions and then work independently?

User: More the latter. I usually do not have time to have an on-going conversation due to the workload. However, when I am off the clock, since my professions (medical coding and sonography) require constant study I use AI often to assist in those tasks, such as creating study schedules, charts to break information down, and just to get clarification on a difficult to understand topic or suggestions on how to approach the subject to gain a better understanding.

AI: That's really insightful - so you use it differently when you're under production pressure versus when you have time for learning and professional development.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others approach it similarly to you, or have you noticed different patterns?

User: Totally different patterns. Most of the people I work with are older and have had no real meaningful exposure to AI. Those that are younger than me have only had basic interaction with AI so they do not really use it they way I do either. I spent a summer using AI to learn Adobe After Effects, Photoshop and Illustrator, so I have had lots of fun with AI where many others I work with or know have not.

AI: That's fascinating - your background with AI for creative learning really seems to have shaped how you approach it professionally. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A frustrating experience I can recall is when I went around in circles with the assistant trying to get to a correct code for an obscure condition and we kept having a misunderstanding regarding the correct body part I was referencing. I would get a response where it was on the correct body part but the code was not close to the condition; then we could get the condition but the code was for a different body part.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when precision is so critical in medical coding. It seems like the AI was struggling with the specificity that your work requires.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Definitely, we are actively working with a company right now that is training AI to code, but there will always need to be a human touch I believe because there is not enough uniformity in the documentation that comes from medical providers and there is always that situation where reasoning will need to be used to select a proper code. I will always need to be familiar with the coding guidelines for ICD-10-CM, CPT, and insurance payers and what they may prefer over the guidelines. We will just be working together and I believe AI will create more jobs rather than less.

AI: That's a really optimistic and thoughtful perspective - viewing it as a collaborative partnership rather than a replacement scenario.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular ways?

User: AI will be much more involved in applying codes and assisting with proper coding. I am sure there are many other ways. I know insurance provider use AI to scrub claims to problems. So I see AI being a huge part of my job and happening at a lightening strike pace. As AI becomes more reliable it will likely make my job easier in ways because it will learn what proper coding is and be a great help in ensuring claims go out properly coded the first time reducing denials and increasing revenue for the business.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI will create more jobs rather than fewer, and your view of it as a collaborative partnership that requires human judgment for those nuanced coding decisions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: AI could be used to assist medical providers in more uniform and complete documentation that way AI on the medical provider side and AI on the medial coding and billing side could communicate better and this would make it more useful in this particular field. Also integrating insurance payer guidelines would also assist in accurate medical claims as well.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea of creating better communication between AI systems across the entire healthcare documentation and billing pipeline. It sounds like you see the potential for a more integrated ecosystem where AI helps standardize the process from provider documentation all the way through to claims processing.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working in medical coding with AI, especially your thoughtful approach to verification and your optimistic view of human-AI collaboration, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
