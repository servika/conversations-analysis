Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, and I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI only a couple to a few times per week. I usually use it because I run across a tedious task that is going to really slow me down otherwise. For example, if I realize that my students aren't quite where they should be on a topic and that we need to take another day on the material, I may decide to do some group work on the topic. To get the groups divided out, I'll use AI. I'll input names and give instructions like "I need these students divided into groups of 4. Don't let x work with y." Then do that for each class. Sometimes, I will need students sorted for who will be presenting which day, so I throw the information into ChatGPT. I could totally do it myself, but it would take so much longer and I could be doing something more requiring of my skillset instead.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using AI as a time-saver for those administrative tasks that would otherwise eat into your day. 

Tell me more about what you mean by "something more requiring of my skillset." What are those higher-value tasks you'd rather focus your time on?

User: Well, I'm a professor with both a teaching and research load. The time it takes to sort students when I decide to change my plans usually threatens to eat into time that I could use to conduct research, respond to emails from the department head, grade student papers, write for publication, or do class prep such as developing an assignment sheet.

AI: So it sounds like AI helps you protect your time for the core academic work - the research, writing, and teaching preparation that really draws on your expertise as a professor.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I would probably be able to have AI write assignment sheets and some of the course content, both for slides and Canvas. I don't use AI for those things because the one time I did, the AI made a slide that was all about claims and was mixing up claims and arguments. I didn't notice right away, then had to explain to my students in class why my slide had inaccurate information in it. I can make sure more easily that inaccurate information doesn't end up on my slides if I'm the one generating the information. I know it's a silly response to the situation because I could just edit more thoroughly, but it just doesn't seem like there is enough of a benefit to using AI tools in this way if I have to go over every inch of them for accuracy when they're done anyway, you know?

AI: That makes complete sense - you experienced firsthand how AI can introduce errors in your subject matter expertise, and then you had to deal with the consequences in front of your students. That's a pretty concrete reason to be cautious.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Honestly, I generally delegate complete tasks to be handled independently. I usually am using AI for the time saving element of it, so collaborating feels a little counterproductive to that purpose, to me. When I use AI for an event company that I own, and not for teaching/research, I am much more collaborative, because I'm more focused on idea generation than time saving.

AI: That's fascinating - so the purpose really drives how you interact with AI. For the tedious academic tasks, it's about efficiency and delegation, but for your event company, you're using it more as a creative partner.

Tell me more about that difference. What does the collaborative process look like when you're working on your event company versus the more hands-off approach you take with academic tasks?

User: So, I own a midsize LARP LLC. LARP companies are responsible for providing story lines for players to interact with. I usually come up with the main plot and NPCs without AI, but, when I need things called job boards (small plots for players to go on that need to be engaging but low-stakes) I will talk to ChatGPT about the larp and the theme of the event, then ask it to give me ideas for plots. Honestly, it's terrible at it. No matter how many times I explain that LARP isn't something where I can control the players or have them lose autonomy, ChatGPT always suggest plots where players would have to pretend to lose half of their memories or I would need to be able to read a players thoughts. But, it usually gives me enough information that I am able to then pull out useful parts of the idea and ask more questions to flesh out the stories.

AI: So even though ChatGPT doesn't quite grasp the constraints of LARP, it serves as a starting point that sparks your own creativity - you extract the useful pieces and build from there. That's a really different dynamic than just asking it to sort students into groups.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I am an assistant professor in the English program at a university. English professors and people in English departments have a lot of thoughts about AI use and they're not always well-researched. I embraced AI early because there were so many people in my field who hated it so much. It won't sound great, but I know how elitist higher ed can be. Anything that makes old-school professors so unanimously skeptical, to me, is probably something that will help underserved students. And I have, in fact, found that the time-saving elements of using AI for English classes does help students. So I continue to embrace AI to sort of push that point. I've even presented at conferences to spread the ways AI can be useful even in English programs.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI adoption through the lens of accessibility and equity for students. It sounds like you've positioned yourself as somewhat of a countervoice in your field.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt particularly frustrated when it produced that slide I mentioned earlier. It felt particularly satisfying when I was able to teach ESL students who were freshmen to talk to AI about their topics to catch up on the conversations happening in their fields so that they wouldn't have to spend extra time catching up instead of working on their papers. The students learned a lot and I got to talk to them about the fact that AI is a tool, not some evil thing that will get them kicked out the second they use it.

AI: That's a powerful example - helping ESL students level the playing field by using AI to quickly get up to speed on academic conversations. It sounds like you're helping students see AI as an equalizing tool rather than something to fear.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am struggling with the phrasing of your question. Do you want to know how I position myself knowing that my skills in some areas could be taken over by AI? Could you provide greater clarity and context so I could answer?

AI: Of course, let me clarify. I'm wondering about your approach to skill development - for instance, you mentioned you could use AI to create assignment sheets but choose not to because of accuracy concerns. Do you ever think about whether continuing to write those yourself helps you maintain or develop certain abilities? Or more broadly, do you consider how relying on AI for certain tasks might affect your own capabilities over time?

User: Thanks; that's a lot more clear. I do think about that sometimes. Honestly, the menial kinds of things I delegate aren't things I'm worried I'll get rusty at. If not dividing a list of names into groups of four for years makes it so that I can't do something so simple, then I have bigger problems. I have 4 degrees; I don't think those skills are going to fall away. As for whether I think I'm keeping my skills up by practicing things I could delegate to AI, I mean, of course that's keeping my skills up. Doing something is how you strengthen those skills. They aren't skills I'm worried I'll lose, but, I suppose, doing them does keep the skills sharp.

AI: That makes sense - you're not concerned about losing basic capabilities, and you're confident in your foundational skills from your extensive education and experience.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope that, when I'm more settled into academia (I just graduated with my PhD a few months ago), I'll maybe have time to collaborate with AI more. It would be nice to be able to take more time with anything, so AI use is no difference. I just feel rushed all of the time so my AI use reflects that. I hope to be able to occasionally not need to just unload tasks on AI and to be able to collaborate more deeply. For example, I do think that, given dedicated effort, I could get AI to understand LARP for that job, but I'm just always so busy that I have to take what I can get out of what AI says and move on.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as an equity tool for students and how your purpose - whether it's time-saving or creative collaboration - really shapes how you interact with these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: There is nothing else I feel a pressing need to share. Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for efficiency while being thoughtful about where human expertise really matters, and especially your perspective on AI as a tool for student equity, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
