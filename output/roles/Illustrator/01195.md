Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's go!

AI: Great! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Of course. I am an illustrator who currently focuses on medieval-woodcut inspired pen and ink illustrations. I sell prints online, in person at local art markets, and I accept commissions. I have been a working artist for over a decade now. I have previously worked 4 years as a professional tattoo artist, taking appointments and walk-in clientele, with a focus on American Traditional style tattoos. My typical projects are usually punk and nature inspired imagery, done with staedtler 1.2mm pens on paper, though I am looking to branch out into dip pens or even linocut/woodblock printing as my business grows.

AI: That's fascinating - I can really picture the aesthetic you're working with, combining that medieval woodcut style with punk and nature themes. The transition from tattooing to illustration sounds like an interesting journey too.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use a lot of large language models for assistance with website copy, drafting artist statements, brainstorming social media marketing, and sometimes (though rarely) illustration ideas. Basically, the more tedious and less creative parts of running an art business. I would rather be spending my time drawing. I will tap into an AI tool maybe a few times a week for creative assistance.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to handle the business side so you can focus on the actual drawing. It sounds like you've carved out pretty clear boundaries about where AI fits in.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I launched a new brand in June, so I had AI draft my website copy for me, though I did go in and edit it to sound more like my personal voice. I am a bit shy about admitting my use of AI to other creatives in my industry. Otherwise, most recently, I've put together some art supply lists.

AI: That's really interesting that you mention feeling shy about admitting AI use to other creatives. Tell me more about that - what's driving that feeling for you?

User: I understand that the use of AI does require a lot of environmental resources, and large scale data centers popping up are using a ton of fresh water and electricity. I'm very much concerned about climate change and its effects, so I do sometimes feel bad using it for quick jobs. However, I also recognize that there is a lot of incredible potential with certain AI tools. I hope in the near future, these environmental concerns can be addressed.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - weighing the practical benefits against those environmental concerns. It sounds like there's some internal tension there for you.

When you are working with AI on things like website copy or brainstorming, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I have a pretty clear idea of how I want my "brand" to look, what tone I'd like to use, and the style I'm looking to portray. But my mind isn't an endless well of creativity, sometimes I need that extra push to jumpstart my creative endeavors, and if I ask AI to lean into a certain voice (like, make my copy sound like a wizard, but more professional and less campy) I know that I can glean some ideas that I otherwise might have struggled to achieve on my own. Could I spend a lot of time simply googling and writing and editing on my own? Sure, but I'd much rather have a little extra help and save that time for my illustration.

AI: That wizard example is great - it really shows how you're using AI as a creative collaborator while staying firmly in the driver's seat. You're giving it very specific direction about tone and style.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Definitely perfecting my branding. I prefer to use my own natural brain to come up with illustration ideas, and I almost exclusively use large language models rather than image-generating models. But it's been a super helpful tool to make my website, my social media, and my business plan look and feel exactly how I want it to, and it's all cohesive. That's been the biggest impact for sure.

AI: That cohesiveness across all your business materials sounds like a huge win. It's interesting how AI has helped you nail down that brand voice and consistency.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Going back to the image-generating models, I am very concerned that AI-generated art will have a huge effect on my field. I think we're already seeing a lot of bad press about AI being trained on certain artists' work without their consent, and used to replicate their styles. I am concerned that people will gravitate towards the ease-of-use of image-generating models without considering the importance of art made with a human hand. I am also concerned about AI-generated images being used as reference material when it might contain glaring inaccuracies- imagine I ask for a tattoo design and I don't realize my portrait has six fingers. This might have already happened by now, who knows. Yikes. I'd rather the role of AI be used to reduce the tedious workload of humanity so that we have enough time to focus on making art, writing poetry, etc.

AI: That six-finger tattoo scenario is both funny and genuinely concerning! Your vision of AI handling tedious work so humans can focus on art and poetry really resonates - it sounds like that's exactly how you're trying to use it in your own practice.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Well, I think I will stick to the large language models for myself and my work, personally. I don't think I will ever transition into using image or video-generating models. At least not with the current environmental impacts. I do hope humanity and AI can learn to coexist in a way that's beneficial. But in my personal work, I will continue to use AI to refine my brand, take the annoyances out of keeping inventory, build restock lists, manage my website, and give me advice to push my content out into this whacky world wide web.

AI: That's a really clear vision - using AI as your business assistant while keeping the creative work firmly in your own hands. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to handle the business side so you can focus on what you love most - the actual drawing - and your nuanced view of the environmental concerns balanced against the practical benefits.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that clear boundary between AI as a business tool versus keeping the creative work human, along with your thoughtful approach to the environmental considerations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really fascinating to hear how you've carved out such a intentional role for AI in your practice. Best of luck with your illustration work and that potential expansion into linocut and woodblock printing!
