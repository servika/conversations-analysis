Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a teacher, I don't use AI during every workday, but I do use it mostly when writing lesson plans- for help with generating lesson ideas, or I'll occasionally ask it to write worksheet questions or test questions. I know some schools are doing teacher professional development (training) about how to integrate AI into the classroom, but my district hasn't offered this. It seems like it's pretty controversial, and many parents wouldn't like it being used.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're navigating both the practical benefits and the broader concerns around AI in education. 

When you're working on those lesson plans and generating ideas, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you decide when to bring AI into that work versus handling it on your own?

User: If I have to write an entirely new lesson, worksheet, or test, that's when I'll ask for assistance. As an example, I will know what question I need to ask but I'll ask AI to give me four multiple choice options with one being correct. This cuts down on time spent doing these repetitive tasks.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI for those more mechanical parts while you handle the core content decisions. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of lesson planning or teaching preparation that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks feel different to you?

User: My preference is to do as much as possible by myself, I don't want AI making decisions about what content is taught. And like I said before, using it in a classroom isn't always accepted. But- teaching requires so much work outside of normal work hours. Sometimes I'm up until midnight writing an assignment, or grading, or entering grades into powerschool. Anything I can do to cut down on that time spent while still making sure the students are getting the content they need, I'll do it.

AI: That really captures the tension you're dealing with - wanting to maintain control over the educational content while also managing those demanding hours that extend well beyond the school day.

When you do use AI for those time-saving tasks like creating multiple choice options, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine what you need, or do you tend to give it a complete request and then work with what it gives you?

User: I'll definitely check it and refine it if it isn't what I need. Sometimes it doesn't write questions on the correct grade level, or sometimes it will say things that don't make sense at all. Checking and refining are important.

AI: That quality control process sounds crucial, especially when you're thinking about what your students will encounter.

How have your colleagues or your school's culture influenced the way you approach using AI in your work? You mentioned earlier that it can be controversial - how does that play out in your day-to-day experience?

User: We haven't been either encouraged or discouraged to use it as a tool in the classroom. So that means some colleagues are totally against it, and some use it more than I do. It would be nice to get some guidance from admin, and also some training or professional development so we aren't guessing about what's appropriate.

AI: That uncertainty about what's appropriate really comes through - it sounds like you're all figuring it out individually without clear guidelines.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The most frustration comes from when you can tell that students are using AI to complete assignments, such as not reading an assigned book and instead asking AI directly each question and copying the answer. Or having it write entire essays. It's easy to tell when this is happening, but not easy to prove.

AI: That's a really compelling perspective - experiencing frustration with AI not from your own use of it, but from how students are using it in ways that undermine the learning process you're trying to create.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you decide when and how to use these tools?

User: Yes, I definitely consider it, and I need more education about it. I guess it's time to seek out books about integrating AI into classrooms, what tools are useful, and how to deal with student use of AI as well.

AI: It sounds like you're really thoughtful about finding that balance - using AI as a helpful tool while staying sharp on your core teaching skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What do you think that might look like as you learn more and potentially as your district provides more guidance?

User: The main thing that I hope for myself, is to use it as a time saver. It has already helped me to save time in some ways, but I'm sure there's more that can be done that I haven't even thought about. Also ideally we would get guidance and education that's clear about district expectations. That way if we get a parent complaint- for example, they think an assignment was written by AI and they don't like that, we would have the backing of the district. But te main thing that I'd hope for myself, is to use it as a time saver. It has already helped me to save time in some ways, but I'm sure there's more that can be done that I haven't even thought about.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're navigating the need to save time while maintaining educational integrity, and how the lack of clear guidance creates this challenging middle ground for teachers.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing we haven't already covered!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with educational responsibility, and the challenges of operating without clear institutional guidance, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
