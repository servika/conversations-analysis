Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use AI to rewrite emails and paragraphs in reports for clarity and tone. After I see the AIs response I merge it with my original text in. I usually end up with about 70% the original wording and 30% AI. A few issues I have is although the texts are largely professional in nature I feel that most AI is over the top professional. Another minor task I use AI for is research, if there is an engineering topic I don't know about I'll ask AI (usually Deepseek) and it will give a good overview of a topic and point in the right direction for further research. Lastly I use it to design Excel calculators, I'd like it to be able to design the Excel sheets themselves instead of me having to paste formulas into excel.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow you've described - taking the AI's suggestions and blending them with your original voice. 

Tell me more about that balance you mentioned with the tone being "over the top professional." What does that look like in practice, and how do you decide which parts to keep versus which parts to dial back?

User: Well I'll give you an example if I write "Can you write this email to a fellow engineer? "Hey Stephanie, See the attached stamped drawings, I've suggest we use a smaller profile roofing and confirm that we require forest green as the colour. If you have any questions or comments let me know.

Cheers,
[REDACTED]"

It will say something along the lines of 

"Hi Stephanie,

I've reviewed the stamped drawings (attached) and have two key updates:

Roofing Profile: I am recommending we use a smaller profile roofing system than previously specified.

Colour: Please confirm that forest green is the final colour selection we need to proceed with.

Could you please review these points at your convenience? I'm happy to discuss further if you have any questions or comments.

Best regards,

[Your Name]"

I may borrow the bullet points for clarity, but the rest of the suggestion is overly professional and not how I communicate at all. If I were cold emailing someone I didn't know, I would email that way, but I have an existing relationship with most people I work with.

AI: That's such a perfect example - you can really see how the AI transformed your casual, direct style into something much more formal. It sounds like the AI doesn't pick up on the existing relationship context you have with Stephanie.

When you're doing that blending process - taking maybe the bullet points but keeping your more casual tone - how do you typically approach that? Do you rewrite it from scratch using the AI's structural ideas, or do you go line by line mixing and matching?

User: I generally go sentence by sentence mixing and matching, sometimes I know one of my sentences is a run on sentence so i specifically ask it to break that in 2, Or combine to sentences in to one. I usually know when one of my sentences isn't great, that when I ask AI to fix it up.

AI: That's really insightful - so you're using AI almost like a targeted editor for specific sentences you already know need work, rather than having it rewrite everything wholesale.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to do everything myself in order to improve, but sometimes I'm aware my ability to communicate clearly is lacking, that's when I use AI to improve it and as a check. I also prefer to use AI for mundane tasks like setting up spreadsheets. I use it to initiate research, but I always double check everything and enjoy completing the research myself.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI as a starting point for research but then diving deeper yourself. It sounds like you're very intentional about maintaining and developing your own skills.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'll collaborate when necessary, but I usually give it specific tasks and refine the answers if necessary.

AI: So you're more in delegation mode - giving it specific, bounded tasks rather than going back and forth throughout the process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches around you?

User: Haha good question some people use solely to make funny pitures, a few other use it similar to me to improve and check writing. Someone else suggested that's it's great to pinpoint the locations of answer to question in standards manuals. I've used it that way and it works great.

AI: Ha! I love that range - from funny pictures to navigating technical standards manuals. That's quite a spectrum of use cases in one workplace.

That standards manual application sounds really practical. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was writing a short, one paragraph, biography for a proposal and after a few iterations it came it really good. When I sent it off the client was impressed with the clear writing. I haven't seen it come close to that level of clarity and persuasive writing since.

AI: That's a great success story - especially getting that positive feedback from the client! It sounds like that biography really hit the mark.

You mentioned it hasn't reached that same level of clarity and persuasive writing since then. What do you think made that particular interaction work so well compared to other times?

User: I think the complexity of the writing paired with the collaboration was what made it great. Usually most of my email are generic and aren't made to be persuasive one way or the other, but the biography really allowed my story and AI to shine.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like when you had something more creative and narrative to work with, the collaboration really clicked in a way that routine emails just don't allow for.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really I'm not as convince about AI as other. I'm aware of it's limitations and I don't think it was ever take over my job. I think of it as a really good spell check/ calculator/search engine and nothing more. It's a tool to improve my work, but those things aren't going to replace my job. I always practice my skills prior to consulting the AI as a check.

AI: That's a grounded perspective - treating it as a sophisticated tool rather than a replacement. It sounds like you've found a balance where you're getting value from AI while staying confident in your own capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops, or are you pretty satisfied with how you're incorporating it now?

User: I wish I could be more confident in some of it's task, I always double check everything it does so it doesn't save too much time. I would like to be able to use it in Civil 3d and to be able to make it write clear complete specifications, but it's not at that level yet. Also I'd like it be integrated with Excel better to be able to produce calculators for me for my civil engineering tasks.

AI: Those are really specific, practical improvements that would clearly add value to your workflow - especially the Civil 3D integration and having it actually build those Excel calculators rather than just providing formulas to paste in.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a sophisticated tool rather than a replacement, and how you've found that sweet spot of collaboration on more complex writing tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really, I don't think AI will ever reach AGI on standard computers, I think we'll need to wait for quantum computer to higher levels maybe like 1 Million Qbits or more before we'll be even close to AGI.

AI: That's an interesting technical perspective on the hardware requirements for more advanced AI capabilities. It sounds like you have a pretty clear view of both the current limitations and what it might take to push beyond them.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI as a tool while maintaining your own skills, and your practical examples of what works well versus what still needs improvement, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your workflow and approach!

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
