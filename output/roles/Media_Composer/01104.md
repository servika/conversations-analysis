Assistant: Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nice! I think I'm good for questions. Let's get into it.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Hmmm— I'm a media composer. That means I write music for film, tv, video artwork, installations, etc. I also write standalone pieces but that's much more occasional. Depending on the project I and scope I do everything from sound design to recording but my main skill is composing.

AI: That sounds fascinating - composing across so many different media formats must present unique creative challenges for each one.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI tools for brainstorming, asking quick questions about technique and theory, general admin, copywriting, emails/comms, and also business planning.

AI: Tell me more about the brainstorming part - what does that look like when you're working on a composition?

User: Oh I should mention I also use some machine learning mixing plugins like iZotope Ozone and Sonible Smart:EQ. Anyway— brainstorming is and ideation is really just a process of bouncing my ideas off a peer. Sometimes it's talking through creative blocks and trying to clarify my vision.

AI: That's really interesting - you're describing AI almost like a creative collaborator you can bounce ideas off of. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: This wasn't a client project but I've been using AI to critically analyse film scores. It's been good to get the creative thinking flowing. Basically I've been asking AI to help write out an essay on  something like the film Arrival and what made the score by Johannsson so unique.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI to help you analyze and articulate what works in other composers' music. When you're having those conversations with AI about Jóhannsson's score for Arrival, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative insights and analysis?

User: It was fun but also it helped me refine my own perspective somewhat. I was just sending through articles from the composer and suggesting other connections that might be considered.

AI: That sounds like you were maintaining a lot of creative control - using AI to help explore and refine ideas that you were already developing. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'm honestly doing a lot my "bucket filling" (that's what a mentor calls it). Just digging into broad topics and synthesising ideas. I don't know if these have actuated in the work yet but I imagine it's only a matter of time.

AI: That's a great way to put it - "bucket filling." It sounds like you're in an investment phase right now, building up this broader knowledge base that will eventually feed into your compositions. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Well certainly for composers making "production" music it's a big problem. I also am pretty concerned about how AI generated music might impact streaming platform saturation. The other thing that concerns me is how VOD streaming platforms might leverage AI tech along with their publishing libraries infinitely generate new music.

AI: Those are some really specific and concrete concerns about the industry landscape. It sounds like you're seeing potential threats both to composers who work in certain commercial segments and to the broader music ecosystem through platform manipulation.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I actually don't know. It'll certainly make the non-creative aspects less tedious. Hopefully it'll be able to help me refine my ideas and speed up my workflow.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI for "bucket filling" - that investment in broader knowledge and synthesis - and your nuanced view of AI's industry impact, from the very practical workflow benefits to the serious concerns about commercial music production and platform saturation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so. Take it easy!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Take care!
