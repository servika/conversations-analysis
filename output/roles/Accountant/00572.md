Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, please begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For my 'bricks & mortar' job, I use AI not as a formal part of my tasks, I use my own AI accounts (ChatGPT and Gemini) for various things.  Drafting e-mails occasionally (I do payroll, so it is handy to run a few drafts of communications to employees).  It is also very handy for researching software procedures (Quickbooks, Excel) so much faster than looking them up, and also great for troubleshooting.  So mostly research and assistance with processes.  Also great for tax questions.  Especially if an employee has a tax question, it is helpful to use AI to draft an explanation that is more coherent for the average person.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a research and communication assistant in several key ways. 

Tell me more about how you decide when to use AI for drafting those employee communications versus writing them yourself. What influences that choice?

User: For communications, if it's complicated.  As an accouting person, I tend to use too much jargon, so I write my first draft and ask it to make it more comprehensible to someone not familiar with tax laws/procedures/the IRS, etc.  Employees thus don't end up getting MORE confused from my e-mails!

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a translation tool to bridge that expertise gap. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Frankly, I think the tasks I don't use AI for are just because I don't know the full capabilities of the AI! Can they do things like fill in payroll accounting entries in our qccounting software using the excel sheets we pull from payroll?  It would be great to automate that.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - so it sounds like you're actually quite open to AI assistance and the main barrier is just not knowing what's possible yet.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate throughout the task.  I don't have a lot of 'start to finish' tasks, but if I learned more about the AI capabilities I bet I could find something to do .  Are there AI functions for payroll and accounting?

AI: I can see you're really curious about those possibilities! But let me stay focused on understanding your current experience for now.

You mentioned collaborating throughout tasks - can you walk me through what that back-and-forth typically looks like when you're working with AI on something like drafting an employee communication or researching a software procedure?

User: I ask a question like, 'How does maximum 401k contribution work for an employee with salary $X dollars and turned 56 on June 3rd, 2025.  What is their max contribution allowed for 2025?
After that question is answered, I then ask for a simple explanation for someone.  Often, the answer will provide an explanation anyway, but I will put in particulars and then ask for a few versions and pick the one I think works best.

AI: That's a great example of the iterative process you use. It sounds like you start with getting the technical details right, then refine the communication aspect.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they know you're using these tools, and what's their reaction?

User: It's funny, there is no formal recognition, but it is funny when someone comes into my office with a question and I say, 'Let's ask the AI' and they laugh like that's crazy, but then I show them the answer, and remind to fact check, but I just say the AI is a great 'first stop' to at least get an idea on questions, and of course you can ask the AI for sources to backup!

AI: That's such an interesting dynamic - they think it's funny at first but then see the value when you demonstrate it. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I was a little frustrated was on an IRS question where chatGPT acted like it knew the answer but actually didn't.  It took a while to just get to finding the appropriate IRS form I could find the info on.  It seemed it was trying to give me an answer, ANY answer, rather than just say it was too complicated to cover.

AI: That sounds frustrating - when the AI gave you confidence in an answer that wasn't actually reliable. It sounds like you learned to be more cautious about fact-checking after that experience.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI is very good at dealing with things already there, but not so good at coming up with new ones.  So, as I learn more ways to use AI to free up my own time and energy, I can develop new ideas and processes that make our overall business run better.  Getting bogged down in some tasks takes away time that could go into improving everything.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - using AI to handle the routine work so you can focus on innovation and improvement. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It will start to become more 'embedded' in my work, like, automatic, and part of the standard procedures, as opposed to now when it is more an 'extra'.

AI: That vision of AI becoming embedded rather than an "extra" tool is really insightful.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to free up time for developing new ideas and processes rather than seeing it as competition for your skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I mentioned payroll, so one thing I will need more education on is AI security to protect employee information.

AI: That's such an important point about security considerations, especially when dealing with sensitive employee data. Thank you for bringing that up - it's a crucial aspect of AI adoption in workplace settings that we need to understand better.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research assistant, the iterative collaboration process you've developed, and your vision of AI becoming more embedded in standard procedures will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the challenges you've encountered. Have a great rest of your day!
