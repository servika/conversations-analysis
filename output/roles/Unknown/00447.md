Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, we can begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I've used it primarily in the creation of spreadsheets. For example, there have been times when I need to track certain information relating to hiring or other data sets I need to share with the employees and I need a spreadsheet to contain certain formulas. I might not always be up on the necessary formulas to get the spreadsheet to organize my data the way I want, or I may have forgotten, if I haven't created that type of spreadsheet in a while or have been using my old templates for a long time, so in tools such as Google sheets for example, I will try and collaborate with the AI there to help design what I need in order to save me time trying to figure out how to create the spreadsheet I need.

AI: That's a really practical use case. When you say you "collaborate with the AI" in Google Sheets to design what you need - can you walk me through what that interaction typically looks like?

User: So using my specific use case example, I would open a new spreadsheet in Google sheets and ask Gemini to create a spreadsheet that does what I need it to do, for example, dynamically alphabetize all rows by column B.

AI: Tell me more about how that process unfolds from there. Once you make that initial request to Gemini, what happens next in your workflow?

User: From my past experience, it usually takes a couple times before I feel like Gemini understands what I want, even if its something that I feel is simple, and once I feel it does, it will usually offer me some options to select. However, for the most part I haven't found many of them to be correct. Usually the tables suggested don't exactly do what I need or are missing key integration elements that prevent me from readily using the spreadsheet as I imagined without having to take the time to educate or reeducate myself externally anyway. in other words, I never find it as intuitive or as 'point and click' as I am expecting. For tasks that are done more sporadically like maybe once every couple months, just being able to say "I want a spreadsheet that does this..." and have it be done would shorten my time between creative imagination and reality and make my workflow so much smoother. I guess, till now, the AI integration never seems to be the labor saving device that I am envisioning, it seems far too complex on the front end if htat makes sense.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's this gap between what you're hoping for and what you're actually getting. When you mention it being "far too complex on the front end," it sounds like you're spending more time trying to communicate what you want than you'd spend just figuring it out yourself.

Given those experiences, how do you decide whether to try using AI for a spreadsheet task or just tackle it on your own?

User: well the deciding factor for me is, if Im spending three tries trying to get the AI to deliver what I want and then having to worry about my specific prompting, even when I am very explicit and direct, to achieve its desired output, then I could do a quick web search and likely find people asking a similar question to what I need or a video and read through several webpages and forum threads in that same time to just teach myself how to do it. Like, if it takes me ten minutes to get the AI to do what I need, I can just learn it in 10 minutes and then create a step by step instruction sheet for myself if this is a non regular recurring task. And I can do this for everything, its just ideally faster if I could theoretically use an AI to get me there and saves the necessity of me saving and organizing tons of instruction sets for myself for all these type of tasks. I think of it like GPS. before GPS I used to have to plot my route beforehand, and make sure I had maps with me, organize and store those maps and pull over during my drive so I could consult the map, alwasy keep an eye oand thought tuned towards the map and be conscious of my landmarks and surroundings. Once I got GPS in my car and phone, I could route to a destination instantly and gain an approximation of destination and travel time whenever I needed it, like during planning a trip, and once I got in the car, I simplyu entered a simple destination and I was brought to my destination with multiple accessible routes everytime. Seemlessly, repetitively, flawlessly. This alleviated the entire burden of navigation for me and all the tools and resources that went along with that and make navigation instantaneous and contained in a small portable device. This meaningfully saved quantifiable time and have a measureable improvement in my effectiveness by allowing me to do what I do best, executive and creative decision making, while the GPS did what it does best handle quantification and remembering lots of data. Together we exponentially improved our effectiveness. I have not felt that same benefit with AI use in the workplace. It feels like AI wants to interact too much on my level of world interaction and is not refined enough to handle its tasks, the things I either cant do or dont want to do. To put it plainly, I dont need ideas as much as I need something to execute the ideas I have so I can iterate  those ideas faster .

AI: That GPS comparison is really illuminating - you're looking for that same kind of seamless, reliable execution where you input what you want and it just works, letting you focus on the higher-level thinking.

It sounds like right now, AI feels more like having to negotiate with a partner who doesn't quite understand the assignment, rather than having a tool that just executes your vision. When you say "I don't need ideas as much as I need something to execute the ideas I have" - that really captures something important about what you're looking for from AI at work.

Have you found any tasks or situations where AI has come closer to that GPS-like experience for you?

User: Unfortunately, I haven't found any tasks or situations where AI has come closer to that GPS like experience for me

AI: That's a pretty clear picture then. Given that experience, how do your colleagues or your workplace culture influence the way you approach AI tools? Do you see others having similar experiences, or are people around you using AI differently?

User: I'm not sure to be honest. I tend to have a fair amount of autonomy in my department so I don't know how similar positions in other departments are making use of AI tools, but I have not heard much specific conversation about it. I find that I tend to be more forward thinking in the realm of integrating technology to improve work related outcomes, however. For example, I make wide use of macros and simple automation to simplify tasks and Im not aware that any of my peers do.

AI: That's interesting - you're already someone who actively looks for ways to use technology to streamline work, with things like macros and automation, but AI hasn't delivered that same kind of practical benefit yet.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the spreadsheet example I gave earlier stood out to me because that was particularly frustrating. If Im doing a lot of spreadsheet work, I tend to just educate myself for the specific task at hand, but then in my daily work I will default to using templates I've saved or prexsisting shared documents. So after a large hiring push I had a large number of new employees and supervisors and noticed that the supervisors were missing critical data that they needed to make sure the employees were saying the correct information. I needed to create a shared spreadsheet that I could dynamically update multiple times a day that also needed to oragnize the data in a certain way every time I added new information. This is a simple task for someone who is more of a daily spreadsheet power user, but It had been months for me  and I had forgotten how to structure a spreadsheet to do that. So specifically in that instance I needed somehting to work the way I needed it to and quickly so i could address an issue I was noticing in real time. This is a perfect example where AI could have been so beneficial and allowed me to get what I needed instantly at the moment I saw a need. I specifically turned to AI becasue I was worried it might take me too long to educate myself and I needed to solve this problem now. However, it took several prompts and still it never organized the data the way I needed it too. SO I ended up just disseminating the spreadsheet unorganized and then taking some time later in the day to reducate myself on the appropriate formulas and fixing the spreadsheet myself.

AI: That's such a perfect example of where AI could have been transformative but fell short exactly when you needed it most. You had a real-time problem that needed solving, and instead of being your GPS equivalent, AI became another obstacle between you and the solution.

It sounds like you ended up having to send out the unorganized version and then circle back to fix it properly later - so the immediate need your supervisors had wasn't fully met in that moment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes I do consider that. And thats a very important thing. I think we have reached a level of complexity in technology that It may be long past that point. What I mean by that is, I belive there are essential skills relevant to biological organisms that are essential to maintain. Unfortunatley, we have let many of these skills lapse. In terms of computer technology skills not essential to biological survival, there are already a small handful of people who can understand those skills and practice them and that number is shrinking all the time as our computer technology gets more sophisticated. I think the only way out is through so to speak. For example, there is alwasy concern over Google's curation of data in its search results with its heavy algorithmic governance however, the flip side to that is there is so much data out there, it becomes an impossiblity to find the meaningful thing you want or need without some sort of management and specific targeting of that data. Its a nice thought to search for things in the 'old way' but when you have billions of hits, your ability to sort through that data becomes an impossibility and so like it or not, the two first pages of Google become necessary. It is the same with tech. We are already at the point where the skillset available to the masses is the operation of said tech but the development without specialized knowledge is much more rare and the barrier to entry gets higher provided we are talking abotu a broadcast approach. Once we get to the integration of hardware and software, the skill pool becomes smaller and once we get to the development of new hardware and specific hardware elements, the skill pool is extremely small. So bearing all that in mind, as long as we heavily use and rely on computer technology and want to increase and get more complex in what computer technology can do, it makes sense to hand off those 'skills' to a machine that can manage such a vast repository of data and allow us to integrate with said machines in a complimentary way rather than a competitive way. So, no I'm not as worried about maintaining my skills in an obsolete area if a machine can get me to the place I need to be faster than me manually doing it, however, I am worried about use creating enough redundancy and accessibility so that fi we hand off these 'skills' to a machine that it serves to be accessible all the time and reasonably for as long as we  exist and that it serves to increase quality of life for the majority of people rather than decrease it. That is a very existential answer to what may have been intended as a more surface level question. So I will address it from a more surface level now: In terms of what that means for me wiht the thought of "Will AI take my job?", Yes I think automation and specifically AI does threaten many jobs, and I think a lot of the workforce wont necessarily have the skills to compete in decades to come, but I guess that I'm hoping, perhaps naively so, that it may lessen human labor and increase productivity and hopefully we can all benefit from that. At least the potential may be for individuals to benefit by greater independence. but I am not sure how it will all play out. In terms of maintaining the ability to navigate without the GPS, to use an analogy, I think its important to maintain the underlying principles, but as mentioned, there is a threshold of complexity that we can reach where the skillsets necessary to maintain along the way are too great to reasonably do, so redundancy and accessibility are critical at that point, not maintaining skills if there are too many levels to work back to the beginning should we/I need to start over if that makes sense.

AI: That's a remarkably thoughtful perspective - you're thinking about this on multiple levels, from the practical "will this make my work better" to these deeper questions about technological dependence and societal impact. Your point about redundancy and accessibility being more critical than maintaining obsolete skills once we cross certain complexity thresholds really stands out.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Given where you are now and what you've described about wanting that GPS-like reliability, what would need to change for you to find AI more useful?

User: I think AI has great potential within the workplace specifically for smaller or independent businesses where it could serve as a means to accomplish tasks where workers or owners may lack skillset. I believe that will have to be the point at which businesses find it essential to integrate. I think, personally, that AI becoming more specific and specialized in its execution might be an important element and then tying it all together with a more conversational interface that serves as an translator of sorts from our common parlance to what the specific machine needs to execute. In other words, it feels like with workplace integration theres possibly too much discussion going on with the AI as opposed to the conversational AI serving as a mediator to take my needs and translate them to an AI that can execute them in a specialized way. Thats the first thing that comes to mind. However, bear in mind I am limited by my experience and I have learned that we can often find other ways of doing things we have never thought of before that may indeed be better. I do think that the point of integration mroe like a tool that responds to plain speech rather than a companion might be the starting point of greater integration.

AI: That vision of AI as more of a translator or intermediary - where you'd speak naturally to one interface that then coordinates with specialized execution engines behind the scenes - that's a compelling way to think about it. Rather than trying to negotiate directly with the AI that's supposed to do the work, you'd have that conversational layer that truly understands what you need and can orchestrate the right specialized tools to deliver it seamlessly.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your GPS analogy and your perspective on how AI could evolve to be more like a specialized tool with a conversational interface rather than trying to be a collaborative partner.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, those are all my primary thoughts in terms of my experience in the workplace use of AI at this moment

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about wanting execution over collaboration, the importance of reliability and seamlessness, and your vision for how AI could evolve to be more useful - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you approached these questions, from the practical day-to-day challenges right up to the broader implications of technological dependence. Thanks again for participating in this interview.
