Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No - that's all good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I tutor students to help them through their maths exams in the UK. Often I will use AI to help introduce different methods to solving problems.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to expand your teaching toolkit. When you say you use it to introduce different methods for solving problems, what does that process typically look like for you? Are you asking the AI to generate alternative approaches, or something else?

User: Yes - most problems can be solved with a variety of method and students are different in their preferences. I want AI to not only give me the various approaches, but also a step by step, clear and simple, application of the approach.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - tailoring the approach to match how different students think. When you get those step-by-step breakdowns from AI, how do you typically use them with your students? Do you present the AI-generated methods directly, or do you adapt them in some way first?

User: No - I will go with what I think will work best. Sometimes AI uses complicated maths to solve a problem when it could be solved using more accessible maths.

AI: Ah, so you're filtering and curating what the AI gives you based on your knowledge of what will actually work for each student. Tell me more about how you make those judgment calls - what helps you decide when the AI's approach might be too complicated versus just right for a particular student?

User: I generally know what the student already knows and what they have covered.

AI: That's a really important distinction - your knowledge of each individual student's background. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I use AI to ensure I have a comprehensive and complete appreciation of all possible solution methods - without that, I may introduce a sub-optimal method for the student. If the student is strong - being introduced to different approaches is good - but if they are weak, it is best to just show them one approach that they can use.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI to expand your own repertoire while still making the pedagogical decisions yourself. So it sounds like the actual teaching and deciding which method to use with which student - that's something you keep firmly in your hands. 

When you're working with AI to get those comprehensive solution methods, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete request and let it handle that independently?

User: Often, there needs to be a back and forth to arrive at a desirable outcome

AI: What typically drives that back and forth? Is it the AI not quite understanding what level you need, or something else that requires you to refine your requests?

User: Sometimes the AI doesn't quite understand the level - or is not as precise as I want it to be ( e.g preliminary rounding of answers leading to a compounding rounding error)

AI: That precision issue sounds frustrating - especially in maths where those compounding errors can really throw students off. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other tutors using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this more on your own?

User: I am a teacher and all teacher's have their own style. Also the teacher needs to understand the student and what they can handle or not. I have always taught students to use exact calculations as much as they can, and round only at the final answer. Other teacher's may be different.

AI: That's a really good point about individual teaching styles. So it sounds like your approach to AI is very much shaped by your own pedagogical philosophy - like your preference for exact calculations. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I use AI a lot because it is quick - but it does have to be carefully checked for mistakes or inconsistencies. I would never use it 'blindly' (although it is developing quickly) at the moment. I think if used 'blindly' it could lead to frustrating situations, but it is certainly a massive enabler.

AI: That "massive enabler" phrase is really striking - it captures both the power and the responsibility you feel when using it. You mentioned you'd never use it blindly at the moment. How do you think about maintaining your own mathematical skills and judgment in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's already able to do all the Maths, but the judgement of what to use when is much more personalised to the student and the relationship between student and teacher. But, yes, one day, strong students won't need teachers in the same way - weaker one's, however, probably will because there is more to learning than just the content. Can AI give the student the confidence they need to succeed?

AI: That's such a profound insight - the distinction between delivering content and building confidence. It sounds like you see AI potentially changing the teacher's role, especially for stronger students, but that human element of confidence-building remaining essential for others.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your own relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your approach will change as the technology develops?

User: Yes - I will use it more and more

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a "massive enabler" for expanding your teaching methods, while the crucial judgment about what approach works for each individual student remains firmly in your hands.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI's computational power with the deeply human aspects of teaching - like building student confidence and making those nuanced pedagogical decisions - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
