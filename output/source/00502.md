Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Go for it

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use chatbots to brainstorm approaches to projects, and I use cursor as my primary IDE to execute on tasks. I use it for most of my technical tasks like building data pipelines and developing models.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI both for the conceptual side with brainstorming and the execution side with your development work. 

When you say you use it for "most" of your technical tasks, can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? How do you typically work with your AI tools when you're building those data pipelines or developing models?

User: Sometimes I will write what I want coded in plain english almost like pseudocode and basically let the bot just take care of the syntax, and other times I write code manually and ask the bot to improve or simplify it. I find that a lot of my time is spent just reviewing what the bots write.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - it sounds like you're switching between different modes of collaboration depending on the situation. 

You mentioned that a lot of your time is spent reviewing what the bots write. What does that review process actually look like for you? What are you typically checking for or thinking about during those reviews?

User: Number 1 checking that the logic is sound and it's doing what I asked it do, but also going over its syntax, naming, comments, etc to get rid of the fluff it tends to generate and to make sure it sticks to my team's general conventions. I also often have to stop it when it goes down a rabbit hole of phrases like "wait, I need to change this approach"

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a keen sense for when the AI is getting off track with those self-correction loops. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't use bots in communication like emails and teams messages because I find it impersonal and unnecessary, and I don't use it to review or finalize mine or others' code because if it misses something then I'm still responsible for it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing clear boundaries around tasks that require personal touch or ultimate accountability.

When you are using AI for those technical tasks like building pipelines, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Like I said I don't allow it complete independence because I still am held responsible for code I write and review, but I defer to it mainly after I've sketched out logic to it and just need to execute, and then after it writes the code, I review and refine it so it fits my standards. Basically the interaction is I feed it context and logic, it drafts, I review or iterate, and this loop continues until a task is done.

AI: That's a really clear picture of your iterative process - context and logic from you, draft from AI, then your review and refinement in a loop.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: My workplace culture is AI forward with boundaries and human responsibility. My team encourages use of tools like cursor but without complete deference. So we use it insofar as it makes us more efficient but we don't allow a complete AI takeover of our work.

AI: That sounds like a really balanced approach your team has developed. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was frustrated recently because the cursor assistant refused to abide by some of our syntax and naming standards we have mapped out in our cursor rules. It's not a make or break thing but it slows things down so it's frsutrating.

AI: That's a really concrete example of friction - when the tool isn't respecting the guardrails you've set up, it actually creates more work instead of less.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think AI can fully take over my profession and others like it; I think it eliminates the low performers and empowers the high performers. So I consider the evolution and try to maximize my own reliability in the places where AI has gaps.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on skill evolution rather than replacement. You're focusing on where you can be most reliable in those gap areas.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it stays the same as I've explained my current workflow and the predictive capabilites get marginally better. Over time, I fear I will become over-reliant on the bots and lose ability to manually do certain things but I think that's somewhat inevitable.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI empowers high performers rather than replacing them, and your very structured approach to maintaining accountability while leveraging AI's capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
