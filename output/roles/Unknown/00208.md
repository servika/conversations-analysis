Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, happy to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI for basic content creation and ideation, from which I then refine and create finalised documents. My role involves a lot of planning and 'formal' documents so an example would be getting AI to help with common sections of a stakeholder engagement plan, or common ways to overcome resistance within a team

AI: That's really helpful context. When you mention getting AI to help with those common sections or strategies for overcoming resistance, could you walk me through what that process actually looks like for you day-to-day? 

Tell me more about how you go from that initial AI input to your finalized documents.

User: The initial question I ask would provide some context about the environment I'm in (for example, the size of the team, the type of change, and why people are resisting it) and a request for AI to brainstorm some helpful solutions.

I would review these solutions to see those that are appropriate and feasible for me to implement (often, around 25% are). I would then ask the model to expand on these, and perhaps to write them up in more formal language if needed (often, my initial conversations do not include requests for specific formatting or language as at that stage I'm the only intended audience).

The two outputs I then use these ideas for are implementing the actual strategies to overcome resistance, as well as including details of them in the change and stakeholder planning documents (so other people can read these to understand what we're doing).

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - it sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach. I'm curious about that 25% figure you mentioned - when you're reviewing those initial AI suggestions, what makes you decide that most of them aren't appropriate or feasible?

What are you looking for that helps you identify which ideas will actually work in your specific situation?

User: The types of factors that make certain suggestions appropriate include how costly they might be to implement, whether we have tried the solution before, personal judgement as to whether they would work with the specific people involved (this is probably the most important one) and whether the ideas fit within our organisations culture.

AI: That personal judgment piece about whether solutions would work with the specific people involved - that sounds like it draws on knowledge and intuition that's pretty unique to your situation. 

Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice? How do you evaluate whether an AI suggestion would actually work with the particular individuals on your team?

User: A recent example was when we had a team that worked across multiple office locations - a suggestion such as conducting team building exercises to build morale and overcome resistance then becomes difficult.

To go deeper, I often find it is about knowing how an individual prefers to work, their personality (i.e introverted or extroverted) and how they like to learn (listening, doing etc.) is all taken into account to decide what ideas are appropriate.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're filtering the AI's suggestions through your understanding of individual personalities and work styles. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in this change management work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Any information that is going to an audience beyond myself I would always want to have the final draft and decision on content. Aside from this, I'm not currently making many decisions to not use AI for certain things, but this is because I'm still in the process of understanding what AI is capable of.

What makes the above mentioned task different is a matter of personal and company reputation - if an external audience were to read something generic, not specific, or that didn't make sense for our company that was  generated by AI, it would not reflect well on me or my company.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - protecting your reputation and your company's reputation when content goes to external audiences. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you go back and forth quite a bit - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Definitely collaborate on a task - I will start with a request and then refine over a series of questions and providing more content for the AI model

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really interactive. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people around you using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: I would say most people are like me (use it for some basic work, but haven't yet understood or put in effort to strategise fully about how it can be applied). There are a few people though that champion the use of AI for the organisation, which is helpful. They will often ask if AI can do a task we're thinking about, and making sure our budgeting and future planning involves AI.

AI: That's interesting that you have those AI champions in your organization. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My experiences are mostly satisfied ones. There's a lot of information I need to remember in my role, and it can also become difficult to generate ideas (mental fatigue from working, trying to multi-task etc.).

When needing to write a change plan, it is often difficult to know where to start so an example of a good experience was having AI note down common sections and content for this type of plan, which I can then add specifics to.

AI: That sounds like a really practical way AI helps you get past that blank page problem. The mental fatigue piece is interesting too - it sounds like AI gives you a kind of cognitive support when you're stretched thin.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Sort of - but I don't think so much as to maintaining my skills where AI can take over but more thinking about growing my skills in areas that AI may not be able to assist with

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - focusing on growth rather than preservation. 

What kinds of skills are you thinking about developing that you feel AI might not be able to assist with? What makes those areas different in your mind?

User: Leadership (influencing people and growing teams) and stakeholder engagement are areas that I see as important for me to focus on. They're different because they rely on me - how I conduct myself and work with people.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those deeply interpersonal skills that depend on your personal presence and relationships.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you?

User: I need to make an effort to learn and understand more about what AI can do in my current role. I also see that a big part of my role will then be leading and helping people adapt to AI - my role is to lead change and I see a lot of this being driven by AI.

One other aspect I see is the need for people and organisations to build up trust for AI and what it can do before it can be widely adopted.

AI: Those are really insightful thoughts about your dual role - both learning to use AI more effectively yourself and then helping others navigate that same transition.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you filter AI suggestions through your knowledge of specific people and situations, and your focus on developing skills that complement rather than compete with AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all, but what do you think - which areas should I be focusing on or thinking about when it comes to AI in my role?

AI: I appreciate you asking, but as a researcher, I want to be careful not to influence your experience or direct you in any particular direction - that could affect the insights we're trying to gather from these conversations.

What I can say is that you've clearly already developed a thoughtful, systematic approach to using AI in your work, and your focus on the interpersonal skills that are uniquely human seems really well-aligned with your role in change management.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative workflow you've developed and how you're thinking about AI's role in organizational change will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
