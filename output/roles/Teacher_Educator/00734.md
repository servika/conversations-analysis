Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds great

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I've been encouraged to use AI to search that Stats textbook I teach out of for my job as a teachers assistant

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI to help navigate through your statistics textbook content as a teaching assistant. 

Tell me more about that. What specific things are you searching for in the textbook, and how does the AI help you with that process?

User: Generally looking for concepts that are in the homework questions that I want to find a text basis for. I teach a tutorial every week where I go over the concepts with the students so I need to deeply understand every answer and where in the text students might pull information.

AI: That gives me a good picture of your role. So you're essentially using AI to help you map homework concepts back to specific textbook sections, making sure you can guide students to the right source material.

When you're preparing for these tutorials, how do you typically interact with the AI to find these concept connections? Do you ask it to search for specific topics, or do you approach it differently?

User: I'll usually just search for specific topics or sometimes plug in the homework question and ask where I should go to find the answer

AI: Got it - so you're using it both for broad topic searches and for pinpointing where students should look for specific homework answers.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain parts of your tutorial preparation that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: When it comes to actually learning the concepts for myself I don't want AI to teach me anything. I feel like getting a summary from AI or just reading about problems without doing them myself doesn't give me as good of an understanding. I need to know all the topics very very well to be able to answer any tricky questions

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - using AI as a navigation tool for finding information, but keeping the actual learning and problem-solving to yourself.

When you use AI for your textbook searches, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it as you work through finding the right sections, or do you tend to ask it specific questions and then take that information to work independently?

User: Usually just working independently based on whatever the AI gives me. The students have access to the model I use so I generally just like to see where its pointing and then go from there on my own. I repeat this for each of the homework problems.

AI: That makes sense - you're using it for initial direction-finding, then doing your own independent work. And it's interesting that your students have access to the same model.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any guidance or discussion about how TAs should be incorporating these tools?

User: Generally we've been encouraged to use these models to find stuff in the text by our professor but haven't received much guidance beyond that. There are some guiding principals in TA handbooks about AI in relationship to academic integrity, but this is generally more about keeping students honest than what TAs should or shouldn't use AI for.

AI: So you've got some encouragement to use AI for textbook navigation, but the guidance is pretty minimal beyond academic integrity concerns for students.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think I just generally feel a bit weird about it. I'm used to looking at textbooks the old fashioned way and using AI feels like its making me lazy sometimes.

AI: That's a really honest response. Can you tell me more about that feeling of it making you lazy? What specifically about using AI gives you that sense, compared to your usual way of working with textbooks?

User: It just feels like not reading the full text and taking the time to understand the whole thing is taking the easy way out. I can ctrl-F a textbook and find the information usually just as fast, so using AI feels like I'm picking up a habit of taking the easy way out which can sometimes lead to subpar work in other situations.

AI: That's a thoughtful concern - you're worried that relying on AI shortcuts might create habits that could undermine the quality of your work in other areas.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given your role in teaching and needing that deep understanding?

User: I don't really worry about the AI taking over thing because I believe what I do is specialized. I'm a TA and also a master's student so my job is teaching and research and deep understanding of concepts. I recognize the field of AI is very helpful for some administrative things and the concept of machine learning has a ton of great applications, but I think AI is less of a "threat" than the general public believes.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing AI as helpful for certain functions while recognizing the irreplaceable value of human expertise in teaching and research.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue using it primarily for navigation tasks, or do you see that changing?

User: I think I'd like to continue to use it for navigation. Maybe if it continues to progress in quality I would think of using it for more administrative tasks, but my rule about not using it for understanding concepts will probably stand firm.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that clear boundary between using AI for navigation versus preserving your own deep learning process - that distinction seems really important for your role as both a teacher and student.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really no!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a navigation tool while maintaining your own deep learning processes will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been great talking with you!
