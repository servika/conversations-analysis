Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So my day to day role is that of a Senior Finance Manager. This means I use AI for a varying amount of tasks including; correcting or suggesting useful Excel formulas to work with financial data, asking for help or guidance on building financial models, working on business strategy documents, general leadership and senior managerial guidance.

AI: That's a really interesting range of applications. It sounds like you're using AI across both the technical and strategic sides of your role.

When you mention working on business strategy documents, can you tell me more about that? What does your interaction with AI look like when you're tackling those kinds of strategic tasks?

User: So this could be when preparing a document that pitches an internal investment for example. I may need help with the general structure or approach of the document, or even perhaps how to really influence and convince within the document, as well as the dos and don'ts .

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI as a strategic advisor for high-stakes internal communications. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: So usually if information or a task is open to wide interpretation or requires a high amount of business context - I will handle it myself. Some business /finance problems are really company specific, so without knowing all the history of the company, its internal culture, processes , policies etc, AI cannot give a meaningful answer / insight. I know that AI could probably give a generic steer or guidance, but it would not be tailored to the organisational structure to make it meaningful enough.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing the line where institutional knowledge and context become critical. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: So my approach would be to define a set of system instructions to follow, I'll give an example. I have a supplier invoice that contains line level detail of waste for disposal as well as an EWC code. I want to be able to take a screenshot of that lien form the invoice and then have AI categorise it into industry standard classifications. I would provide / define the list of categories I wanted the AI model to compare to, as well as specify the output required which would include text extraction from the image. This will save me a lot of time as I get 2 things from one request; the text from the image, and a an expert classification where I may not have the whole knowledge.

AI: That's a really clever application - you're essentially creating a specialized workflow where you set the parameters and let AI handle the execution. It sounds like you're getting both efficiency and expertise in one go.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Honestly... not very much! Most colleagues are clueless about the power of AI or even fearful that it will "get things wrong". Today our Financial Controller asked one of our accountants to show the team how he uses AI to generate an Excel formula. He said " I just ask it and it tells me", the Financial Controller didn't understand and she said "but how do you do it". I feel people are not very clued up on the basic interactions with AI right now.

AI: That disconnect you're describing is really striking - it sounds like you're operating quite independently in your AI adoption while others are still grappling with the fundamentals.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well a great moment was when AI helped me construct a financial model to help assess whether we should buy out our leased fleet. It really helped me build a strawman model which I could then flesh out with the company specific knowledge and quirks - it saved a lot of time with me scratching my head! The thing is I still needed my financial knowledge and expertise to interpret the model suggestions, so it wasn't the case that "anyone" could just do it using AI

AI: That's a perfect example of that collaboration you're describing - AI handling the structural foundation while you bring the expertise and context. It sounds like it amplified your capabilities rather than replaced them.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I have thought about, but again I bring it back to business context / knowledge. In the world of Finance we advise the business based on what is happening now and what may happen in the future. Unless an AI model had perfect knowledge of all employees at once, it will never replace the nuanced subjective decision making of finance leaders

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're positioning your value in that nuanced, contextual decision-making space that requires deep organizational understanding.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it being more connected within the day to day workflows of my work. Currently AI is not enabled and embedded within our day to day office applications such as email. I want to see it plugged into the raw data lakes and warehouses across the organisation to absorb information. Imagine an AI model that can contextualise itself within the fabric of an organisation - a personalised AI model for Company Inc....

AI: That vision of an AI that's deeply embedded in your organizational ecosystem is really compelling - essentially moving from external advisor to integrated organizational intelligence.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how business context and institutional knowledge create natural boundaries for AI delegation, and your vision of AI becoming more organizationally integrated.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to understand how someone in your position navigates the strategic use of AI while maintaining that critical human expertise layer.

Have a great rest of your day!
