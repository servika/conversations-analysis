Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good! No questions on my end.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure! I use AI in a standard workday for more mundane and technical tasks. In the Architecture field, that usually means writing emails and asking code and construction questions that are split between being collaborative and cut-and-dry. I sporadically use it to write specifications, but the verbiage in our documents is so nuanced that I usually have to do it without the help of AI. The projects I work on are all protected by NDAs, so I only use AI for more general items that don't disclose explicit project details.

AI: That's really interesting how the NDA constraints shape what you can and can't use AI for. 

When you mention that AI helps with "collaborative and cut-and-dry" code and construction questions - could you walk me through what that looks like? How do you decide which questions fall into each category?

User: A cut-and-dry question might look something like, "Does the 2018 code in Pennsylvania allow multiple egress points to share a corridor?" where a more collaborative question would be something less targeted like, "I have twenty exit doors on a building side that's approximately 200 feet in length, is there any codes that limit how many openings I can have?" AI might come back with "Yes, there is nothing within the code that limits how many openings you can have," where I would ask, "Is this common to do in most buildings or seen as abnormal?" Those are rough examples, but it showcases something that is more objective versus a conversation with more back-and-forth with the model.

AI: That's a great distinction. It sounds like the cut-and-dry questions have a specific factual answer you're looking for, while the collaborative ones involve more of a dialogue where you're exploring different angles.

When you're in those collaborative conversations - like asking whether having twenty exit doors is common practice - what draws you to continue that back-and-forth with AI rather than just looking it up elsewhere or asking a colleague?

User: Exactly, cut-and-dry is typically more objective and collaboration conversations involve more subjectivity and maybe loose design elements. I like to run items by AI to make sure I am not immediately running into a dead end, so when I do talk to my colleagues, I have at least some idea as to whether what I propose is doable. I work on projects in many locations that incorporate various codes, so it can get complicated to navigate to the correct IBC year in addition to the codes enforced by the various jurisdictions.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a kind of initial sounding board before bringing ideas to your colleagues. It sounds like the complexity of different jurisdictions and code years makes AI particularly useful for that preliminary check.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, there are a few tasks in my day-to-day where I don't feel the need to use AI. These are mostly design-related items, which 1. I do not share on any external sources to comply with my NDA and 2. I genuinely enjoy designing and feel like it's so nuanced and subjective. The design process also involves a lot of collaboration with my peers, and I would say when I am in a room with my coworkers I seldom think to use AI

AI: That's fascinating - the design work seems to sit at the intersection of what you enjoy doing and what requires that human collaboration and nuanced judgment. 

You mentioned that when you're in a room with coworkers, you seldom think to use AI. Tell me more about that - what is it about being physically present with colleagues that changes how you think about using AI tools?

User: When I'm in a room with coworkers, there's such a plethora of experience and knowledge between individuals where there always seems to be someone who has an answer or can at least point the team in the correct direction. There are also so many voices, opinions, and personalities when in a room with other people where I am trying to keep up with the conversation (and sub-conversations) where I don't have the time to think about and type out what I want to ask AI. That being said, there are times when I leave an in-person collaboration session and look back at my notes and consult with AI about items/questions I have that came out of the meeting. These are usually the cut-and-dry questions I mentioned earlier, and I am usually seeking an answer to a question that came up but wasn't important/relevant to the main conversation

AI: That's a really vivid picture - the dynamic energy and multiple conversations happening at once making it hard to step away and formulate questions for AI. And it's interesting how AI becomes useful afterward for those lingering questions that weren't central to the main discussion.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would say it's 50/50. If I am working on a design item, I might ask questions throughout the duration in which I'm designing. Sometimes questions that are still related to work but unrelated to what I am working on come up in my head, so I will pop those into AI while they're still fresh in my mind. I delegate more mundane tasks like email writing or cut-and-dry questions for AI to handle independently, as there isn't much use for back-and-forth conversation.

AI: That split makes a lot of sense - using AI as a thinking partner during design work while delegating the more straightforward tasks completely.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped how openly you use it or the types of tasks you feel comfortable using it for?

User: I have many coworkers who use AI; I think it makes it feel more normalized. I would say my older peers actually use it more than anyone else. I've seen it used in similar ways to which I use it, but I've also seen it used to produce generic images for a PowerPoint presentation or to process numbers from an Excel document and give an evaluation. I wouldn't say it has currently shaped the way in which I used it, but I do enjoy seeing how other people get creative with what it can do. It certainly opens my eyes to potential ways I can use AI in the future

AI: It's interesting that your older colleagues are the heaviest users - that goes against what many people might expect! And I love how you're picking up new ideas from watching others, like using AI for image generation and Excel analysis.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I wouldn't say I have ever been frustrated using AI at work, but I was really happy with how it worked when I was in a conversation with my coworker. We were talking about some code-related item on a building we were designing (I can't remember the exact code question we had, but it had to deal with occupancies). Since we were both unsure, I typed the question into AI and requested where the information lived in the IBC, and it told me exactly what I wanted to know and where to go in the IBC to confirm what it said. It saved both me and my coworker a lot of time!

AI: That sounds like such a perfect use case - getting both the answer and the exact code reference so you could verify it yourself. It's great that it worked so smoothly in real-time with your colleague there.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I consider. Since there is so much subjectivity and nuance in Architecture and construction, I think the ways in which AI could takeover are limited. Even in the ways I use it, I see it as a tool to enhance my work rather than replacing the work I already do. I don't see AI submitting our construction drawings or doing site walks anytime soon. I think there could be improvements made with the design aspect, but it's hard to prefer AI over people with 30+ years in the industry who know all the ins and outs.

AI: That perspective makes a lot of sense - viewing AI as enhancement rather than replacement, especially given how much tacit knowledge and on-site experience matters in your field.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I would really love to use AI in the future with more standard design items, like common, standard details or writing specifications for a section that has changed from what we initially had. In other words, I see my relationship with AI expanding, not shrinking or staying the same.

AI: That's a great outlook - expanding into more standardized design elements while keeping the complex, nuanced work for yourself and your experienced colleagues.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the collaborative, in-person dynamic changes your AI usage patterns, and how you see AI as an enhancement tool rather than replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a preliminary sounding board, the influence of NDAs on usage patterns, and how workplace dynamics shape AI interaction will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
