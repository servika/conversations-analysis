Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds great thank you

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: we primarily use AI to transcribe client sessions into SOAP notes

AI: That's really interesting - so you're working in a healthcare or therapeutic setting. 

Tell me more about that process. How does the AI transcription work, and what happens after it creates those SOAP notes?

User: We do canine rehabilitation therapy, so our clients are the dogs. They can't talk. We wear microphones and describe each step of what we are doing, and the AI helps measure time duration and repetitions. It then writes them in our notes in an easy way to read and review

AI: That's fascinating - I hadn't considered how AI could help with non-verbal patients like that. So you're essentially narrating the therapy session as it happens, and the AI is both tracking the quantitative aspects like timing and reps, plus organizing it all into readable documentation.

When you're wearing those microphones during sessions, how does that feel? Does narrating out loud change how you work with the dogs at all?

User: it doesn't really change, I can say "come on fido, let's climb up on to this ball! Good, hold it there for a few moments... excellent good job. Let's do it again" and the AI will transcribe it to something like "Fido was able to climb on the ball and remain there for 7 seconds. Exercise was repeated 3 times"

AI: That's a really smooth translation from your natural interaction with the dogs to clinical documentation. It sounds like the AI is doing quite a bit of interpretation - taking your conversational encouragement and translating it into measurable, professional language.

Are there certain types of exercises or situations where the AI struggles more with that translation, or does it generally capture what you need it to?

User: The AI was designed for human healthcare, so the niche market of canine rehab does have some struggles. For example, if we are talking about Range of Motion, the AI thinks if we say 180° then it must be a mistake, because a human patient wouldn't have that great of a range of motion. We have to correct that manually when we are reviewing our notes after a session

AI: Ah, that makes perfect sense - dogs have very different anatomical capabilities than humans. So you're adapting a human healthcare AI for veterinary use, which creates these interesting mismatches.

When you're doing that manual review and correction afterward, how much time does that typically add to your workflow? Is it still faster than writing the notes from scratch, even with those corrections?

User: it's still much faster. Typically a session is 40 minutes, and it can be difficult to remember every step that was taken and how long each repetition lasts. Notes would take upwards of 40 minutes to complete after a session. With using AI, even with reviewing and changing some details that were misinterpreted, notes now take about 5-10 minutes.

AI: That's a huge time savings - going from 40 minutes down to 5-10 minutes is remarkable. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there parts of the note-taking or documentation process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though the AI could potentially help with those areas too?

User: I haven't yet found something where the AI could do it but I choose to do it manually. Most of our manual work is because we don't have the right tool to help us right now

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - it sounds like you're quite open to AI assistance wherever it can be effective. 

When you say you don't have the right tool, are you thinking about improvements to the current transcription system, or are there completely different aspects of your work where you wish you had AI tools that don't exist yet?

User: Our whole booking process is quite manual and we're using 3 different software options to help us achieve this right now. We are looking into other options for a more inclusive option. Right now our bookings are in one software, the CMS is another, and the AI for our notes is a third. Having one integrated program would save a lot of the duplicate work of saving the notes to the appointment as well as the client file

AI: That fragmentation across three different systems sounds like it creates a lot of extra steps and potential for things to fall through the cracks.

When you're moving information between those three systems - from bookings to CMS to the AI notes tool - how does that affect your typical interaction with each one? Are you more collaborative with the AI throughout that process, or do you tend to complete tasks in one system before moving to the next?

User: we each do it a little differently. I try to do it all at one time, if I have different browser tabs open it is not that big of a job to copy/paste notes into the different systems. It gets cumbersome when I don't have a computer and have to do this on my phone

AI: So it sounds like there's some variation in how your team approaches this workflow. The device you're using - computer versus phone - really impacts how manageable that multi-system process feels.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you all approach the AI transcription tool similarly, or have different styles emerged?

User: We are a very small clinic and only half of us really like the AI and see its benefit. Others do not use it to it's potential. For example, one person does not describe what they are doing during the session, and instead uses the AI to talk about the session after the fact and the AI will then write that into the appropriate notes. It takes them a lot longer, because they need to describe the session and rely on their memory, and then review. Those of us who are on board with the AI and know how to use it have tried to teach them how much more efficient they could be, but they either don't understand or are reluctant to change.

AI: That divide in your small clinic sounds like it creates some interesting dynamics. You've got people who've really embraced the real-time narration approach versus those who are essentially using it as a dictation tool after the fact.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I am developing a new template to use for the structure of a session, it is frustrating to describe to the AI the type of information I want them to listen for and how to transcribe it into the notes. I wish there was an easier way to make these templates so future notes are easier. Right now it is a trial and error approach that can take a lot of time, until the template is achieved. Then it is fast

AI: That template creation process sounds like it requires a lot of upfront investment before you see the payoff. The trial and error aspect must be particularly challenging when you're trying to communicate the nuances of what information matters most for different types of sessions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your work?

User: AI will not be able to replace the work that I do, working with dogs, but it can streamline the admin side of the business incredibly. The more time I have to help clients and not do the paperwork, the better for everyone

AI: That's a really clear distinction - the hands-on therapeutic work with the dogs is uniquely yours, but the administrative burden is where AI can free up your time for what matters most.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Are there particular areas where you're hoping to see improvements or new capabilities?

User: We have an AI phone system that will summarize our phone messages for us, but that system will not let us customize commonly misheard words (like our business name). The program we use for notes does allow that customization. I hope that going forward more products allow for that type of customization to make the products more useful, especially for our purposes where we aren't using the same lingo as a typical healthcare worker. It would be nice for the system to be able to auto-send reports after the session to the client's owner, their vet, as well as save in our system, but right now that is all done manually as we're working with multiple software products

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as an admin streamliner rather than a replacement for the core therapeutic work, and the practical challenges of adapting human healthcare AI for canine rehabilitation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in such a specialized field - from the real-time transcription challenges to the team adoption differences to the need for veterinary-specific customization - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how this technology is working in practice at your clinic. Take care!
