Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostlyuse AI for quick research and for helping with excel formulas etc

AI: That's helpful to know. Can you walk me through what that quick research looks like for you? What kinds of things are you typically researching?

User: I work in tax so normally look at tax legislation or guidance

AI: Got it. When you're looking at tax legislation or guidance, how does AI help you with that research? What does that process typically look like?

User: I use it to quickly research new topics, for example looking at the correct treatment of a certain benefit in kind and identifying the relevant legislation

AI: That sounds really useful for getting oriented on new topics. When you use AI to identify relevant legislation for something like benefit in kind treatment, what happens next? Do you take that information and work with it independently, or does your interaction with AI continue as you work through the issue?

User: I would normal double check the information provided and then work with it independently

AI: That makes sense - verifying the information first. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your tax work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Some tasks like reviewing bank statements AI would be helpful with, however, I do this myself as it includes large datasets where double checking the AIs work would result in me doing the work anyway, meaning there would be no time saved

AI: That's a really insightful point about the double-checking overhead. It sounds like you've thought carefully about where the time investment makes sense. 

When you do use AI - like for that legislation research - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach using AI in your work?

User: I work in government so have to be extremely careful with customer data when using AI, as mentioned I also double check the work of AI as not doing so could lead to reputational damage.

AI: That context about working in government really helps me understand the stakes involved. The need to protect customer data and avoid reputational damage definitely adds layers of consideration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI has proved really useful when working with excel, using it to convert data into usable insights without being a formula whizz!

AI: That sounds like it's been a real game-changer for your Excel work. When you say it converts data into usable insights, can you tell me more about what that looks like? What kind of insights are you typically trying to get from your data?

User: For example, using AI to create fairly complicated "if" formulas to take lists of employees with access to vehicles over a number of years, breaking it down into per year figures automatically without filtering or manually breaking the information donw

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like AI is helping you automate some really time-consuming data manipulation tasks. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially with tasks like Excel formulas where AI is proving so helpful?

User: I don't see a real need to worry too much about maintaining skills like Excel when AI can already do it better than I. I do consider whether other areas of my work may become redundant, but I feel that the difference between AI and myself in my work would be an investigative "gut instinct" which would be harder to train into AI.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - this idea of "investigative gut instinct" as something distinctly human. Can you tell me more about what that looks like in your tax work? When does that gut instinct kick in for you?

User: I would say when I notice small indicators of potentially unusual activity that prompt me to look at other avenues, that sometimes result in nothing, but other times pay off. I think AI may decide in that case to stay on track, which makes sense in terms of probabilities, but sometimes going off track produces a better reslult

AI: That's really insightful - the value of pursuing those low-probability hunches that might not make statistical sense but can lead to important discoveries. It sounds like you see that intuitive leap as something uniquely human.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from how you use it now?

User: As AI improves, I can see myself relying on it more and trusting it more, requiring less double-checking

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that "investigative gut instinct" and how you've thought through where AI adds value versus where human judgment remains essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI efficiency with the need for verification in government work, and especially your thoughts on that investigative intuition, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
