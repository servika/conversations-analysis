Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI everyday in small capacities. Mostly editing my writing

AI: Tell me more about that editing process. What does that look like when you're working with AI to edit your writing?

User: I submit either an entire pdf of my work, or copy and paste paragraphs or sentences over into the ai model. I ask it to edit it to include more or less of something, to change words, to possess a certain tone, or rewrite completely.

AI: That's helpful context. When you're making those different types of requests - whether it's tweaking tone or doing a complete rewrite - how do you typically work through that process? Do you go back and forth with the AI, or do you tend to give it instructions and let it handle the task completely?

User: I go back and forth. I'll make subtle tweaks (such as change out this word), or rewrite just one small part of the work, or add in more of something until I happy with the result

AI: That back-and-forth approach sounds quite collaborative. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I write very technical product-specific papers. So, AI is mostly used for just basic editing/rewriting (things like tone, word choice, or summarizing). I don't like using AI to generate new content on it's own because it doesn't have a good enough understanding of the very nuanced product.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction you're making - using AI for the editing layer but keeping the content generation to yourself because of those product nuances. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Our company adopted it's own AI model about a year ago. Since then, there's been growing pressure across departments to use it. This past week leadership submitted a formal request across the company for staff to start submitting examples of how they're using AI in their work. Prior to this, it's been fairly relaxed as to who uses AI and for what. Now it seems like the workplace culture is really beginning to push for it.

AI: That sounds like quite a shift in the workplace dynamic around AI use. How has that growing pressure and the formal request from leadership affected your own approach to using AI? Has it changed how you think about or use these tools in your work?

User: Yes, it's made me think how I can begin to use AI even more outside of my most common use: rewriting/editing. I've begun to dip my toes into using AI for data analysis as that's another important part of my role. Outside of that though, I'm still in an area of ideation as to how AI can enhance other functions. I'd like to also use it to help automate more rote tasks that I do day to day.

AI: It sounds like you're exploring new territory with the data analysis. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI made me feel frustrated when I was trying to get it to interpret submitted presentations. I uploaded a pdf of a slideshow and it was only able to interpret some of the text. It was not able to interpret any of the visual elements which is a substantial piece of a presentation.

AI: That limitation with visual elements sounds like it created a real gap in what you needed. On the flip side, has there been a time when using AI left you feeling particularly satisfied with the outcome?

User: Yeah, AI does a great job summarizing and categorizing. I'll submit survey feedback from a presentation I've led, and AI does a fantastic job categorizing and summarizing participant feedback into something I can take actionable next steps with.

AI: That's a powerful use case - turning raw feedback into actionable insights. As you're exploring these different applications and with the workplace push to use AI more, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yeah it's definitely something I consider. Most of my work consists of live presentations and interactions with customers. I continue to refine my presentation skills. I don't think AI is at a point yet where it could seamlessly facilitate and interact with customers about the highly-technical products I work with; however, I definitely use AI to support me in my work.

AI: That makes sense - keeping those core presentation and customer interaction skills sharp while leveraging AI as support. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision my relationship with AI continuing to grow. It's fairly minimal and simple now - I use the same prompts and complete the same tasks day to day with AI. However, I'd like to integrate it more into other, more complex tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that boundary between AI-supported editing and your own content generation because of the technical nuance involved.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No - that's all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how workplace culture is shifting around AI adoption, the collaborative editing process you've developed, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining core skills while exploring new AI applications will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
