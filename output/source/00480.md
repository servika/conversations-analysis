Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use it for drafting emails or proofreading/editing emails.  I have used it for suggestions for working with kids on the autism spectrum, like ways of teaching language.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI for both communication tasks and for specialized educational support. 

Tell me more about how you use it for working with kids on the autism spectrum. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: I would ask it something like, "Give me a way to incorporate the 4 W's into a lesson on sentences".

AI: So you're asking it for specific teaching strategies and lesson ideas. When you get those suggestions back - like ways to incorporate the 4 W's - what do you typically do with them? Do you use them as-is, or do you modify them for your particular students?

User: I generally modify them for the specific student, since they all have different abilities.

AI: That makes sense - you're using it as a starting point and then customizing based on each student's needs. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Sometimes I like to create my own lesson instead of ask AI, like the language/sentence writing one we just talked about.  It's not so much the specific task but how high or low energy I'm feeling on a particular day.

AI: That's a really honest insight - so your energy level on any given day influences whether you reach for AI or tackle something yourself. 

Can you tell me more about what it feels like on those high-energy days when you prefer to create lessons yourself versus the lower-energy days when AI feels more appealing?

User: Some days there could be a lot going on in the classroom with behavior like aggression or meltdowns.  Those times I am more mentally and emotionally drained and ready for a break.  On days when behaviors are low, I tend to have more energy to put into tasks myself.

AI: That really paints a clear picture - the classroom environment and what you're managing with student behaviors directly impacts how you engage with AI as a tool. It sounds like AI becomes almost like a support system on those more challenging days.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to give it tasks to complete independently, but modify its response to suit the student.

AI: So you're delegating the initial creation but then stepping back in to customize - that's an interesting workflow. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about it with other teachers, or is it something you've figured out on your own?

User: I'm probably the only instructional assistant (teacher assistant) that uses it.  The teachers use it for similar purposes like drafting emails but also for lesson planning.  I don't really talk to anyone else about it.

AI: So you've kind of discovered and developed your own approach to using it. It sounds like the teachers around you are using it too, but for somewhat broader purposes like lesson planning.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't think of a time it made me feel frustrated.  Anything I've asked it to do, it's done well enough that I could use it or adapt it slightly.  In general I feel satisfied with it, I can't think of one instance where I felt specifically very satisfied.

AI: That's actually quite telling - it sounds like AI has been consistently reliable for you, meeting your expectations without major highs or lows. It's working as a steady, dependable tool.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I've thought about it a bit, but there will always be a need for a role like mine.  Computer AI can't accompany a student to a specials class or modify their behavior - that has to come from a human.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - you're recognizing the irreplaceable human elements of your role. The physical presence, the behavioral support, the real-time adaptations you make with students.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'd like to see other teacher aides/assistants use it, but I don't think that will happen without a training on how it can benefit someone in that role.

AI: That's an interesting observation - you see the potential for it to help others in similar roles, but you recognize there's a knowledge gap about how to apply it effectively as an instructional assistant.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your energy levels and the classroom environment influence when you turn to AI for support - that's such a practical, human way of thinking about these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think what's interesting is that teachers are using AI but in general students are expected not to - I'm focusing more on general education students, not special education students.  I can see some conflict rearing its head over that in the coming years so that is something administrators will have to figure out how to navigate.

AI: That's a really astute observation about the potential tension between educator use and student restrictions. You're seeing a dynamic that could create some challenging conversations ahead - adults using these tools as part of their professional practice while simultaneously telling students they can't use them for their learning.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into the daily realities of working with students, especially around energy management and the irreplaceable human elements of your role, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
