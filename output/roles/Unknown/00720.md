Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for creative advertising ideas, writing emails, coming up with names for events, and data analysis for said events. I tend to use AI when I get stuck and I need help working out an activity idea or need some routine, tedious task done.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of creative and analytical work. You mentioned using AI when you get stuck or for routine tasks - can you tell me more about what "getting stuck" looks like for you? What's happening in those moments when you decide to turn to AI?

User: If I have an idea that I can't fully work out (i.e. how a learning objective can tie into a fun activity idea seamlessly), then I turn to AI to help me come up with ways to tweak the activity to make sure the learning and the fun go hand-in-hand.

AI: That's a fascinating way to use AI - as a creative partner when you're bridging that gap between learning and engagement. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you do delegate?

User: I prefer to write internal team communications myself because it's really important to me that I sound like me even if my message can be written more professionally by AI. If there are routine tasks like advertising emails or analyzing who has been to our events or if I get creatively stuck (and it's too menial of a task to reach out to my team) at any point, then that's the kind of thing I like to give to AI.

AI: That distinction between sounding like yourself versus having something polished is really insightful. It sounds like authenticity in your team communications is something you value highly.

When you do use AI for those tasks - like the advertising emails or event analysis or creative problem-solving - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it the task and let it handle it independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process to nail down exactly what it is I want

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really hands-on. You're working together to refine and shape the output rather than just handing off a task completely.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the environment around you shaped how you approach these tools?

User: It is really important in my workplace to encourage diversity and be mindfully sensitive to cultural differences. So I usually make sure to have AI help me look out for things that could come off as offensive and I try to include in my prompts to AI that we have a very diverse culture

AI: That's a thoughtful way to leverage AI - using it as a lens to help ensure inclusivity and cultural sensitivity. It sounds like your workplace values have really shaped how you prompt and interact with these tools.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI tends to make me feel frustrated when I am trying to come up with event names. It doesn't seem to grasp the nuance that I am looking for (i.e. puns, anagrams, etc.)

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like there's a specific creative nuance you're looking for with wordplay that AI struggles to capture. When you're working on those event names and feeling that frustration, what do you find yourself doing? Do you keep trying different approaches with AI, or do you shift to handling it yourself?

User: After a few prompts and responses, if I haven't gotten anything I am satisfied with, I usually take the issue to my team to help figure out. I have a very creative team.

AI: That's a great example of knowing when to pivot from AI to human collaboration. It sounds like you have a clear sense of when AI has reached its limits for a particular task.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: The human connection is too important in my job for AI to take over entirely. It's not something I consider often.

AI: That confidence in the irreplaceable human element of your work is really striking. You seem to have a clear sense of where that boundary lies.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from how you use it now?

User: I hope to use AI to create full flyer advertisements in the future. I would like to be able to give it a set of system prompts that all event flyers need to follow and then specify what I want out of each individual ad to help me cut down on designing time. Other than that, I don't see too much evolving from what I do with AI now.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've defined the boundaries - using AI as a collaborative tool while preserving your authentic voice in team communications, and recognizing when human creativity and connection are irreplaceable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: We do a bit of AI training in our department and the main focus of this training is to make clear that we are fully allowed to use AI, but it is harped on that we must fully review whatever the AI comes up with. This is due to how important accurate data and supporting a safe environment for all is in my job.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the emphasis on human oversight and verification, especially given the stakes around accuracy and safety in your work environment. It sounds like your organization has been quite intentional about establishing those guardrails while still encouraging AI use.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between AI assistance and human judgment, particularly in creative and culturally sensitive work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about describing your process and boundaries.
