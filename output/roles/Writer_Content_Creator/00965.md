Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As of right now, not very often. Occasionally, I will ask for certain lesson plans or ideas to expand upon a lesson plan to make it more creative and engaging.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're in education. When you do use AI for those lesson plans, what specifically are you looking to get from it? Are you starting from scratch or building on ideas you already have?

User: Building on ideas I already have. Typically, ways to incorporate different styles of learning, mainly with more engaging ways to cement concepts into a child's mind. More originality, I guess, than my own creativity or what you'd find online by searching.

AI: That makes sense - you're looking for that fresh perspective beyond what's already out there. When you say you don't use AI very often right now, what holds you back from using it more frequently? Is it a matter of not seeing other opportunities, or are there other factors at play?

User: Probably not seeing other opportunities. I homeschool so I'm not under anyone's authority of when I can and cannot use AI.

AI: That's a great point - the homeschooling environment gives you complete flexibility. So it sounds like it's more about discovering where AI might be helpful rather than any restrictions. 

Are there teaching tasks you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even knowing AI could potentially help? What makes those feel important for you to do personally?

User: Yes, there are definitely things I would rather do myself. For example, I would rather gather and piece together certain books for the year myself that I feel will add to the lessons I am trying to convey, especially for subjects such as history, geography, etc. Doing that part is important to me because I have a large library of amazing books that are just waiting to be used and integrating them in a meaningful way brings me satisfaction and a sense of accomplishment. If I ask AI for book recommendations about certain subjects, it will give me many I do not have. Actually, thinking about this makes me realize I do need to get my library in order and digitized so I can give the book list to AI and it can give me all the books that fit into subject criteria I give it. That would actually be amazing.

AI: That's such a vivid example - I can really hear the satisfaction you get from that curation process with your own collection. It sounds like there's something meaningful about knowing your books intimately and making those personal connections.

And what an interesting realization about digitizing your library! That would essentially let you keep the part you love - the meaningful integration - while getting AI's help with the organizational piece.

When you do work with AI on lesson planning, how does that interaction typically unfold? Do you tend to go back and forth with it, refining ideas together, or do you more often give it your concept and let it run with it?

User: Back and forth and refining together.

AI: Tell me more about that back-and-forth process. What does that collaboration look like in practice?

User: So let's say I ask for engaging science experiments that can help demonstrate the law of motion. AI may give me several ideas but maybe they are not something that I can practically do with just one or two of us or I want something with a little more umph! Or maybe it is last minute and I do not have the items needed on hand.

AI: That gives me a really clear picture - so you're working through the practical realities together, like "this sounds great but I need something I can pull off right now with what's in my house." 

When you're in that back-and-forth mode and AI finally helps you land on something that works, how does that feel? What's that experience like for you?

User: It's satisfying and really helpful. It's a problem solver.

AI: That's great to hear. Now, thinking about your homeschooling community or other parents you connect with - how do their attitudes toward AI influence how you use it, if at all?

User: I think that there are a lot of them who use it way more than I do and that makes me realize maybe I am putting too much on myself instead of using a tool that could really make things easier for me. It could potentially be a game changer if I sit down and think of all the ways it could help me during the day.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - it sounds like seeing others use it more has you reconsidering what you might be missing out on. 

How do you think about maintaining your own teaching skills and instincts in areas where AI could potentially take over more of the work? Is that something you actively consider?

User: Definitely. I would never give the benefit to anything AI suggests over my own instincts. I have actually read about homeschoolers who let AI do everything, even teach their children. That is not something I would be comfortable with in any way.

AI: That's a clear boundary for you - trusting your own judgment as the primary guide. It sounds like you see AI as a tool to enhance what you're already doing rather than replace your role as the teacher.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI evolving in your homeschooling? Where do you think you might experiment or expand how you use it?

User: Well, like I said, I think I need to consider using it in more facets of my day and taking some of the workload off of me. Instead of trying to come up with unique field trips/experiments/experiences that are related to what we are studying, I need to hand that type of stuff over and see how it can make our learning better. And as mentioned before, getting my library digitized and handing it over to AI, asking it to give me all books related to "such and such" would be life changing for me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in homeschooling. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between using AI as a helpful tool while keeping your own instincts and judgment central to your teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your homeschooling that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI as a practical problem-solver while maintaining your role as the primary educator will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in educational contexts.

I really enjoyed hearing about your thoughtful approach to this - from your satisfaction with curating your own book collection to recognizing new opportunities like digitizing your library. It's clear you have a very intentional way of thinking about where AI fits into your teaching.

Thanks again for participating in this interview!
