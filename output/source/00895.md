Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds perfect - am I required to disclose any sensitive information about my job in particular?

AI: Not at all! You can share as much or as little detail about your specific job as you're comfortable with. We're more interested in understanding your general experiences and thought processes when working with AI, rather than any sensitive details about your workplace or specific projects.

Feel free to speak in general terms about your role or industry if that feels more appropriate. The goal is really to understand your personal experience with AI tools - how you use them, what works well for you, and how they fit into your workflow - rather than getting into any confidential work details.

Does that help put you at ease? Ready to dive in?

User: Understood - feel free to proceed

AI: Great! Let's start with the basics then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm typically using it for organisation. For example, if I have 5 different tasks which have some overlap I'll often prompt different AIs to help me find those overlaps more efficiently. This lets me tackle routine parts of multiple projects at the same time. If I'm working on Project X and Project Y, and both of them require some sort of research into industry Z, I'll ask the AI to find those overlaps.

AI: That's a really interesting approach - using AI as almost a project management lens to spot those connections. 

Tell me more about what that process looks like for you. When you're identifying these overlaps, are you feeding the AI detailed project descriptions, or do you work with it in some other way to surface those connections?

User: I'll typically have detailed project descriptions, yes. I'll have my written list of tasks I need to complete (Look into A, pull data on B) etc. for each project. I'll feed the project list and the list of tasks into it to help sort and categorise, prioritising based on deadline etc.

AI: That sounds like a very systematic approach. So you're essentially using AI as a strategic organizer that can see patterns across your workload that might not be immediately obvious to you.

When you get that sorted and categorized output back from the AI, how do you typically work with those recommendations? Do you tend to follow them pretty closely, or do you find yourself adjusting the AI's suggestions based on other factors it might not know about?

User: I do often find myself having to double-check everything put back to me. Oftentimes I find that the models will miss something or forget about previously mentioned tasks and reprioritise as if they've been completed.

AI: That's really insightful - so it sounds like there's this ongoing back-and-forth where you're essentially fact-checking the AI's work against your own knowledge of what's actually been done.

When you catch those kinds of errors - like the AI treating tasks as completed when they're not - how does that affect your workflow? Do you find yourself spending a lot of time correcting those mistakes, or have you developed strategies to work around that tendency?

User: I do find myself spending a lot of time correcting them - and in an effort to avoid the same ones being repeated I'll build resilience to them into the prompts I feed it.

AI: That's a really practical adaptation - essentially training the AI through your prompting to avoid the patterns of mistakes you've identified.

Can you give me an example of what one of those resilience strategies looks like? How do you structure your prompts differently to prevent those repeated errors?

User: Sure, lets say that prompt 1 resulted in an error which forgot about the deadline order or assumes that a previously mentioned task has already been completed, I would build in "Do not assume any previous tasks have yet been completed unless explicitly mentioned" which seems to help.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially creating guardrails in your prompts based on the AI's past mistakes. It sounds like you've developed quite a refined system for working with these tools.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in this organizational process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Definitely. Ultimately deadlines can change rapidly and priorities shift - when I'm up against it I'll often have to completely deviate from the suggested structure and just get on with it, especially when I don't have time to sit and re-engage with the AI to explain all of the necessary changes. I think the AI is more useful for me in my downtime to "get ahead" for the rest of the busy parts, rather than engaging when I'm actually busy.

AI: That's a really telling distinction - using AI as more of a preparation tool when you have bandwidth, rather than an in-the-moment assistant when things get hectic.

When you're in those high-pressure situations and have to deviate from the AI's structure, do you find that having gone through that initial AI-assisted planning process still provides some value, or does the rapid change essentially make that earlier work irrelevant?

User: It occasionally still provides value as it lets me track what else I have running. It's very easy for me to take a suggested order and pull one thing out, then go back to the list. On rare occasions the work can be made irrelevant, but only when a monumental change occurs (The third project in the list now becomes an immediate priority, and the overlap with later projects has to be ignored) etc.

AI: That makes perfect sense - so even when the sequence changes, the AI-generated overview still serves as a useful reference point or checklist that you can navigate flexibly.

When you use AI for this organizational work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the planning process, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it work through the complete analysis independently?

User: I try to give it as much as possible up-front. The reason why I do this is because I find that the longer the chats go on the more likely the AI is to make mistake. I prefer bulk prompt engineering followed by short refinement messages.

AI: That's a really smart observation about how AI performance can degrade over longer conversations. It sounds like you've developed quite a strategic approach to prompt engineering.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using similar approaches, or are you more of an early adopter in your environment?

User: I feel like I'm a very early adopter and power-user. I find myself making prompts for others for their routine tasks as they're not as efficient at building in guardrails.

AI: That's fascinating - so you've almost become the go-to person for AI implementation in your workplace. 

When you're creating prompts for your colleagues, what do you notice about the difference between how they naturally approach AI versus your more structured method? What kinds of mistakes do they tend to make that you're helping them avoid?

User: They'll frequently provide surface level prompts such as "organise my diary this week" without giving any further context.

AI: Ah, so they're essentially expecting the AI to read their minds about priorities, constraints, and context that only they would know.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had an intern from the United States who was proofreading an important document, and in the process had changed everything from UK to US spelling and grammar. I had to use the AI at last minute to go through and find every instance so I could quickly switch those errors. It was very satisfying.

AI: That's a great example of AI coming to the rescue in a time crunch! It sounds like the AI was able to catch those systematic changes that would have been tedious to hunt down manually.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's a huge concern in my industry, actually. Whilst the human element is still extremely important, many high-level parts are being phased out, so the junior employees are becoming less necessary.

AI: That sounds like a really significant shift in your industry. When you say the junior employees are becoming less necessary, are you seeing that impact your own role or career trajectory in any way?

How are you personally navigating that tension between leveraging AI to be more efficient while also maintaining skills that keep you valuable?

User: Massively impactful. There used to be a lot of power in being a generalist who could pivot to everything, but now the necessity is for experts. A lot of the "general" parts can easily be handled by an AI. I'm essentially trying to make myself an expert at interacting with the AI itself, so that when businesses are deploying their own models for particular reasons they have someone who can diagnose and fix any issues in a way.

AI: That's a really strategic pivot - positioning yourself as the AI specialist rather than competing with it. It sounds like you're anticipating that organizations will need people who understand how to troubleshoot and optimize these systems when they implement their own AI tools.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself moving even further in that direction of being the AI expert, or are there other ways you think your work might change?

User: I think I'll always engage with AI for non-creative tasks. Actually I'm looking to set up my own business, and I think the usage of AI will really influence how I go about it.

AI: That's exciting that you're looking to start your own business! It sounds like AI will be built into your approach from the ground up.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI performance can degrade in longer conversations and your strategic approach to becoming an AI interaction expert.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about becoming a power-user, helping colleagues with prompt engineering, and strategically positioning yourself as an AI specialist will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with your business venture - it sounds like you're really well-positioned to leverage AI effectively from the start!
