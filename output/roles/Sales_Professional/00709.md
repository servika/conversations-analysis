Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't have what you would call a typical workday as an Etsy shop owner. I've used AI for that job to ask for their advice about a customer I felt was being unreasonable, so I wanted their opinion after explaining the scenario. I also used them to help draft a professional email to that customer, as I can be a little too blunt, maybe. They gave me feedback on what I wrote, and edited it to make it work better for the situation. The customer was in the wrong, so it was nice to have AI to write something and I felt better about what it said, knowing it was coming from someone (thing) not really involved, so I had confidence in it being appropriate and fair. I used AI another time when a customer said she ordered the wrong size on accident, but she was contacting me nearly two months later about it, wanting to see if she could exchange for a smaller size set of posters. This was a frustrating scenario for me because I do not typically accept returns, this was far outside of a typical 30 return window, and the original posters she ordered were a large size, meaning they cost a lot to print, and I would have to basically sit on that cost if I took them back until someone else ordered the same posters in that size. I used AI to share these details and help me with how I could handle the situation. I ultimately came up with an idea to allow her to exchange for a smaller size, but basically get charged a "restocking fee" to cover the printing costs of the originals. I got feedback from AI on if this was fair, and help with writing the message to the customer. She seemed happy about the option, so it all worked out. You never know how reasonable a customer will be. Those are just a couple examples, but if I use AI with my Etsy job, it's typically for getting advice on a situation with a customer, or help with writing something to them. I've used AI very little on the design side of things, but only when I was brainstorming an idea and wanted to see a quick example of what it might look like.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found AI helpful for navigating those tricky customer service situations. It sounds like having that neutral perspective was valuable when emotions were running high.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you've used it very little on the design side - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: At this point, I don't really add new items to sell very often. What I sell are designs that have been there for a while. I wouldn't use AI to actually design something, because I feel things like that need to come from the artist/designer who is selling the item. I may use it in the future if I think of adding something new, and it's a concept I'd like to see a quick "sketch" of, but I wouldn't copy what AI created. I would only use it for specific ideas, not broad ones where they come up with most of the concept. For example, I had an idea and I asked it to create an image of a Samurai warrior, but holding a golf club instead of their sword. The idea was to make something stylized like a piece of Japanese art where there are different scenes of warriors or people, so I wanted to see how they would look with the golf club, as this was going to be something fun. So, in other words, I am fine with using AI as a tool simply to see something quick, but not leave it up to the AI to come up with the idea. The fact I would be selling the items, it wouldn't feel right if it's not coming from my brain and my creativity, you know?

AI: That makes complete sense - maintaining that creative authenticity in what you're selling seems really important to you. Using AI as a quick visualization tool for your own concepts versus letting it generate the creative ideas feels like a meaningful distinction.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Tho only "tasks" I really have for it are dealing with customers, which at this point, is something AI cannot do on its own. So, if there's a scenario with a customer where I need advice or help with writing something professional, I'll use the AI for feedback and help with writing. Even if it was a scenario where I just lay out the basic details of the situation and say "write a response to this customer that accomplishes my goal but is professional", I'll still have to take what they wrote and send it to the customer myself. As of now, there is no AI integrated where I could have them handle anything fully on their own.

AI: That's a good point about the current limitations - you're still the one who has to actually send the message and manage the customer relationship directly.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you're running your own Etsy shop, how do other sellers or the broader Etsy community talk about using AI?

User: It's really just me, myself, and I. I'm not really involved in any broader Etsy community, so I couldn't say.

AI: Got it - so you're really navigating this on your own and making your own decisions about how to incorporate AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I tried to find the message exchange, but it was too difficult to find. Basically, there was a customer who was absolutely horrible. I was able to write out the things I really wanted to say to this person, show it to AI, and have them adjust it to be professional. This was satisfying because I could say what I really wanted to say, didn't have to go through the frustration of filtering and fixing things I said myself, and still get to basically tell them off, but in a professional way that AI provided.

AI: That sounds like it was really cathartic - being able to express your frustration honestly first, then having AI help you channel that into something professional and appropriate. It's almost like having a diplomatic translator for your emotions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: What do you mean? Take over within my Etsy job? Where do you see AI taking over?

AI: I was thinking more broadly about any work skills - like the customer service writing and communication skills you mentioned, or potentially design work in the future. Do you ever think about whether relying on AI for help with professional emails might affect your own writing abilities over time?

User: I got you. Writing those emails isn't actually something I do too often. 90% of the communication is where a customer doesn't specify which designs they want, so I have to send them a note detailing the situation and ask them which ones they want, or don't want. Or sometimes customers have asked why delivery was taking so long, so I'd have to inform them I shipped it on time, tell them I only know what the tracking shows, and basically say hopefully it will be there soon. However, I have since changed my shipping package, which has resulted in no delivery issues. It would have actually been nice to have AI handle those sorts of interactions too, as it's really just giving the customer basic info, or getting basic info from them. I have no fear of losing my writing abilities for not 100% handling a customer service situation, not that I have great writing abilities as it is.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for new purposes as the technology develops?

User: It's possible. I could see it being useful if it were somehow more integrated with the Etsy platform, or if there was an area of the AI, or the AI could quickly recall a template message for me so I don't have type it out. A message such as the one needed for asking a customer what design they want to leave out from their order. I know companies already do this with standard copy paste messages, companies like Amazon, for example. If I could just click a button and the message would populate or send, that would be great.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as that neutral sounding board for customer service situations, and how you think about maintaining creative authenticity in your design work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to hear how you navigate using AI as a solo business owner, especially the balance between getting practical help and maintaining your own creative integrity.

I hope you have a great rest of your day!
