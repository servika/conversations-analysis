Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, I am ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use a lot of AI to help write emails and ensure I am writing good emails with all the necessary information I need in them. I also use AI if I have al ot of data and I need it sorted. Another way I use AI is to get ideas. For instance, if I need a new employee engagement activity I will ask AI

AI: That's helpful to understand those main areas where you're using AI. Let me dig a bit deeper into one of those.

When you mentioned using AI to help write emails, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you actually work with the AI when crafting those emails?

User: Typically I will write a rough draft of an email with the main ideas and then will ask AI to rewrite it and to add ideas that I have come up with.

AI: So you're starting with your own draft and then having AI build on that foundation. 

Tell me more about what happens after the AI rewrites your email - do you typically use what it gives you as-is, or do you find yourself making additional changes to it?

User: I will normally read it and then ask ai to change things or add things. I often find myself saying rewrite using more of my original language to the model

AI: That's really interesting - you're asking it to incorporate more of your original language back in. 

What is it about your original language that you want to preserve? What tends to get lost when the AI does that initial rewrite?

User: AI sometimes sounds too robotic or perfect. I am not perfect and don't want to sound perfect to my coworkers

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you want to maintain your authentic voice with colleagues. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Because I work in HR I sometimes handle tasks that have alot of PII that I don't feel comfortable using ai for

AI: That's a really important consideration in your field. Beyond the PII concern, are there other types of work tasks where you think "I'd rather do this myself" even when AI could potentially assist?

User: creativity tasks I generally like to do so I am less likely to use AI. Maybe I will use AI to get ideas but then will do the actual task myself

AI: So you'll use AI as a brainstorming partner for creative work, but then take over the actual execution yourself.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently

AI: Interesting - so you tend to hand off complete tasks rather than working back and forth throughout. But earlier you mentioned going back and forth with AI on emails, asking it to rewrite using more of your original language. 

How do you think about that difference? What makes emails more of a collaborative process for you while other tasks get delegated completely?

User: Hmmm good point, I didn't think about that. I guess I do go back and forth. Although emails are something that is more personal so I guess I involve myself more, wit other tasks I don't feel like that so I tend to let AI take over

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the more personal nature of emails makes you want to stay more involved in shaping them.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: With the world being more remote it allows us to use AI more freely and to get our work done more quickly

AI: That's an interesting point about remote work creating more freedom to use AI. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I remember making an inventory list off a old very disorganized excel document, if I wouldn't of had ai it would have taken me hours to go through it. With ai i was able to copy and paste the sheet in ai and all the sudden have an inventory list fully organized. This was satisfying

AI: That sounds like a huge time-saver! Hours of manual work reduced to minutes - I can see why that felt so satisfying.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I feel as though my writing skills may suffer if I am always using ai to rewrite my work and make it better

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about your writing skills. Do you do anything specific to address that, or is it more something you're aware of but haven't acted on yet?

User: I just feel as though when I am using the ai I am not actively using my brain to find better words or ensure my grammar is the best it can be

AI: That makes sense - you're concerned about becoming dependent on AI for those fundamental writing skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will slowly use it more and more. Especially with different ai's coming out with different things they can do and specialize in

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to maintain your authentic voice in emails and your awareness of how AI use might impact your writing skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope thats it

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with authenticity, and thinking carefully about skill development, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
