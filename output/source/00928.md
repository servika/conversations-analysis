Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. Let's get this party started.

AI: Great! I love the energy. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure. I often seek assistance when typing emails to clients.  I discuss a lot of tax related subject matter and this can be a confusing topic for many. I typically type out a message and then I'll use an AI model to tailor it to my specific client. For example, if I need simplistic language or something more linear like a vertical bullet point listing, I'll drop in my email and ask AI to reformat accordingly. When I'm brainstorming, I'll use AI to help me tap into my creative side, etc.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI as a communication translator of sorts, adapting your expertise for different audiences. 

When you mention brainstorming and tapping into your creative side, what does that look like in practice? Can you walk me through a specific example of how AI helps with your creative process?

User: Sure. I don't get to use this as much in my work place as my personal life, but when I want to create a visual for a client, like a flow chart or holiday correspondence, I have used AI to help me format layouts.  This has been for graphic emails and also for physical prints.  For office parties, I may ask it to help me plan office games. For example, I might say something like, "I want to use a lazy susan to create an office party game. What are some tax related funny questions I can ask?" Stuff like that.

AI: That's a fun way to blend your tax expertise with office culture! I'm curious about something you mentioned - you said you don't get to use the creative side as much in your workplace as in your personal life. 

What influences that difference? Is it workplace culture, the nature of your role, or something else that shapes how you use AI creatively at work versus personally?

User: I have a child so my personal life offers a substantially higher rate of opportunity to be creative - crafts, party planning, etc. I work in an accounting firm and by nature, most of the work is processing data and documents, preparing preformatted financials. Occasionally, there may be an opportunity to create charts/graphs, but not that often.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the contrast between parenting creativity and accounting precision is striking.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it to reformat emails and occasionally for visual layouts. Are there certain tasks in your accounting work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I have used AI to help me with tax projections with mediocre results. For example, when working on a tax projection for a client who changed jobs and started drawing retirement, I needed to estimate his annual income, annual federal withholdings at a single rate, estimate his retirement withholdings at a single rate and then run different scenarios based on the data collected. This created a bit of a challenge with the model I used and it did not calculate the taxes or the withholdings with great accuracy. While I will still use AI to help me with these types of tasks, I will manually prepare my own year to date earnings estimates and withholding estimates so I know the figures are accurate.  I always prepare my email and then ask AI to fix it.  I don't typically ask AI to strait reply to a response because I want to feel like I'm submitting my own work.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making. It sounds like accuracy and ownership are important factors in how you decide what to delegate versus what to keep control of.

When you say you want to feel like you're submitting your own work, can you tell me more about that? What does "your own work" mean to you when AI is involved in the process?

User: I don't want to copy and paste.  It feels like plagiarism.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it. So you've found this middle ground where you draft your own content first, then use AI to refine it rather than having AI generate from scratch.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you lean more toward collaboration - working back and forth with it - rather than just handing off complete tasks. Is that accurate, or does it vary depending on what you're working on?

User: Yes, very much it's mostly a collaborative activity.  Typically, I will bring the problem, provide how I want to handle it and ask for feedback.  This is the same pattern for any type of work I need help with. It may be the email scenario. It may be that I've put together a tax saving strategy list for a client with children and I ask AI if I've missed anything. But yes, it is very back and forth.  If I don't like the way something looks or reads, I'll make suggestions, etc. I usually know what I want to say and how I want it to come across so I already have a starting point and don't need to start cold.  Occasionally, I might go to AI with something like, "Just had a rude client come in here and throw a hissy fit about how he owes the IRS. Got any suggestions on words of comfort because I'm not feeling empathetic today. I told this man to make his estimated tax payments."

AI: Ha! That last example really paints a picture - using AI as an emotional reset button when you need to find your professional empathy again. That's such a human way to use it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at your firm using it similarly, or are you kind of figuring this out on your own?

User: No, my boss loves AI and uses it for literally everything.  He's who really got me using it more at work.  I will go to him with simple questions when I want some feedback and 8/10 times he will whip out some AI model and use it to answer me - like I couldn't have done that. I had a personal thing going on recently and asked him a simple question on what his personal feelings were and that man started typing away. My other coworker has only recently started using it.  I showed her how I like to use it to help with document preparations and emails.  She likes it.

AI: That's hilarious - your boss turning to AI even when you're asking for his personal opinion! It sounds like there's quite a range of adoption styles in your office.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation that created that strong reaction?

User: The most frustrating event was the one I mentioned earlier when the income projections and tax withholding calculations were incorrect. That was frustrating because I was using AI to help me save time but ended up taking extra time to redo manual calculations.  Other than that, nothing significant comes to mind. Occasionally, I have had to repeat myself with AI and explicitly tell it to stop doing things that I find annoying or it's been repetitive. But once I tell it quit, it does.

AI: That time-wasting scenario with the tax calculations sounds genuinely aggravating - especially when you're trying to be efficient and it backfires.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it just naturally happen through your collaborative approach?

User: I don't really understand what you are asking

AI: Let me rephrase that - I was asking about whether you worry about your skills getting rusty in areas where you use AI help. 

For instance, since you use AI to help polish your emails, do you ever think about whether you might lose your own writing abilities? Or is that not really a concern for you?

User: I don't worry about that for me - because I always write my own emails and documents. Then I submit it for proofreading, reframing, etc.  When I like what the AI has done and think it's better than what I did, I look it over and see how I can improve myself. I adapt and use that to enhance my future work.  However, I have seen (ahem - boss) people direct copy and paste the AI output and use it directly. And while there might not be anything exactly wrong with this, I am worried about how it may lead to a lack of thought in society.  I'm concerned that critical thinking and creative skills will decline.  And what about human ability to read and interpret subject matter on our own? I have used AI to help me understand and interpret things I've read and struggled to understand the concept discussed. But what about people who skip reading all together? If they just dump a bunch of documents into you and ask you what it said - how do they know you are being honest and telling the truth? I guess I'm worried about people becoming dumber and lazier.

AI: That's a really compelling distinction you're making - using AI as a learning tool versus a replacement for thinking. Your concern about people potentially "becoming dumber and lazier" touches on something pretty fundamental about how we interact with these tools.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself sticking with this collaborative approach, or do you think it might change as the technology improves?

User: I imagine I will mostly use it collaboratively. As it evolves and becomes more efficient with mathematics in the way I use it, I would have no problem relying on it with calculations or even assisting with spreadsheet layouts, etc.  With the correct programming, I believe the AI model will make less mathematical errors than me, a human.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - trusting it more as it gets better at the technical accuracy that's so crucial in your field.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that collaborative approach and your concerns about people potentially losing critical thinking skills when they skip the learning process entirely.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all that comes to mind today.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between collaboration and maintaining ownership of your work, plus your thoughtful concerns about how society might use these tools, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through all of this with me today!
