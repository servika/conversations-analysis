Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work from home and have two businesses. One is a direct sales business. For this, I use AI to help me with creating social media posts, texts, and emails. I also use it for brainstorming promotional campaigns. 

The second role I have is as a writer. My first novel is about to be published. I used AI in the creative process of creating the novel. It is a period piece, so I used AI to make sure I accurately represented Victorian England- the language, the history, and culture. I also used AI to create graphics for the book cover.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across two very different types of work. 

Tell me more about how you used AI during the creative process for your novel. What did that collaboration look like day-to-day when you were writing?

User: I created an outline of the story and wrote step-by-step working through the story from start to finish. AI did not write the novel for me, although it tried to at times. I used it to play several roles. 

It was sometimes an editor. When I was unsure of the historical accuracy of a section I would paste it into the AI and ask if if was historically accurate. I found I had to be careful, because it wasn't always correct and I found myself needing to double check things- particularly after it suggested I have a character send an email, which would not have been an option in Victorian England. 

Other times I used it to brainstorm. For instance, I might ask AI the likelihood of "A" versus "B" occurring in a given situation. Also, if I got stuck with phrasing a thought I would ask it to give me some suggestions I could work with. 

Finally, I used it to create the cover art for the novel. It struggled following my instructions with this, but I did get enough different options that I was able to take them and manually edit them to get what I wanted.

AI: That email suggestion in Victorian England is quite a catch! It sounds like you developed a real sense of when to trust AI's input and when to verify it yourself.

When you were brainstorming with AI about the likelihood of different scenarios, what made you decide to collaborate with it on those decisions rather than just working through them on your own?

User: In some situations, I was unaware of the statistical likelihood of one scenario over another. I hoped that AI would be better at it than was I.

AI: That makes sense - using AI's broader knowledge base for those statistical insights you might not have had access to otherwise.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I did not want AI writing the book for me. I only wanted it as an assistant. I believe it's a mistake to let AI do entire tasks in the creative arena. It would not have truly been my novel if AI had written it for me. Also, AI can and does make mistakes (no offense).

AI: None taken at all - that's a really important distinction you're making between using AI as an assistant versus having it take over the creative work entirely.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: That depends. For the novel is was an assistant while I did the work. For my direct sales business the more it can do for me the better.

AI: That's a really clear distinction between the two contexts. 

Tell me more about what makes you comfortable having AI do more complete tasks for your direct sales business. What's different about that work compared to your novel writing?

User: Writing the novel was a creative, artistic process. My direct sales business involves connecting with people via electronic media (texts, email, social media). I created a GPT in ChatGPT called "[REDACTED]", which has all the basic information about my Mary Kay business. I can simply ask it for a new Monday Meeting post and it does it for me. It helps me work faster.

AI: So you've essentially trained a specialized version of AI for your Mary Kay business - that's really smart. It sounds like speed and efficiency are key drivers there, whereas with the novel it was more about maintaining your creative voice.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work at home, so nobody is here with me except my cat and dog. I am a technically oriented person by nature, so using the latest and greatest tools comes naturally to me. I've been more of an influence on my Mary Kay colleagues in this regard than they have been on me, since I can help them learn to do what I'm doing.

AI: It sounds like you're actually a bit of a pioneer in your Mary Kay network when it comes to AI use - that's interesting that you're the one introducing these tools to others.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My frustrations usually occur when it comes to asking for graphics. Most AIs don't follow the instructions as well as they should- even when I've provided an image for context. 

I feel satisfied when AI brainstorms with me and takes an idea I had and makes it even better.

AI: That contrast is really telling - the satisfaction when AI enhances your ideas versus the frustration when it doesn't execute your specific visual instructions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Again, that depends. In creative endeavors, such as writing, it's a mistake to allow AI to do the work for you. When the humanity is taken out of art it ceases to be art. 

As far as technical tasks, like I've spoken of for my Mary Kay business, it's just another tool in my quiver. Since sales is ultimately about connecting with people, AI can help keep my name in front of customers, but it can't replace the face-to-face interactions we have together. 

When a new technology comes around that can perform tasks faster and with more accuracy, people have always feared for their jobs. Yet, time has shown that with these new technology new kinds of jobs are created around them.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - distinguishing between the human elements that should be preserved and the technical tasks where efficiency gains make sense.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm excited to see the future developments of AI. For my Mary Kay business, I'm hoping to see more automation tools where it works with other apps, such as social media or email. For creative processes, it will always be an assistant to me. I use a music AI called Suno to create musical tracks to songs I compose. I'm creating songs based on the novel to use for promotional purposes. I could let it write the lyrics and music for me to concepts I put in a prompt, but choose instead to create those myself and have the AI create the orchestra tracks, since I am unable to do that myself.

AI: Those promotional songs based on your novel sound like a really creative marketing approach! It's clear you've found a thoughtful balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your creative ownership.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've developed such clear boundaries about when to collaborate with AI versus when to maintain full creative control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing creative integrity with practical efficiency, and how you've become a pioneer in introducing AI tools to your Mary Kay network, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
