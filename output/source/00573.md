Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I use AI in a number of ways. The job for a start is basically a business admin role focusing on cloud computing, and the role requires a varied number of tasks, a mix of basic tech support internal IT, along with some more technical stuff, and finally basic administrative stuff or stuff that takes a fairly long time but is quite basic. I use AI firstly as a basic troubleshooting method and for identifying error codes, on the tech support side if I don't really know what to do it can very quickly provide feedback and ways to fix it, this is especially good for the internal IT section where often its a piece of software isn't working as intended and I'm at the users desk with no real clue how to fix it AI can generate up more often than not very effective troubleshooting advice. Part if the tech support and admin is sending and receiving emails: receiving on some occasion is more bloated and hard to understand so AI can help dissect the message, and on the sending often I doubt my emails, or think I might be misunderstood or at times have written it overly sarcastically so getting an AI to rewrite it so the message is professional is key.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated across different aspects of your role. 

Tell me more about that moment when you're at a user's desk with a software issue you haven't encountered before. What does that interaction with AI typically look like in those situations?

User: So we'll use the software example, there's a piece of software that is running as intended, as it's an organised managed device it is probably the policies stopping it. Firstly I don't immediately turn to AI, I would do brief troubleshooting, closing and reopening, but if that doesn't work I'd normally calmly suggest googling the answer and then using an AI model to try and get the answer. Sometimes this might only give one solution which can then be resolved quickly, or it might give some troubleshooting suggestions that are slightly more advanced than the basic ones. I think the benefit of this is just being able to get the search done quicker and presented neater than trying to google it going to a page and so on. This means that the troubleshooting is solved quicker and the user is less likely to get fustrated.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned suggesting to google the answer first before using AI. What leads you to take that approach rather than going straight to AI?

User: It's not actually googling the answer, that's just what I tell the user who has the problem. Then I would go to my phone and use AI to solve it. It still feels like saying lets ask AI isn't as accepted as lets google it, so it's more slightly misleading the user so they feel like I'm doing something, and its not just well I might as well have done that.

AI: Ah, that makes sense - so there's still a social element to consider around AI use. That's really insightful.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think I would be happy to use AI in most tasks, I think it's less I prefer to do it myself and more I don't trust the AI to be able to do it as accurately as it needs to do. Often particularly on say setting up a graph or a chart it can be very hard to get the AI to generate exactly what I'm imagining and AI's are less good at making very minor changes to something it generates, for example on a flow chart I might want one box to be a different colour and specify explicitly do not change anything else and it will just change everything and break something else. In these scenarios I feel I have to do it myself rather than "negotiate" with the AI to give me what I want.

AI: That's a really vivid example with the flowchart - that frustration of trying to get exactly what you need when it keeps changing other things. 

When you do use AI for work tasks, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle on its own?

User: I much rather the back and forth approach, particularly with troubleshooting and email writing this is very much take a question and it will resolve immediately. On the bigger projects I think it leads back to my previous problem which is if something isn't quite right you aren't able to make the minor changes to it, you just have to restart whereas more back and forth you can take part of the solution and then if anything goes wrong you aren't restarting.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping control and being able to course-correct rather than starting over completely.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: At my company AI uptake is perhaps a little slower than it should be, I've noticed new starters are much more happy to immediately integrate AI and get it used in their work, whereas those who have worked there longer use it much less. We also have a few colleagues who are experts in AI, they sell and teach other companies in how to utilise AI effectively and they can be very effective in offering input, knowing where AI can and can't be used. I think another consideration is company policies over AI, because there is in many cases a lack of trust in some AI's as well as natural data concerns there is some level of restriction in the use of AI and any kind of customer data use is much more restricted. This means that for any basic admin tasks which often require customer data to be entered, there is less room for using AI.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - the generational difference in adoption and those data restrictions creating boundaries around where you can actually use it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: On the satisfied front, I was given advice to add improved system instructions for troubleshooting which aimed to give more direct answers and less wordy pleasantries which improved the answers. It also is vert satisfying when you give an AI a problem or an error code that I don't have a clue what it does and it immediately solves the problem. On the frustration side, it would be both the very minor changes that seem very hard to effectively do, as well as perhaps minor inaccuracies when working with copying data and relaying it elsewhere which I find very quickly defeats the benefits of it doing repetitive admin work when I often have to go and rewrite it.

AI: Those are such concrete examples - the immediate relief when it solves a mystery error code versus that sinking feeling when you realize you'll need to double-check and fix data it was supposed to handle automatically.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think maximising my ability in using AI to do these tasks is key as while AI is going to take over these jobs becoming an expert in AI usage where and how it can be used is rather key and in the medium term I imagine would have key career benefits. Once it fully takes over it will be a much tougher situation, so being able to adapt and find a niche working within the AI is key.

AI: That's a really pragmatic perspective - positioning yourself as someone who can bridge that gap and work effectively with AI systems.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I would expect further cooperation, my company is certainly becoming more liberal with the use of AI and whilst there are still restriction when considering data, using it more and more when it gets better and better is a win win. I would hope to somehow get it to do these repetitive tasks that realistically it should do incredibly well in which would lighten my workload. I imagine that if I can do that and sell it to management it would lead to an internal promotion working with AI within the organisation and making sure employees are using it effectively but also safely.

AI: That sounds like a really strategic vision - using your hands-on experience to potentially become the person who helps the organization navigate AI adoption more broadly.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that social dynamic of telling users you're "googling" when you're actually using AI, and how you're thinking strategically about positioning yourself as AI becomes more integrated.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think the only other point is on the company restrictions, and I think more commonly, co-pilot is often much more open than say ChatGPT or Gemini. Because its a Microsoft product, and its integrated within their software that is also the default AI option, and where at work I have used alternative AI's, I've found they've done the task better or more accurately over Copilot, but because it's Microsoft that AI is much more encouraged.

AI: That's a really valuable point - the corporate comfort level with certain AI tools based on existing vendor relationships, even when other options might perform better for specific tasks. That ecosystem integration seems to be a significant factor in workplace AI adoption.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in a business environment - from navigating social perceptions to dealing with data restrictions to thinking strategically about career development - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you for participating - your perspectives were really insightful and will definitely contribute to our understanding of how AI is being integrated into workplace environments. Have a great rest of your day!
