Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I would say that AI doesn't fit into my workday, everyday. Rather, AI fits into my workday sometimes. A typical way in which AI fits into my workday will be: 
-Using the AI summary for web searches--Often times I need to find a quick, troubleshooting answer for an IT problem and the AI summary can, at times, be more effective than going through the different web search results. However, at times, the summary is off base on topic OR includes incorrect or misguiding steps, in which case it's not helpful. 
-Using AI to help me with a marketing or publicity graphic--it can be helpful to break out of a creative roadblock by getting some AI help with an overall design or with finding an element I am missing. Graphic design is not a major component of my job but sometimes I need to create signage or some graphics for social media, etc.

AI: That's helpful - so it sounds like AI is more of an occasional tool rather than something woven throughout your entire day. 

Tell me more about those IT troubleshooting situations. When the AI summary does work well for you, what makes it more effective than going through the individual search results?

User: I agree--AI is an occasional tool at this point. 

Re: IT troubleshooting. When the AI summary works, it helps by, usually, finding the most common solution and it really helps by cutting down to the meat of the content. Meaning, I don't have to scroll through all the introductory "stuff" at the beginning of a blog post or slog through screens full of advertising. It helps me get help more quickly.

AI: That makes sense - cutting through all that extra content to get straight to the solution. 

You mentioned that sometimes the AI summary can be off-topic or include incorrect steps. How do you typically handle those situations when the AI summary isn't helpful? Do you have a way of recognizing when it's going wrong?

User: I typically handle this situation by either clarifying my prompt/search terms if I can (maybe it was too vague or did not include helpful edition or version information for software that could help) or by going through my own screening of search results. 

It really depends on the situation that helps me determine if the summary is wrong. Sometimes, the steps don't match the interface. For example, if I searched on how to do something in Windows 10 and the steps don't match what I'm seeing, that could be wrong info in the summary. other times, briefly reading the summary indicates that the summary is going wrong because it just doesn't make sense. Maybe the model picked up on a key word that led it off base or something. But sometimes, I can just "tell."

AI: Interesting - you've developed a sense of when something just doesn't feel right with the AI response. That intuition about when you can "just tell" something is off is really valuable.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Hmmm. Although a lot of times AI can serve as a springboard for my own research, I do prefer to do my own deep dive research on my own. I don't "trust" AI enough at this point. It is good for preliminary looks at things. I definitely prefer to do my own digestion of news and current affairs. Again, I don't trust AI to summarize without verifying.

AI: That distinction between using AI as a "springboard" versus doing the deep dive yourself is really interesting. 

When you say you don't trust AI enough for that deeper research, what specifically concerns you? Is it accuracy, or something else about how AI processes or presents information?

User: I would need to know where the information is coming from that AI is using to synthesize the response. For example, news is full of biases. Without knowing what news sources, how much of each, what priority was placed on each, etc. I cannot, in confidence, only consume from an AI summary. In my own news consumption, I use websites like allsides.com to get news from multiple sources and with multiple biases to find the truth somewhere in the middle. I don't know that AI is, or even can do that, at this point. So, accuracy and bias are a huge concern. With scholarly or other research, I need to also know the sources. AND I need to have confidence that the sources are real and relevant.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - wanting to understand the sourcing and being conscious of bias. It sounds like transparency in how AI reaches its conclusions is crucial for you to feel comfortable relying on it for important information.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Transparency is hugely important. 

I tend to collaborate throughout a task or to start it. Rarely do I delegate an entire task. With the exception of design tasks. I may not edit a design beyond what AI produces if I like it.

AI: That makes sense - mostly collaboration except for design work where you might accept the output as-is if it works for you.

Can you walk me through what that collaboration looks like in practice? For instance, when you're working on something together, how do you typically go back and forth with the AI?

User: I might say something like "Hi model, I'm working on this and I'm searching for sources, any ideas?" Or "Hi model, I'm stuck with this design and I would really like it to incorporate A, B, and C." and then go back and forth to refine from there. Usually my interactions are relatively short, again using AI most often as a springboard for my own work.

AI: That's a nice picture of how you use it - short, focused interactions to get unstuck or get started. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it, or have there been any policies or discussions that have shaped how you approach it?

User: We really don't use it much in my workplace as a whole. A few people here and there use it similarly to how I do. There is some apprehension about it's accuracy. Others are wary of how it will affect information literacy, as well. We don't talk about it consistently anymore but it is something that everyone is aware of at this point.

AI: It sounds like your workplace is still figuring out where AI fits, with some healthy skepticism mixed in. The concern about information literacy is interesting - that seems to connect back to your own preference for doing deep research yourself.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have been frustrated in the past when using AI without realizing it! When AI models were added to search engines, at times they were added very subtly and people did not realize that the summaries they were consuming as facts were AI created. I found that frustrating, as I want to know what I am using. 

I have been very satisfied with quick and effective troubleshooting results. Usually when I am looking for help I am in a rush and maybe even frustrated--getting quick help is a relief.

AI: That's such an important point about transparency - being frustrated when you didn't even know you were using AI. It sounds like having that choice and awareness is really important to you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is not something I actively consider. A lot of my job is reacting to situations on the fly and planning and big picture "stuff." I have a hard time imagining AI taking over a lot of what I do. Now, were I to become confident enough in AI to let it do research and such for me, maintaining skills would have to be an active and proactive process, as it is a perishable skill.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - your job involving a lot of reactive, situational work that feels hard to replace. And the insight about research skills being perishable if you don't use them is really thoughtful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, differently, or staying about the same?

User: Probably about the same, perhaps a bit more. When using AI, it's often as a matter of it being in front of me at the right time rather than thinking "hey, this is a project I can do with AI." I more often use integrated tools.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it's more about convenience and what's available in the moment rather than actively seeking out AI for specific tasks.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on transparency and wanting to know when you're using AI, as well as your careful approach to research and information verification.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no. thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the importance of transparency, the need for source verification, and how AI fits into your work as an occasional springboard tool will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
