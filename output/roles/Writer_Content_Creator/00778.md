Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, and I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a writer, I use Claude to help me with story research, development, and draft writing. I generally use Claude every day, although each day's use looks slightly different (e.g. some days are very research-heavy while others are more creatively driven).

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become a regular part of your creative process. 

Can you walk me through what a research-heavy day versus a creatively driven day looks like when you're working with Claude?

User: Absolutely! On research days, I ask Claude very specific questions related to the background material of a story I'm developing. For example, I might inquire about historical events, geographical details, or logistical questions like how long it would take a character to fly from Vancouver to London. On a creative day, my questions are more about collaborating with Claude rather than seeking external answers. For instance, I might use Claude to help plot a book, develop a character, or establish backstory. On particularly creative days, we write together! I have Claude write a chapter—using all the project materials—that I can then refine, either by myself or through prompts that have Claude implement my revisions.

AI: That's really interesting how you distinguish between using Claude as an information source versus as a creative collaborator. 

When you're in that collaborative writing mode - especially when Claude writes a chapter that you then refine - how does that process feel compared to writing something entirely from scratch yourself?

User: I find it much easier than writing something entirely from scratch! In this case, Claude acts as a kind of "scaffold" I can build upon. It lets me see a "live" version of, say, a chapter. This helps me evaluate whether an idea is working or if we need to go back to the development stage. The words Claude writes might not end up in the final story draft, but that's okay; I'm mainly interested in seeing the story in an early form.

AI: That's a really compelling way to think about it - Claude as a scaffold that lets you see your ideas in action. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of your writing process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Yes! I still personally handle the entire final draft (although I might ask Claude to check for any inconsistencies or ambiguities). This is mainly because I need to ensure the story maintains a distinct "voice," and I don't believe Claude is quite at the level to develop a unique, sustained voice that can run throughout the entire book.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that consistent voice throughout a full work seems like such a crucial element of storytelling.

When you do use Claude for tasks like checking inconsistencies or developing plot and characters, how do you typically structure that interaction? Are you more likely to work back and forth with Claude on these elements, or do you tend to give it a complete brief and let it handle a task independently?

User: I'll work back and forth because sometimes Claude can lose the thread of my original query when working with an entire manuscript. I find that Claude works best in assessing smaller story chunks. (This is actually something I would like Claude to improve on, as assessing inconsistencies and ambiguities is best done with an entire manuscript, not portions of the story). Let's say Claude notices that something said in Chapter 1 conflicts with something said in Chapter 3. I'll take that information and tell Claude how to alter it. We proceed this way for the rest of the story.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about working in smaller chunks versus having that full manuscript view. It sounds like there's a bit of a trade-off there.

How have your colleagues or your writing community influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or approaches that have shaped how you think about incorporating Claude into your process?

User: Definitely! First of all, AI now truly permeates our work - even for those of us deeply dedicated to the craft of writing; we all talk about it constantly. Interestingly, most attitudes are positive. We see Claude as an extremely efficient assistant (though one that can make mistakes). I probably use Claude the most for story development; many of my colleagues restrict their use to research only. This is likely because I develop a lot of genre fiction (although my personal writing isn't in this category), an area that is seeing a lot of AI use for actual writing.

AI: That's really interesting how the attitudes are generally positive and how genre fiction seems to be leading the way with AI integration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've recently been frustrated with AI issues related to timelines in a story. For example, in a single chapter, a paragraph that should be at the end is instead placed at the beginning. There are no clear reasons for this, and it's a frustrating mistake to see.

AI: That timeline confusion does sound really frustrating - especially when there's no clear logic to why it happened.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when working with Claude left you feeling particularly satisfied or accomplished? What made that experience stand out?

User: Absolutely! Lately, I've had to do a lot of research on Jungian psychology for a book I'm working on. Claude has done a fantastic job helping me streamline much of my research. Because I've been immersed in a lot of material related to this topic, I can also tell that Claude has been very accurate in the answers it's been giving me, and this is so encouraging to see.

AI: That's wonderful - having that deep knowledge yourself to verify Claude's accuracy must make it feel like such a reliable research partner.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about it, but I'm not overly worried. Since I work in a very creative industry that values originality, there is still a large market for human-driven ideas and unique voices. Certain areas of my industry—such as proofreading—might be affected, but I believe AI will ultimately encourage us to improve our own writing.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing AI as potentially pushing the field toward higher standards rather than just replacing human creativity.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will gradually use it more for academic research, as I currently do this myself by manually crawling through research papers to ensure their relevance. I also plan to explore better ways to automate— or at least assist with— some of the routine administrative tasks of work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on Claude as a scaffold for seeing your ideas come to life, and how the writing community's generally positive attitudes have shaped your approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all, thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to understand how you navigate that balance between collaboration and maintaining creative control in your writing process.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
