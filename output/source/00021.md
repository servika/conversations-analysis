Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds Good! No questions here. Let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a graphic designer/web designer, with additional skills in web development. I typically work on a wide range of projects from logo design, branding system development, website design, packaging, presentations, motion graphics, and video production. I typically work in a very fast-paced environment with tight deadlines.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly diverse and demanding workload! With all those different types of projects and tight deadlines, I imagine you're always looking for ways to work efficiently.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I will sometimes use AI for small tasks to help jumpstart my creativity or come up with some baseline ideas, for example to come up with ideas for memorable headlines or taglines. I've used it for code a couple times, although its sometimes easier for me to just build things myself so that I can structure the code in accordance with my personal workflow. The majority of the AI that I use within my process is using generative AI for imagery. For example, every designer knows the feeling of finding the perfect image for their design, only to find out it wont fit right within the layout. With generative AI, I'm able to quickly extend image backgrounds, change the color of clothing, remove elements from the background, add objects that aren't there, etc. These are all tasks that would have taken hours worth of cloning or splicing parts of different images together in order to look at best, slightly unnatural. Now with generative AI, all this can be expertly completed in under a minute with incredible accuracy.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become particularly powerful for you in solving those specific image challenges that used to eat up so much time. The example you gave about finding the perfect image but it doesn't fit the layout perfectly really resonates.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: The most recent project was designing album artwork that I created by using AI generated images from Adobe Firefly, I then spliced elements from them a bunch of images together to create a cohesive image. I used generative AI to add details that weren't there like flames and light effects, and to fix certain details on someone's face. For me, it was really exciting to see how all of this imagery was created just by simply imagining something in my head, me describing it, and then seeing it show up on the screen moments later, often better than I had even imagined it.

AI: That sounds like such an exciting creative experience! The way you describe going from imagination to description to seeing something even better than you envisioned appear on screen - that's really compelling.

When you're working with AI like that, especially when you're splicing together multiple AI-generated images and adding details, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I definitely feel like I'm art directing the AI. Essentially I feel like I'm the one telling it WHAT to do, and the AI gets to decide HOW it's going to do it. I feel like it does a good job most of the time.

AI: That's a really insightful way to frame it - you as the art director setting the vision and the AI as the executor figuring out the technical implementation. It sounds like you feel you maintain creative control over the direction.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Not many other than the speed at which I'm able to manipulate images to fit my specific needs. It's something that used to require a lot of grunt work. Now I can quickly change images to be exactly how I need them, rather than spend hours tweaking the image in Photoshop. This gives me more time to focus on the creative.

AI: That's a great point about freeing up time for the actual creative work by eliminating the grunt work. It sounds like AI has become almost like having a really skilled technical assistant.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do have concerns that the workforce is going to be significantly reduced because less people and less time is needed to complete the grunt work that AI takes care of. I also feel that the accessibility of strategic visual AI is going to cause a decreased need to hire creative people for projects, for example things like photography, branding, logo design, web design, etc. Therefore, its quite scary that my industry might be completely wiped out just as my career in this field is beginning.

AI: That's a really honest and understandable concern, especially being relatively early in your career and seeing these rapid changes happening. The tension between AI making your current work more efficient while potentially threatening the broader job market in your field is quite complex.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I feel like it will inevitably get better and be able to do much more complex tasks like completing comprehensive design projects from start to finish, for free, with no additional costs for future revisions. Essentially, its capabilities will eventually be able to do everything a professional designer can do with unlimited amount of creative skills. For example, a human designer might know how to design logos and build websites,  but they might not know how to edit professional videos or how to develop the websites themselves. Meanwhile, an AI designer would know how to do all of these things at an expert level, causing the human designer to be outmatched and obsolete.

AI: You've painted a very vivid picture of where you see things heading - AI becoming this kind of omniskilled creative generalist that can handle every aspect of design and development seamlessly. That's quite a sobering vision, especially given how rapidly you've already seen AI capabilities advance even in the short time you've been using these tools.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated how you described yourself as art directing the AI - that relationship dynamic was really illuminating - and your honest perspective on both the immediate benefits you're experiencing and your longer-term concerns about the industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's pretty much it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a technical assistant while maintaining creative control, and your thoughtful perspective on both the efficiency gains and the broader industry concerns, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the exciting possibilities and the real anxieties about the future of creative work. That kind of honest, nuanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the full picture of how AI is impacting creative professionals.

Thanks again for participating in this research - it's been really valuable!
