Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not.

AI: Great, let's dive in then. Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am professional Game Master and a Game Designer. Currently, I have two different styles of project. 

The first is a regular game that prep for and run in person or online. I typically need graphics and personalities for these projects, but I mostly run prepared settings and works. 

The second is writing adventures for TTRPGs. This is a bit more like a traditional publication but the content is an adventure for a TTRPG.

AI: That's fascinating work! I can see how both of those would have really different creative demands - the immediate, responsive nature of running games versus the more structured writing process for adventures.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I typically use AI tools in the brainstorming step ("Give me some noir-style adventures that I can run in Neverwinter for levels 5-6"), to produce internal inspirational graphics ("Please show me a idea of Count Fitzelbitter, a human male about six foot, dark hair, floppish who carries a small umbrella, everywhere.") 

I also use specialized AI tools for editing (grammarly)

AI: That's really helpful - I can see how AI serves different functions at different stages. The brainstorming for adventure hooks, the visual inspiration for characters, and then the polishing with editing tools.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, I am starting a blog and I asked it for a list classic rpg modules to review. It really saved time when got started.

AI: Tell me more about that. What was it like getting that initial list from AI versus how you might have approached building that list before?

User: Before, I would have manually combed the internet looking for classic modules, but I would not had looked at all of the systems that AI put together. I would have had  a paper list with short 1-2 sentence descriptors, that would have taken me an afternoon to put together.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI not only saved you time but also broadened your scope beyond what you might have naturally considered. 

When you're working with AI in these situations, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I drive the creative decisions, AI has been quite disappointing in the creative department. The responses are generic and contrived,

AI: That's a really candid perspective. So it sounds like you see AI more as a research assistant or starting point rather than a creative partner. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I have more ideas, and a bigger backlog of things to get started on.

AI: That's intriguing - so AI is helping you generate more starting points and possibilities to work from. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: So, I discussed how AI creates a lot of lackluster creative product and that is one of the reasons that mostly use it for research. Well, the field is absolutely flooded with this work and that makes finding quality resources harder. It is like internet searches are becoming useless, because so much of the results are internet spam.

AI: That's a really important point - you're experiencing the downstream effects of AI-generated content flooding your field and making it harder to find genuine, quality resources. That sounds frustrating from both a creator and consumer perspective.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would like to integrate more multimedia into my projects. Not just images, but sound and possibly light video. I see AI helping with that.

AI: That's an exciting vision - expanding into multimedia elements that could really enhance the gaming experience. It sounds like you see AI as potentially opening up creative possibilities that might have been too time-intensive or technically challenging before.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a research tool and idea generator rather than a creative collaborator, and your concern about the quality dilution in your field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I do not think that Ai is responsible for the quality dilution, I think that AI is really impowering people who are comfortable with meh quality work to heavily automate their processes. In some ways, I feel like it is helping those of us who have higher standards really stand out.

AI: That's a really nuanced distinction - it's not AI itself causing the quality issues, but rather amplifying existing differences in standards and effort. That's a fascinating perspective on how AI might actually be creating more differentiation in the field rather than homogenizing it.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a research and brainstorming tool, the challenges of navigating an increasingly saturated market, and how quality standards are becoming more of a differentiator - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your thoughtful responses throughout our conversation.
