Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a freelance writer. On one of the platforms I use, I have several clients and teams I've joined that require using AI to assist with writing articles.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become part of your client requirements. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like on a typical day when you're working on these articles? How do you actually use the AI in your writing process?

User: It depends on the client or team. With one of the teams, they've provided the topic of the article and the initial prompt I need to enter. I'm then tasked with refining the prompt until I receive a suitable article. Before submitting the article, I edit it myself and make some additions to the content to ensure it matches the client's requirements. Once I spellcheck the article, I submit it.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow. So you're essentially acting as both a prompt engineer and an editor in that process.

When you're refining those initial prompts, what are you typically looking for? What makes you decide that the AI's output is "suitable" versus needing more prompt refinement?

User: I'm typically looking for a response by the AI that reads like it's written by a human, which isn't usually accomplished with the first prompt I send. Sometimes I'll need to add more details, such as the number of paragraphs and the types of section headers I want. An AI's output is "suitable" once I can use the article with minimal edits and additions.

AI: That's a really clear process. It sounds like you've developed a good sense for what works.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your writing work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I like writing the article intros and conclusions. While the AI often does a decent job with those aspects of an article, I tend to either heavily edit or replace them altogether to ensure they meet the high standards I have as a writer. The intro is particularly important because it's used to hook the reader, so I want to get it right.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the intro really sets the tone for everything that follows.

When you do work on these AI-assisted articles, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you start with prompt refinement, but once you get that suitable output, are you more likely to collaborate with the AI throughout your editing process, or do you tend to take the AI's output and then work on it independently from there?

User: It depends on the client. They often have strict rules. A couple clients prefer a single prompt, after which I'm left to edit and reword the whole paragraph. However, I usually collaborate with the AI through the editing process until the article is well-refined. Regardless, I still make some edits even after I've finished working with the AI.

AI: That's helpful to understand - so the client requirements really shape how much back-and-forth you can have with the AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're freelancing, I'm thinking about how other writers you know, or the expectations from these different client teams, have shaped your approach.

User: I don't interact much with colleagues. The platform has a forum and subsections for different writing teams that I sometimes need to use, but it doesn't happen often. Since each client and team has different expectations, I've shaped my approach based on their feedback. There are times when I've needed to make revisions to articles. I've also received feedback from clients after they've accepted the articles. For example, when I first started using AI to assist with writing articles, one of my clients said that the subject of the article I wrote wasn't close enough to what they wanted. I took that feedback and started using more specific prompts with the AI.

AI: That's a really practical approach - learning from that direct client feedback to refine your prompting strategy.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Basically, the first time I used AI to help with writing an article. Some of my clients forbid using AI. In that scenario, a 1,000 word article can take between 1.5-2.5 hours to write. The first time I used AI for one of my clients, I believe the article was around 1,200 words. I remember being highly satisfied because, even though I was still learning how to use AI, the entire process took less than an hour for me to obtain an article from the AI, edit it, and submit it.

AI: That's such a dramatic difference in time investment! That must have been quite a revelation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given that you have some clients who forbid AI use?

User: I try to consistently improve my writing so that clients always recognize my capabilities and continue requesting work. I also think my knowledge of how to effectively use AI will be beneficial in the future if an increasing number of clients start requesting AI to assist with articles.

AI: That's a really thoughtful balance - developing both your traditional writing skills and your AI collaboration skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What do you think that might look like for your freelance writing practice?

User: Based on the trends in the writing industry and many other industries, I believe I'll have an even closer relationship with AI at work in the years to come. The number of clients requesting AI has practically doubled this year. That trend doesn't seem like it will be slowing down anytime soon. I'm not sure how it will impact my freelance writing practice in the future, but it hasn't had a negative impact so far. There's less work available at times, but it's difficult to say what's the cause of that.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've learned to balance maintaining your own writing skills while also developing expertise in AI collaboration - that seems like such a key challenge many writers are navigating right now.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how client requirements are driving AI adoption, and how you've adapted your workflow to balance efficiency with quality, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
