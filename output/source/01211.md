Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, no questions so far!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One recent project was studying the mucosal barrier-lining of the gastrointestinal tract and the effect of drug delivery systems on that lining. Initial ideas included conducting research on the previous body of knowledge surrounding the GI tract and how we can find a gap within that research. Then, a lab full of students worked to study and try to recreate that lining. We were able to gather a lot of data about the properties of the GI tract to try to understand the next step, how our chemical-based delivery systems could fare against the lining.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - the intersection of drug delivery and the GI tract's protective mechanisms. I can picture that involving quite a complex research process from literature review through lab work to data analysis.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: The beginning research phase, I would say, used a lot of AI. Whether it was dissecting research articles to find a specific study and understanding parts of the research that I myself don't know very well, AI proved valuable to help start to conduct research as well as a little bit of experiment design later on

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI became a valuable research partner early on. Tell me more about how you used AI to dissect those research articles and understand unfamiliar concepts.

User: First I would start with keyword help - I asked the models to help identify key words about the GI tract that I may not know were originally common in the body of research. Then I would ask models to give me an overview of each, study by study, so that I could get a quick overview of each article before proceeding to read myself. AI was very helpful when I didn't understand a concept, as I could quickly ask and most of the time, receive a very correct answer

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI as both a knowledge guide and a research accelerator. You mentioned you'd verify that the AI gave you "very correct" answers most of the time. 

When you were using AI to understand these concepts or get article overviews, how did you go about checking or validating what it was telling you?

User: For the article overviews, I would still read the article myself after, I and my fellow researchers would still have the final say on including literature in our review. AI was used as a "first-scan" tool to weed out articles that would have nothing to do with the research.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as an initial screening tool while keeping human judgment for the final decisions. We're about a third of the way through our conversation now.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the actual lab work, data analysis, or writing up results - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas, or have you experimented there as well?

User: I have experimented with using AI for experimental design at times. I would use my lab first and then sometimes verify our conditions against AI to see if we were missing a study group. Typically, we avoiding AI for the experimental design setup as some of the treatment groups did not make sense. For example, once the AI failed to give a negative control group on the final check, so it could not be trusted at the time to produce a viable experimental plan. For data analysis, we just used other tools (JMP, python, etc).

AI: That's a really telling example about the missing negative control - it shows you've developed a good sense of when AI's suggestions don't align with proper experimental methodology. 

For the data analysis piece, you mentioned using JMP and Python instead of AI. Tell me more about that decision - what made those traditional tools the better choice for your analysis work?

User: We liked the consistency that the apps provided - when asking AI for an iterative set of graphs modeling a process, it will often miss out on formatting the same across multiple images. Also, a lot of the data analysis can be run many times on those apps, meaning the switch to AI has not been needed as much in that field

AI: That makes perfect sense - consistency and repeatability are crucial for scientific analysis. The formatting inconsistencies you mentioned could really complicate presenting findings or comparing results across experiments.

Here's my final question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Oooo thats a good one, I hadn't mentioned this before but it would be nice for AI to be able to provide strong critiques for your research. As for critiques, it could provide great practice before going up against an IRB or in presenting a topic after finalizing research. So far, critiques are very elementary.

AI: That's a really insightful point - having AI serve as a rigorous practice opponent before facing real scrutiny from IRBs or peer reviewers. It sounds like current AI critiques lack the depth and rigor that would actually prepare you for those high-stakes situations.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a screening and verification tool while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions were particularly valuable. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: For the most part, that's been all of the use of AI

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a "first-scan" tool while keeping human judgment for final decisions, and especially that example about the missing negative control, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's clear you've developed a thoughtful approach to integrating AI where it adds value while recognizing its limitations in areas requiring experimental rigor and consistency.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
