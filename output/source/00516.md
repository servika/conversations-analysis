Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a PhD researcher that also works as a software consultant for a third party company, they provide me with data, I write code, etc. My main use of AI in my typical workday is code completion or CoPilot in Visual Studio Code for debugging, brainstorming, etc.

AI: That's really interesting - you have two different professional contexts where you could potentially use AI. 

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction with AI looks like when you're debugging or brainstorming code? What does that process actually look like for you?

User: So, CoPilot has access to my entire workspace, when I'm having an issue I'll ask whats causing an error, why I might be seeing what I'm seeing. It ranges from something as simple as why the buttons on a GUI aren't the right style, to help on how to optimise a model during training

AI: That's helpful to understand the range. It sounds like you're using AI for everything from UI styling issues to complex model optimization.

When you mentioned brainstorming - can you tell me more about what that looks like? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI, or is it more like you describe a problem and it suggests solutions?

User: I more describe a problem, it presents a few solutions and then i take those and do research elsewhere, academic papers, forums, blogs, everything really. I use AI as the starting point. Oh, I also use it to help with creating graphs and stuff for presentations.

AI: So it sounds like AI serves as your initial brainstorming partner, then you take those ideas and validate them through other sources. That's a really interesting workflow.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: AI could definetely help with the research process more but I much prefer to do it myself, I just don't trust AI to be thourough enough

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - using AI as the starting point but not trusting it for the thorough research phase.

What is it specifically about the research process that makes you feel AI wouldn't be thorough enough? Is it something about how it searches, or the way it evaluates sources, or something else entirely?

User: The times I have used it its as if it forms its own opinions and then finds sources which back it up. It doesnt do a great job at looking at the whole picture

AI: That's a really sharp observation - the idea that it cherry-picks sources to support a predetermined view rather than surveying the full landscape.

Are there other tasks in your work where you've noticed this same pattern, or is this something you've specifically observed with research tasks?

User: Mainly research, I dont use it for much else. When it does decide on a solution for code its very hard on that, and almost impossible to get it move on. I was developing an app recently and I've never used XCode before so was quite out of my depth trying to create a live activity and it just kept telling me the same wrong solution over and over again until I gave up and just did it myself. Which is fine, I just wish it wouldnt be so hard up sometimes.

AI: That XCode example really illustrates what you're talking about - getting locked into one approach even when it's not working. 

When you say you "gave up and just did it yourself," how did you figure out the right solution? Did you end up finding it was something completely different from what the AI kept suggesting?

User: I stopped trying to do what the AI was telling me to and just took it back to what I knew and understood and worked my way up using forums, blog posts, documentation, etc.

AI: That's a really telling approach - going back to your own foundation and building up from there rather than following the AI's direction.

When you use AI for work, would you say you're more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task like you described with the brainstorming, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: with the brainstorming I collaborate throughout the whole project

AI: Can you tell me more about what that collaboration looks like throughout a whole project? How does the back-and-forth with AI evolve as you move from initial brainstorming to implementation?

User: I'll have an idea, ask the AI about it, it provides some thoughts, oftentimes some basic code, I'll implement it fully, ask for feedback and thoughts, work through the data and results, discuss, until I reach a conclusion I'm happy with

AI: That sounds like a really iterative process where you're both contributing different pieces. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: With my PhD it's not really relevent, it's an individual thing. With my work with the third party company we talk about AI's uses openly. I can't dicuss what we talk about as I'm under an NDA but there are certain tasks that would take a human a long time to do (they're also really boring) but AI could be purpose trained to do it quickly and accurately

AI: That's interesting - such different cultures around AI use between your PhD work and the consulting work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't discuss the details of that, can you rephrase in a way that I wouldn't use any specific examples? If that has to be the question I'll think of a way to answer it.

AI: Of course! Let me rephrase that.

When you think about your overall experience using AI for work, what kinds of situations tend to leave you feeling most satisfied with the interaction? And on the flip side, what kinds of situations tend to be most frustrating?

User: Most satisfying is when theres a massive spreadsheet tens of thousands of lines long that I would have to find a way to manually check over like a month but I used gemini with system instructions to filter it down to just a few hundred lines I needed to manually check. I dont really have an exmaple of a particulaly frustrating experience other than the XCode example

AI: That spreadsheet example is a perfect illustration of AI handling something that would be incredibly tedious for a human but well-suited for automated processing.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's not really something I actively consider, my work is creating AI. I'm not particularly scared of it taking over because I see all of its flaws

AI: That's such an interesting perspective - being on the creation side gives you a very different view of AI's limitations.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology improves, or do you think you'll maintain a similar approach?

User: I can see my relationship with AI becoming more dependant. I don't neccesarily want it but the corporate side of the work I do is always looking for buzz words and asking how we could use AI for this, that and the other. I think I'll end up using it more in daily life. We use it to take notes in meetings already

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how being involved in creating AI gives you a unique view of its limitations, and how different workplace cultures approach AI use so differently.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative collaboration process, the distinction between using AI as a starting point versus trusting it for thorough research, and how workplace culture influences AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
