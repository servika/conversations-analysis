Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: all good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use OpenAI's API for proofreading submissions to my website. I get a lot of user submissions for movie trivia, comments, etc., and proofreading them is quite tedious. Running them through AI to fix obvious issues with punctuation, spelling, etc. means very little other editing is needed.

Coding similarly - my website's self-built, and I'm competent enough in terms of PHP, javascript, mysql, etc., but AI is helpful for speeding up certain things. Rather than using google for the right command and then reworking what I find, I can explain what I need and then tweak the output directly.

AI: That sounds like you've found some really practical applications. When you're using AI for coding tasks, do you find yourself explaining the full context of what you're trying to build, or do you break it down into smaller, specific requests for individual functions or commands?

User: generally smaller requests - the changes I need to make tend to be smaller scale, and I trust it more for segmented things that I can check easily, rather than requesting major changes. The site itself would benefit from a redesign, but I don't fully trust AI to implement that yet

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like trust plays a big role in how you decide what to delegate. You mentioned you don't fully trust AI for major redesigns yet. Are there other types of tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Approving entries to my site - it's a long-standing movie trivia site, and while I can't verify all submissions as accurate, I've always taken pride in it being curated content, rather than just a free for all of user submissions. So while I trust AI for proofreading before I then check them, I don't yet trust it enough to make a reliable judgment call for what's a good/bad submission, whether the things people submit are relevant to the title, etc. That's improving slightly, I think it's probably in the scope of what AI could do if properly prompted, but for now I prefer to have human involvement, even if it's just a quick eyeball before things go online.

AI: That really highlights the personal investment you have in your site's quality. When you do use AI - like for the proofreading or coding tasks - how would you describe your typical interaction? Do you tend to go back and forth with it to refine things, or do you usually give it a task and then work with whatever it produces?

User: Proofreading is pretty much fire and forget - I don't even really see the "raw" submissions any more. Someone submits something, it's run through the API, and in my admin page I just see the cleaned up version, with a guide for how much has been changed as a percentage. If it's only a couple of characters I trust that was a good edit. If a lot is different I'll pull up the original and see why so much was changed, then tweak it myself.

Coding is more collaborative - I'll say what's needed or give it some existing code that needs to change, then go back and forth until we get to an end result that's what I want.

AI: That's a fascinating difference in how you approach those two use cases. You mentioned workplace culture earlier in passing - since you're running your own site, I'm curious how being your own boss affects the way you use AI. Do you think you approach it differently than you might in a more traditional workplace setting?

User: Hard to say for sure as I've always been self employed, so I've not got much to compare against! I suspect in a more formal setting AI would need more guardrails or approval. Being my own boss means I have complete control over what I use / don't use AI for. Nobody's skeptical about it where I'm trusting, or vice versa. I know what it's useful for in my specific use cases, and have used it enough that as and when I get the opportunity, I can tinker with it for different things. No doubt some workplaces are very casual with it and others are more restrictive, but I like the flexibility.

AI: That flexibility sounds like it's allowed you to really experiment and find your comfort zones. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Some coding situations, although I'm afraid off the top of my head I can't think of specifics. AI can sometimes get stuck into a loop where I'll ask for something, it gets the wrong end of the stick, and then won't get steered back on track.

Actually one has just occurred to me. Being a movie/TV site I need episode listings for TV shows. I've got an official API that often provides them, but not always. I've set up a link for any given show that generates a prompt I can paste into ChatGPT, basically "create a JSON of episodes for season X of TV show Y in this format..." For historical reasons my database schema uses "text" for the episode title instead of "title" ("title" is used in my database for the show ID instead). Despite the JSON schema being clearly specified to use "text", ChatGPT kept outputting the JSON with "title" instead, and just wouldn't do it properly. I ended up changing my back end code to rewrite the JSON so I could paste it in anyway. A minor frustration, and fixable, but it's that sort of thing that means I don't fully trust it for total automation.

AI: That's such a perfect example of how AI can be incredibly useful but still have those stubborn moments that require human oversight. You mentioned earlier that you think AI's reliability for judgment calls is improving. How do you think about maintaining your own skills in areas where AI could potentially take over more of the work?

User: It's a concern - my site's been my full time job for years, but is slowly waning in popularity with traffic falling, so a shift in jobs will be needed eventually. My coding isn't up to a "professional" standard, but oddly in the AI era that might not be a dreadful thing, because it means I've got a solid enough understanding of the foundations to hopefully work with AI in terms of it doing some coding and me understanding it, rather than having no real clue what it's doing. But then I'm not sure being a professional web developer is what I want to keep doing longer term anyway. 

My optimistic take is that working more and more with AI will mean I've got a better understanding of the sort of work it can do, but also what it can't do (yet). It's naive to think that AI won't end up having an impact, but it's still quite early days - I think it'll be more of a trickle than a flood. Relatively "simple" jobs could be done by AI, but hopefully competent people with transferrable skills will have a place for a while, just using AI as a tool. And when the time comes for job searching or upskilling I'm fairly sure I'll be using AI in that process too.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on the evolving landscape. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing much from how you use it now?

User: Not hugely, but likely it creeping in more and more. If/when a full site redesign happens, I'll certainly use AI for a lot of that, because even if I don't fully trust it for the complex things, I can get it to do a lot of the "grunt work", and then smooth off the rough edges. Similarly with moderation of submissions, while I'm not fully comfortable with fully automating that, there are elements that could be. Classifying the content, finding relevant cast info, maybe even scoring them somehow. There's a lot of potential for AI implementation. At some point I might try uploading my entire codebase into it and just seeing what it makes of it, getting suggestions, etc. That just hasn't been a priority yet. But that process might be informative in terms of getting ideas for things I could delegate to AI.

It's largely whether implementing automation would really end up saving me time/effort overall - for a lot of relatively tedious admin things, they're not too arduous, but re-coding things to automate them might take more time than just doing it manually! At the same time coding is much more interesting/educational than the boring admin stuff, so it's not just about pure time savings.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how trust and reliability guide your decisions about what to delegate, and your realistic but optimistic view of adapting to AI's evolving capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing that comes to mind.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining quality control and personal expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
