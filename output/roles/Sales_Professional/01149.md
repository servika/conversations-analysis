Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! No questions at this time.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a podcaster! I do many other things, like writing blog posts, scripting and recording meditations, and sometimes I create digital media that I sell... But first and foremost, I am a podcaster. I have been making pods for about 6 or 7 years. An average project for me is a large scale podcast episode, in which I'm formulating ideas, gathering notes, researching and mapping out the flow of the episode. Sometimes that takes over a month, depending on the topic.

AI: That's fascinating - the depth of preparation you put into each episode really comes through. A month of research and mapping for a single episode shows serious dedication to your craft.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I reach for AI tools a lot for the research side of things. Whereas I used to spend hours googling some obscure thing I remembered reading about years ago, AI tools can find the exact piece of content I read and the actual scientific study it comes from. I can cite loose ideas to a chatbot, recalling that I had read about them in this context or that. The chatbot will always find exactly what I'm looking for, and will pull from more reputable sources if I request for it to do so.  I also reach for AI when I have multiple strings of ideas, and I'm struggling with how to format the episode. I find it useful to help me reign myself into a cohesive structure, without losing my creativity in the process.  Additionally, I always ask AI to write my episode summaries (the ones that get attached to the episodes). I struggle to write my own summaries, so I just paste in my transcript and ask the AI to summarize it for me, using a specific tone, and keeping SEO and my ideal listener in mind.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI has become a powerful research assistant and structural thinking partner for you. I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about AI helping you create cohesive structure "without losing your creativity in the process."

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was working on a two part podcast and had a very messy notion page filled with random notes on the topic. Some notes were facts, personal opinions, quotes from famous people, my own stories or anecdotes, findings from articles or studies, etc. I explained to the AI (in a very long prompt) the main idea of the podcast episode, how I wanted the listener to feel and the tone I wanted to evoke. Then I copied and pasted all of my notes as asked it to make an outline WITHOUT altering any of my ideas. I stipulated that it could add suggestions that relate to the cohesiveness of the episode, but its main job was to re-order all of my concepts into a flow.

AI: That sounds like such a thoughtful collaboration - you maintained ownership of all your ideas while leveraging AI's organizational strengths. I'm curious about the outcome.

When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The outcome on that particular ep was great! It was about 2 hours worth of audio and a fan-favorite. I feel like I am in the driver's seat, only if I am constantly adding those kinds of limitations and stipulations. Otherwise, I feel like the AI takes off on its own and has a tendency to create things that sound a little more generic, lacking human touch.

AI: That's a really valuable distinction you're making - the importance of setting those boundaries and stipulations to maintain your creative voice. It sounds like you've developed a real skill in directing the AI while protecting what makes your work uniquely yours.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Research, outlining, planning, note-taking and social media style writing and sales copy are what have changed the most for me.

AI: Tell me more about that. How have those changes affected your overall creative process or the quality of your work?

User: They have changed my creative process in the sense that I have more time to BE creative. Instead of spending an hour cleaning up my messy notes and ideas, I can pop it into a chatbot that instantly cleans it for me. Instead of spending 20 minutes trying to write a short (but potent and SEO driven) podcast summary... I can just have it written instantly. The quality of my actual creative work has gone up because I'm not spending as much time or energy doing the finicky things that I didn't really like to begin with.

AI: That's a powerful insight - AI handling the tasks you found tedious has freed up your mental energy for the creative work you actually enjoy. It sounds like it's enhanced rather than replaced your creativity.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have concerns for people who are using it to fully write their essays, blogs, podcast episodes. I don't want human art and creativity to be lost. I think it's a fabulous tool, but we have to place limitations and give instructions when using AI. If you lean too heavily on it, I think it can actually be a creativity killer.

AI: That's such an important perspective - the distinction between AI as a tool versus a replacement. You seem to have found that sweet spot where it enhances your process without diminishing your creative voice.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'd like to see built-in meeting summary AIs get more accurate and nuanced, which I think it will. I think I will continue to use regular chatbots as a sort of "cleaner" for all my ideas that are consistently jumbled with loose threads and typos. I'd like to see AI get a bit better at understanding brand voice and tone after being instructed and trained on it. For example, I sometimes have to go back and forth with a bot to get an episode summary that sounds like my brand. Even though that writing is less important, it needs to be consistent in tone.

AI: Those are really thoughtful predictions, especially around AI better understanding and maintaining brand voice. It sounds like you're looking for more sophistication in areas where you already find AI helpful, rather than wanting it to take on entirely new creative roles.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how setting clear boundaries and limitations keeps you in the driver's seat, and how AI has freed up your energy for the creative work you actually love doing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think much of creative people's reluctance to use AI is because of the fear of losing the heart and soul of their art. As stated, I've found it to be a helpful admin assistant. If you are looking to attract more creatives into AI tools, that may be a useful angle for your marketing, which may include some education on prompting and placing instruction and limitation on a bot!

AI: That's an incredibly valuable insight - framing AI as an "admin assistant" rather than a creative collaborator could really resonate with other creative professionals who share those concerns about preserving the heart and soul of their work. And your point about education around prompting and setting limitations is spot-on - it sounds like those skills are crucial for maintaining creative control.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's efficiency while protecting your creative voice will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating these tools into your workflow.
