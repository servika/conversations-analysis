Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was working on a life science project in which I aim to develop a therapeutic approach to treat a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a loss-of-function gene mutation. The project was derived from previous identifications of a cohort of patients which exhibit autism-like symptoms and possess a common gene mutation.

AI: That sounds like really important work. Tell me more about how that project unfolded - what were the key steps you went through from having that cohort of patients with the common gene mutation to developing your therapeutic approach?

User: We did exosome sequencing using their skin tissue samples and we found they all had mutation on the same gene which regulates splicing. And we used iPSCs derived from the patients as a disease model and we found the neurogenic differentiation is impaired. Then we developed anti-sense oligo to target mutated transcripts aiming to eliminate the disease-causing mutated mRNA.

AI: That's fascinating - you've taken this from patient samples all the way through to developing a potential therapeutic intervention. That's quite a comprehensive process involving sequencing, cellular modeling, and then therapeutic development.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I mainly used AI tools to troubleshoot experimental problems. And I also used AI to help me gather information on past research.

AI: Tell me more about the troubleshooting part - what kinds of experimental problems were you running into, and how did AI help you work through those?

User: The problems include bad PCR result, Western blot result not correct, ASO design, etc

AI: That's really helpful to understand. Let me focus on one of those - when you had issues with your ASO design, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach to solve that problem.

User: I consulted AI to understand how to design an ASO. Traditionally, I need to consult expert in this field but I have limited access to them. But AI can help me and can provide sources that can back up its reasoning.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - AI giving you access to expertise when the human experts aren't readily available. When AI provided you with that ASO design guidance and those sources, how did you go about verifying or validating what it gave you before moving forward with your experiments?

User: I asked AI to show where did it get the rules it presented using real papers. I looked up the method sections and verified myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful verification approach. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm curious about the flip side - thinking about the other parts of your research process like the exosome sequencing, the iPSC work, or the differentiation analysis, what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: AI tool is bad at analysing long nucleic acid sequence. It hallucinates a lot when long DNA or RNA sequence is involved.

AI: That's a really important limitation you've identified. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether that's the sequence analysis you mentioned or something else entirely - what would that be and why?

User: I wish it could help me analyse NGS sequencing dataset like this: I upload the fastq raw data to the model and ask it to do read mapping, data analysis and it will do that. Currently, we need to rely on bioinformatician's help with this type of analysis and it's really time consuming and requires much effort in communication. I wish AI can help me analyse these datasets.

AI: That would be incredibly valuable - having AI handle that entire NGS analysis pipeline from raw data to results without needing to coordinate with bioinformaticians. The time and communication bottleneck you described sounds like a real pain point.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on using AI as an accessible expert when human expertise isn't available, and your careful approach to verification through checking primary sources, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI serving as a bridge to expertise when specialists aren't accessible, and especially your point about the sequence analysis limitations, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The contrast between where AI works well for you - like troubleshooting and information gathering - versus where it falls short - like handling long sequences - gives us a much clearer picture of the current landscape.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
