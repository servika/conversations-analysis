Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, that sounds good and I am ready to begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently conducted a study predicting future direct operating costs for an all electric aircraft in commercial aviation. Since this was a purely conceptual research project, no experiments could be conducted, and extensive research was necessary. I created a cost model on Excel, using a number of assumptions and assessed the impact of varying these assumptions. Concluding my research by writing a complete paper about my findings.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - predicting costs for technology that's still emerging must have involved quite a bit of research and modeling work.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: AI assisted heavily in finding estimates for prices, such as engine prices, since it could scan a number of research papers for figures much faster than I could manually.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to scan through research papers for specific data points like engine prices sounds like it could save a lot of time.

For that literature scanning task, tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of manually searching through papers.

User: I would use AI for much of the original research, making sure to ask for sources for its information, then I would double check these sources to make sure that they were valid and correct. Additionally, if I had found a figure through traditional methods, occasionally I may ask AI to validate my own research.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI for the initial sweep and then verifying the sources yourself. It sounds like you've developed a system that combines the speed of AI with your own validation process.

Thinking about the other parts of your research - like building the Excel cost model or writing the final paper - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I used AI heavily when writing the paper, I would write each paragraph initially in semi-note form, then ask AI to rewrite this for a professional report. This saved a lot of time in the report writing process. I would then read the AI paragraph and rephrase where needed. For the Excel cost model, I found that AI did not create a very reliable model. The cost model I made was very clearly formatted and made changing variables simple and visible.

AI: So it sounds like you actually used AI quite extensively - for literature research, validating your findings, and drafting the paper. But when it came to the Excel modeling, you found AI wasn't reliable enough for that specific task.

When you've used AI for writing those paragraph drafts, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What do you look for when you're deciding whether to keep the AI's version or rephrase it?

User: I would almost always rephrase it, keeping only small combinations of words, AI was mostly used here to keep variety in the wording used.

AI: That's a really nuanced way of using AI - essentially as a writing assistant to help with variety and flow rather than relying on its content directly. It sounds like you've developed quite a sophisticated approach across different parts of your research process.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: To be honest, I enjoy the process of conducting the research myself, and wouldn't want AI to complete most of the tasks involved completely. If AI could work on producing accurate graphs from my data and formatting these to align with a paper, this would probably be the most helpful tool I can think of.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - you value the actual research process itself and want to maintain control over the core work, but you'd appreciate AI handling more of the technical formatting tasks like graph production.

This brings up something interesting about your overall experience. From what you've shared, it sounds like you've found a balance where AI supports your work without replacing your expertise or judgment. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so, at the moment I wouldn't trust AI to fully complete any tasks without needed to double check them.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about using AI as a research assistant while maintaining your own oversight and validation - rather than trusting it to complete tasks independently - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

Your approach of leveraging AI's speed for literature scanning and writing variety, while keeping the critical thinking and model building firmly in your own hands, shows a very thoughtful integration that preserves the integrity of your research process.

This has been incredibly valuable for our understanding of how scientists are navigating AI integration. Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! It was a pleasure speaking with you about your research. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
