Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in the film industry as a producer and generally see AI being used in a few ways. 

1.) It's being used a lot in the script development phase as the initial coverage report on a project. The scripts still go to human readers, but our company has a series of detailed prompts asking AI to breakdown a script, talk about its marketable aspects, and compare it to other films in the marketplace. 

2.) Script breakdown and budgeting. This is still coming along because there are so many nuances to breaking down a script, scheduling production, and budgeting. It seems there are nearly endless variables involved to make a project go. However, it all begins with a script breakdown, which involves tagging the different script elements as the starting point (i.e. characters, locations, props, wardrobe, etc. all get color-coded tags and then an overall report to help the schedulers and budgeters.) AI is fairly good at this, thought it does still miss some nuances, such as counting characters as two different cast members if the script uses a nickname or a full name followed by first name only, for example. So human oversight is still necessary...but AI breakdowns are a great time-saving starting point. There is a recent tool we're trying out that then takes the breakdown and moves it into scheduling and then budgeting. I am skeptical that AI can do this as well as a human with years in the industry...but I'm excited to experiment with it.

AI: That's fascinating - you're seeing AI being integrated at some really foundational stages of film production. The script coverage and breakdown work sounds like it's already providing real value as a starting point.

Tell me more about that human oversight piece you mentioned with the script breakdowns. When you're reviewing what the AI has produced, what's your process like? Are you going through it line by line, or do you find there are certain types of errors you've learned to look for?

User: It really depends. Usually by the time you're breaking down a script for production a lot of development work has been done -- there's been several table reads, lots of revisions and new drafts...so you're fairly familiar with the screenplay...so you don't necessarily have to go line-by-line. 

Also, some of the errors are really obvious. For instance, if you look at the scene report and AI has listed "Robert" "Bob Smith" and "Bob" as three different characters, you can fairly quickly combine those tags into one character.

AI: That makes sense - your familiarity with the script from the development process gives you a good foundation to spot those obvious inconsistencies quickly.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Well, I came into the industry as a writer first before moving to producer. I still like to write from time to time and prefer to do that myself. 

As AI gets more accurate with the data and details of producing, I imagine I will rely on it more -- the part of producing I love is the networking with financiers, negotiating with vendors, and negotiating with / hiring cast and crew...those are all things that need the human touch for sure. I like the numbers piece of it, too -- but am perfectly happy to let AI take the first run at breakdowns, scheduling, budgeting, categorizing transactions, etc.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - you're drawn to the relationship and negotiation aspects that require that human connection, while you're comfortable letting AI handle the more data-driven foundational work.

When you use AI for those tasks like breakdowns or budgeting, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to delegate the complete task for it to handle independently and then review the results?

User: Well, the new tool that we're testing out sort of has a pre-built workflow. 

We upload a PDF of the shooting script and the AI tool comes back with a breakdown (i.e. tags for each scene, scene reports, and final reports for the entire screenplay.) 

We have to review this before we can move onto scheduling -- once we've reviewed / confirmed all tags, then we can ask it to do a stripboard (this is a specific kind of schedule used in film). Then we review that and only after we've reviewed / edited / confirmed the schedule can we ask it to develop a budget.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like the tool enforces a very structured, stage-gate approach where each phase needs your approval before moving to the next. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are you finding that everyone's on board with these tools, or is there variation in how people feel about incorporating them?

User: It's in very early stages so I'm not sure yet. In general, I think it will be a welcome addition to the workflow because tagging script elements and creating a stripboard are two of the most time-consuming parts of getting the script to the point where it can be budgeted (a film budget is mostly a matter of number of cast/crew times number of days -- again, there's a lot more nuance than that, but that's a solid first step...so having the script breakdown and  shooting schedule is an absolute prerequisite to budgeting.)

AI: That makes sense - if it can significantly speed up those prerequisite steps, it sounds like it could have a real impact on getting projects moving faster.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure -- I actually recently got a hold of a prompt sequence being used by some of the big studios to evaluate screenplays for development / production / distribution -- i.e. they put screenplays through this prompt series in order to help decide what to invest in or what to pick up for distribution. This was shared with me by a friend who works at one of these big studios. 

I put a screenplay that I recently produced (a small indie film) through this same prompt series just to see how it stacks up. The AI model made some great comparisons for the film and reviewed it incredibly favorably -- obviously this made me happy because we are about to go out to buyers for the film for distribution, and I know that if they are using this as part of the decision-making process we have a good shot! 

Also, though, it was nice to see my gut instinct about the quality of the project be validated -- not even so much by the AI but by the prompts that the big industry players created to guide their own investment decisions.

AI: That's such a satisfying validation on multiple levels - both affirming your creative instincts and giving you insight into how the bigger players are evaluating projects. It sounds like getting that behind-the-scenes look at the studio evaluation process was almost as valuable as the positive assessment itself.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes and, honestly, because I'm a little older now I definitely worry about my ability to keep up. Film has always changed every 10 years or so (if not more frequently) and has always been on the leading edge of technological innovation...so "adapt or die" has always been built into the DNA of film workers...but this feels a little more overwhelming than previous innovations such as DVDs, streaming, VFX, etc. 

I'm fortunate that I'm high enough up that I can hire people to do the things I don't want to do or to help figure this stuff out -- but it's still definitely a concern. 

The even bigger concern, though, is how AI will impact audience behavior. Without an audience, film goes away no matter how well you're able to keep up.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're not just thinking about the production side but the fundamental question of how AI might change what audiences want or expect from entertainment.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally in your role as a producer?

User: Since dwindling audiences are the biggest concern, I'm really interested in exploring more about what AI can do to help build audience and repurpose films. I've seen tools recently that will pull Reels / clips from long-form video content such as films or even recut a film as a vertical series -- there could be a way to use AI tools like this to maintain audience and create additional revenue streams from existing projects.

AI: That's a really forward-thinking approach - using AI not just for production efficiency but to actively solve the audience engagement challenge by creating new formats and touchpoints with your content.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the industry's history of technological adaptation is helping you navigate this change, even though AI feels more overwhelming than previous shifts.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so. I've been a little slow to adapt and bring AI in, so these are just the first few areas where I'm seeing a use for these tools in my work.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI is being integrated at those foundational stages of film production - from script coverage to breakdowns to budgeting - and especially your perspective on balancing efficiency gains with maintaining the human elements you value most, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you're approaching this transition thoughtfully, even while feeling some of the pressures that come with technological change in your industry.
