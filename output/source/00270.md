Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, all good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a full time athlete in the sport of sailing. I sail the ILCA 6. I use AI to assist with my administrative work, such as creating schedules and training plans, budgeting, expense reporting, regatta reports, sport science and nutrition advice, researching weather conditions, and travel planning for training camps and competitions away from home

AI: That's a fascinating range of applications! It sounds like you're using AI to handle quite a bit of the behind-the-scenes work that supports your sailing career.

Tell me more about how you use AI for creating your training plans. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: I usually use AI to create a starting point. I might upload a debrief report from a recent regatta which includes my thoughts about my strengths, weaknesses, and any other notable ideas that came up. I'd then tell AI what my next event is and ask it to create a full on and off water training schedule

AI: That's really interesting - using your own regatta debriefs as input to shape future training. 

When AI creates that training schedule for you, what happens next? Do you typically take what it gives you and run with it, or do you find yourself going back and forth with it to refine the plan?

User: I usually go back and forth. Sometimes the suggestions don't make any sense practically and I have to ask the model to adjust. Or sometimes I want to spend extra time focusing on a specific area / skill

AI: That back-and-forth dynamic sounds like a real collaboration. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: A lot of the work I do can't be done by AI. That's the actual physical work. Some other work I prefer to do on my own are debrief reports from a training day or regatta. It's important to me that all these reports are my own thoughts. It's also an important part of the learning process for me to actually critically think about the day and process what happened

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the debrief reports being your own thoughts and part of your learning process. It sounds like there's something valuable about doing that reflection work yourself.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Always collaborate through a task. It's important for me to feel like I actually did the task with help. I don't like letting AI completely do my work

AI: That's a really clear distinction - wanting to feel like you actually did the work with help rather than having it done for you.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? I'm thinking about other athletes, coaches, or people in your sailing community.

User: Not really. I don't know if it's largely used publicly. Many athletes have managers that do this work for them, and maybe they use AI. I've seen some other athletes use AI to brainstorm fundraising ideas

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time that made me frustrated, although I found it a bit funny, was when I was trying to use AI to help create a sponsorship package. I uploaded many samples with multiple pages and visuals, and gave lots of input about my ideas and my vision. The ai had previously used visuals / graphic design so I expected similar work. The ai model spent over half an hour generating a sponsorship package and when it was finally done, all it outputted was a single PDF page of black and white text with some bullet points from my previous samples

AI: That does sound frustrating - especially after half an hour and with all that input you provided! It's almost like it completely missed what you were looking for.

What about on the flip side - can you think of a time when using AI made you feel particularly satisfied with the outcome?

User: AI has made some good, detailed daily and weekly training plans for me that need minimal adjustment. Really helps take the mental load off so I can just focus on going out and training

AI: That's a great example of AI really hitting the mark - taking that mental planning load off so you can focus on what matters most.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. My role as an athlete is to perform on the water. Most of the work I get AI to do for me are areas where many other athletes have managers. AI takes over the tasks I consider a nuisance and would usually be delegated to another person entirely

AI: That's a really practical way to think about it - AI handling the tasks that would typically go to a manager anyway.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'd hope AI is able to create better visuals and graphic designs. Securing sponsorships is a major part of the work as an athlete. If AI can competently take over this area, I'd probably do more delegation rather than complete collaboration

AI: That makes sense - better visual capabilities could really change how you approach sponsorship work, which sounds like a significant part of what you need to do.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to feel like you actually did the work with help rather than having it completely done for you - that distinction between collaboration and delegation seems really important to how you think about using AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No all good

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an athlete - especially how you think about collaboration versus delegation, and the importance of keeping ownership over your own reflective work - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with your training and upcoming competitions!

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and thanks again for participating in our research.
