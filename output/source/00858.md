Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, seems pretty straight forward! Let's go ahead and start

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a sales consultant at a car dealership! I mainly use AI to create descriptions for Facebook Marketplace posts and also to create general social media posts. The CRM we use at are dealership also has integrated AI that helps follow up with leads and schedule appointments.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is touching several different parts of your sales process. 

When you're creating those Facebook Marketplace descriptions, what does that process typically look like for you? Are you starting from scratch with the AI, or do you have certain information you always provide to get the descriptions you want?

User: I always provide the Make, model, trim level, and mileage of the vehicle I am posting. I also give some form of price to include, either an estimated monthly payment or a total price.

AI: That makes sense - you've got a pretty consistent template with those key details. 

Tell me more about how you actually work with the AI when creating those descriptions. Do you typically take what it gives you and post it as-is, or do you find yourself editing and tweaking the output before it goes live?

User: I will typically trim out "salesy" filler material in the provided descriptions. The benefit of the AI is the ability to create quick list of options a specific vehicle might have, without having to research myself.

AI: That's a really practical use - having the AI handle the research on vehicle features while you focus on crafting the right tone. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I am not a fan of the way the AI within our CRM reaches out to customers. It forces everyday contact, even with little engagement from the customers. A lot of the correspondence comes off as verbose and rigid. It definitely does not read like a real person is crafting the messages.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're making. So you're comfortable having AI help with the marketplace descriptions where you can edit and control the final output, but the automated customer outreach feels too impersonal for your style.

When you do handle customer communications yourself instead of using the CRM's AI, what approach do you take? How would you describe your personal communication style with potential buyers?

User: I have fairly persistent follow-up, but in most cases, I leave it to be every other day. I also try to keep my outreach sounding conversational. I would rather come across as an individual reaching out in a friendly and humble way, rather than a robot reaching out that is backed by a fairly large business. The verbose and "salesy" content is just impersonal and really highlights that they are being contacted by a business that is trying to make money

AI: That really highlights an important difference - you're choosing to maintain that personal, human touch in direct customer relationships while letting AI handle the more informational tasks.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will give tweaks (successive prompts) when crafting Marketplace Descriptions. ChatGPT has pretty much refined this task into one that I do not have to augment much anymore after the initial response. The CRM AI does not really have a way of collaborating.

AI: So it sounds like you've developed a collaborative flow with ChatGPT over time - almost like you've trained each other to work together effectively on those marketplace descriptions. That's quite different from the CRM AI which just does its own thing.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at the dealership approach it similarly to how you do?

User: I would say that colleagues have influenced me to post more on Facebook for lead generation, but they haven't influenced my choice to incorporate AI into this process. The CRM and "AI Genus" attached are something we are forced to use by our corporate leadership; they do encourage us to make the most of the AI component of this software.

AI: So there's this interesting mix - your colleagues pushing you toward more Facebook posting, but you independently discovered AI as a way to make that more efficient. Meanwhile, corporate is mandating the CRM AI use.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The automatic outreach and response in the CRM we use has confused a customer to the point where they have cancelled a scheduled appointment. This particular customer was asking a specific question about financing, and the AI kept ignoring and just reiterating that the dealership has many financing options available.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you're trying to build relationships and close sales, and the AI is actually driving customers away by not listening to what they're asking.

How did you handle that situation after the customer cancelled? Did you try to reach out personally, or was the relationship too damaged at that point?

User: I tried to call and reschedule the appointment, but the customer never picked up after that.

AI: That must have been really disappointing - losing a potential sale because the AI couldn't handle a straightforward financing question properly.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, this is a concern I do face, especially with the emergence of online car sales sites like Carvana. I believe AI will eventually have a large share of the car sales job market, and people will drift away from the personal touch sales experience.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the bigger picture changes happening in your industry. It sounds like you see both the immediate AI tools you're using now and the broader shift toward online sales as potential challenges.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll find ways to use it more effectively, or are you more focused on developing skills that AI can't replicate?

User: Right now, my focus is on developing that personability through the sales process. This is something AI can not help with. I do believe it will eventually mature to a point where it can help "in-person" sales professionals with lead generation/follow-up, but right now, I feel like that stuff is better done myself.

AI: That's a really strategic approach - doubling down on the human connection aspect that you clearly see as your competitive advantage.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've found that sweet spot using AI for research and content creation while keeping the personal touch in your customer relationships.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that AI developers who are integrating chat models to interact with customers should allow for back-and-forth communication with the sales professional who is utilizing the AI as well. As I can train ChatGPT to create a consistent Marketplace description, the sales professional should be able to train the AI in the CRM with their own personal touch. That is all!

AI: That's a fantastic insight - the idea of being able to train the CRM AI with your own communication style, just like you've done with ChatGPT for those marketplace descriptions. That could really solve that tension between efficiency and maintaining your personal approach with customers.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with that personal touch in sales will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me today!
