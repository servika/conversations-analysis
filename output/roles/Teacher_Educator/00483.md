Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, I am ready to go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do not use AI every day, but when I do it is typically to help structure lessons for units or to brainstorm ideas about different kinds of lessons I could do to help my students learn, or strengthen their knowledge in, an academic concept. I have also used it to help me find specific Common Core standards and create lessons based on those standards. Occasionally, I have used it to create math or reading problems when I am lacking a bit of creativity.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you're an educator using AI as more of a specialized tool rather than something that's part of your daily routine.

When you do turn to AI for lesson planning or brainstorming, what prompts you to reach for it in those moments? What's usually happening that makes you think "this is a good time to use AI"?

User: My use of AI is typically prompted by my busy schedule. I have only so many minutes in my work day when students are not around, so having AI do a bit of a double check on things has been helpful. When it comes to brainstorming it comes from moments where I see my students struggling to grasp a concept, so it is like asking for a second opinion. Typically I would ask my colleagues for help, since many of them have been teaching longer than I have, but I know they are just as busy as I am, so AI kind of helps to fill that gap. I try not to use AI to create assessments or homework for my students,  just because I expect them not to use AI in the classroom. But I will occasionally use it for a minor class reading or math worksheet.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI almost like a virtual colleague when your human colleagues aren't available due to everyone's busy schedules. 

You mentioned you try not to use AI for assessments or homework because you expect students not to use AI in the classroom. Can you tell me more about how you think about that balance? What guides your decisions about where the line is between appropriate and inappropriate AI use in your teaching?

User: Well, for assessments, I typically want to be fully in control and knowledgeable about what my students are looking at on a test.  I also typically use curriculum materials for the test, so using AI really isn't much of a choice anyway. When I have created homework, I often take problems from the workbook we use in class so my students can practice with examples that they have struggled with before. I think the line is a bit blurry at times because I truly wish I did not have to use AI at all, but with the amount of behaviors and students who are falling behind academically, I do not always have time to create amazing things like teachers in the past have. I try to avoid using it when I know I have the ability to create the thing on my own in the allotted time.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - it sounds like there's some tension between your ideal teaching practice and the realities of your current workload and student needs.

When you say you wish you didn't have to use AI at all, what drives that feeling? What would your ideal scenario look like if time and resources weren't constraints?

User: I think that using AI is not inherently bad, however, I expect my students to show me their own work 100

AI: It sounds like there was more you wanted to say there - you mentioned expecting your students to show their own work 100... could you finish that thought?

User: 100% of the time, so it does not seem quite fair for me to only use my own work 80-90% of the time. If time and resources were not a constraint, I would spend all of my time collaborating with my collogues, tackling the issues that we are seeing with our students together. I love to share ideas with people who understand and gain insights from teachers who have been teaching for years. There are so many good ideas and teaching is all about learning from experience, but the lack of time I have in my day, paired with the amount  I have to get done, really cuts into the time I have to collaborate with other teachers.

AI: That really highlights an interesting parallel - you want to model the same standards for yourself that you set for your students. 

You mentioned that ideally you'd spend more time collaborating with colleagues who have years of experience and can share insights from that experience. When you do use AI instead of being able to collaborate with those experienced teachers, how does that feel different? What do you get from human collaboration that AI can't provide?

User: AI has never been in a classroom and lacks the emotional knowledge that a teacher, or real human in general, has. Sometimes I will see a student's academic performance or behavior change and asking my colleague about it, they can give me real-life anecdotes about students they have had that have shown similar behaviors. From there, they can help me brainstorm ways to help the student. There is also insight that my colleagues have about students who have older siblings that they have taught before. Like a few years ago, a teacher I was working with  had a student that I had been a counselor for at a summer camp. Whenever she was in tough spot with that student, I was able to give her some insight into how mom is with the student at home, which really helped give the teacher perspective. And the same has happened to me, where I have talked to teachers who have explained that mom or dad at home expected their former student to act a certain way, and my student who was that student's brother, was showing similar behaviors. Same with collaborating with past teachers, I teach third grade and I have gone and asked first and second grade teachers many many questions about students I am struggling with. The human interaction of hearing what other teachers have experienced and feeling seen and understood by them is something AI could never replace.

AI: That's such a rich description of the kind of contextual, relationship-based knowledge that comes from human experience and connection. It sounds like those conversations with colleagues aren't just about getting information, but also about feeling supported and understood in your work.

When you do use AI for brainstorming instead of having those colleague conversations, how do you typically interact with it? Do you find yourself going back and forth with AI throughout the process, or do you more often ask it to generate something complete that you can then work with?

User: I typically just give it the prompt and have it generate the response. If the response is not exactly what I am looking for, I will provide extra detail and feedback so it can try again to achieve my desired outcome. I do not typically chat with AI like they are a real person, I use it like it is a too to help me out. I of course say please and thank you, because I know they learn from interaction and I think its important for everything, even AI, to have manners.

AI: That's interesting - you have this very purposeful, tool-like approach to AI while still maintaining politeness. The "please and thank you" detail is really thoughtful.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't think I have ever felt necessarily 'frustrated', but there have been times where I have asked for more complex ideas and the AI has only partially delivered on them. Like I have asked for math ccss for 2nd-4th grade that are related to concepts of multiplication and some multiplication problems that can be paired with those ccss for different levels, and the AI brought up only 3rd and 4th grade standards because technically 2nd doesn't have any direct multiplication standards, but they do have many addition ones that directly relate to multiplication. As for satisfaction, I have had several moments when I ask for short stories to help my students practice fluently reading and the AI has been able to really create some interesting and engaging stories.

AI: That multiplication standards example really shows how AI can miss those nuanced connections that an experienced educator would catch - like how 2nd grade addition standards connect to multiplication concepts.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do not think AI will take over in education, at least I hope it won't. I think that it is important to stay up to date with new technology because I am sure that sometime down the line schools will adopt AI in some form and I do not want to be the teacher who fumbles around with it and has to have my students help me. For right now, I am sticking with general LLM use and making sure I am highly aware and critical of anything AI produces for me.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I don't know how AI in education can really evolve. Education is so human and requires so much nuance related to the human experience. Teachers always say that 'one size does not fit all' in education and that is very true. I have not been teaching for long, but every experience I have had in the classroom is always different and keeps me guessing. AI is built to recognize patterns, but in education patterns don't really exist. I could see AI maybe helping more in the lesson planning and material creation aspect, but beyond that, I do not think that AI can replace the human-ness of education.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can't replace the contextual, relationship-based knowledge that comes from collaborating with experienced colleagues, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining professional standards while navigating practical constraints.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a practical tool while maintaining your professional values, and especially your thoughts on the irreplaceable human elements of teaching, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how honest you were about the tensions between ideal practice and real-world constraints - that kind of authentic perspective is exactly what helps us understand how AI is actually being integrated into people's work lives.

Have a great rest of your day!
