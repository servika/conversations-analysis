Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. I don't have any questions at this time.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI for writing code for crypto related purposes. Mainly running my own bots to do very low risk low reward transactions across varying blockchains. I currently am incapable of writing such code, and at the time it seems practical to use A.I. to collaborate with and help write the code.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to help build crypto trading bots across different blockchains. It sounds like you're venturing into territory that's technically beyond your current coding skills.

When you say you "collaborate" with AI to write this code, can you walk me through what that actually looks like in practice? How do you and the AI work together on these bot projects?

User: Typically there is quite a bit of information I would need to get these up and running. For example, ticker info and details via api access that needs to be found and AI up until this moment has not been able to find this type of information for me. I usually have to dig quite a bit to find reliable info and that sometimes requires me to check areas like discord, telegram, and twitter/X to find the relevant info. But at least while I am doing that I can ask the AI to help generate code specific to my current needs and venues so it cuts a significant portion of time off for me even if I knew how to properly code.

AI: So you're doing the detective work to track down the specific API details and ticker information from these various social channels, while AI handles the actual code generation once you feed it those details.

Tell me more about that research process you do on Discord, Telegram, and Twitter. What makes finding that information so challenging that AI can't help with that part?

User: The AI i just not able at the moment to either gain access to a specific discord or telegram channel or even send a DM to a party that would have that information.

AI: Ah, I see - it's those access limitations that create the boundary between what you handle versus what AI can do for you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on these projects. Are there certain aspects of this work that you prefer to handle yourself, even beyond just the information gathering? What makes those parts feel like they should stay in your hands?

User: My preference is usually to at least have some grasp of why the code is written for that reason and if not I double check that performing a specific function within the code is safe. I want that to stay in my hands so I don't lose my money.

AI: That makes complete sense - you want to maintain control over the safety and logic aspects, especially when real money is at stake.

When you're working on these bot projects, could you describe your typical interaction pattern with AI? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the coding process, or do you tend to give it complete sections to handle independently once you've gathered the necessary information?

User: brainstorming typically will have a lot of back and forth until I finally tweak it enough to produce the output I'm looking for. Although I will say the recommendations AI make are quite good in these areas.

AI: That back-and-forth brainstorming process sounds pretty collaborative. It's interesting that you find AI's recommendations particularly strong in this area.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI for these crypto projects? Or is this more of a solo endeavor where workplace dynamics don't really factor in?

User: I would say for sure because AI and crypto became such duo early on before non-crypto natives started using AI on a regular basis. Seeing that wave really got me interested in starting to use AI to help me.

AI: So the crypto community was kind of an early adopter space where you saw AI being used effectively, and that influenced you to start experimenting with it yourself.

Can you share a time when using AI for these crypto bot projects made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It can be frustrating when I have a specific idea in my head that is sometimes a bit to hard to articulate to the AI or difficult to explain due to my limited coding knowledge. At times it feels like I could be asking better questions or making better remarks to each response to get things moving along better. But otherwise I think at this point in time AI has surpassed my expectations on these types of tasks.

AI: That communication challenge really resonates - when you have a clear vision but struggle to translate it into terms the AI can work with effectively. It sounds like there's this gap between your conceptual understanding and your technical vocabulary.

How do you think about maintaining your own coding skills in areas where AI is doing so much of the heavy lifting? Is developing those technical skills something you actively consider, or are you more focused on other aspects?

User: I do consider it and at times take small steps into understanding that side of things. But my focus lays in other areas for sure, and that is more for fun when I have the time to learn some code specific stuff.

AI: That's a practical approach - keeping coding as more of a side interest while AI handles the heavy lifting for your main projects.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI evolving in this work? Do you see yourself moving toward more independence, or deeper collaboration, or something else entirely?

User: I'd say more independence for sure as AI can start doing some of the heavy lifting for me as long as I can somewhat conceptualized the final product. I think getting from point A to point B will now become a lot more efficient.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience using AI for crypto bot development. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you maintain oversight for safety reasons while leveraging AI's strengths in code generation, and how the crypto community's early adoption influenced your own journey with AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience working with AI on these projects that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your story?

User: No.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating the technical challenges of crypto bot development while maintaining financial safety, and how you balance collaboration with AI against building your own understanding, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
