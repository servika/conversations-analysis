Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm an independent author. A typical project involves several stages including brainstorming plot and character ideas, researching details, drafting and editing the novel, brainstorming and writing titles and blurbs, and creating marketing copy and graphics for social media and ads.

AI: That's a comprehensive process with so many different creative elements. It sounds like you're handling everything from the initial creative spark all the way through to marketing.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I sometimes use AI to help brainstorm through plot holes or details like character names. I never use it to draft the novel, but I do have AI software specifically for editing. I have recently stated using AI to help me brainstorm title ideas and help create a base draft for my blurbs and loglines.

AI: That's really interesting how you've drawn those lines - using AI for brainstorming and editing support, but keeping the actual novel drafting to yourself. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I'm currently drafting a novel and have used it to help brainstorm plot ideas when I got stuck in the middle of the draft. I didn't use most of the ideas it came up with, but the "wrong" ideas sparked the right ones. I recently used AI after drafting the novel to come up with a blurb and title ideas. It was the same kind of situation where I didn't use the ideas exactly, but it served as a launch pad for my own ideas. Using AI for that part really helped save me a lot of time.

AI: That's a fascinating way to use AI - as a creative catalyst rather than for direct output. It sounds like the "wrong" ideas were actually quite valuable in sparking your own thinking.

When you're working with AI in these brainstorming sessions, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm always in control of the creative decisions.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does being in control of the creative decisions look like in practice when you're bouncing ideas back and forth with AI?

User: So for the most recent use with blurb writing, I fed the AI details about my novel and asked it to write a blurb in a particular style. Then I asked it to rewrite the blurb a couple of different ways. Finally, I pieced together ideas from the different versions and slightly reworded it in my own voice.

AI: That's a really clear example of how you maintain creative control while leveraging AI's capabilities. It sounds like you're using it as a starting point generator and then doing the actual creative synthesis yourself.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The back end of the process (the packaging and marketing) is stronger and takes much less time now. And I rely on the AI editing software a lot for line editing and proofreading.

AI: That sounds like AI has really streamlined some of the more time-intensive parts of your work. You mentioned the "back end" getting stronger - can you tell me more about what that improvement looks like for you?

User: For example, my blurb writing is more concise and seems to flow better.

AI: That's a concrete improvement. It sounds like AI is helping you develop skills in areas that might not be your primary creative strengths.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I definitely have concerns about people utilizing AI for drafting entire novels for them.

AI: Tell me more about that concern. What worries you specifically about people using AI to draft entire novels?

User: I have concerns about losing the human touch in the arts.

AI: That's a really important point. When you think about the "human touch" in your own work, what does that mean to you? What makes it distinctly human?

User: Every human author has a unique voice and point of view that comes through in a novel.

AI: That's a powerful way to think about it - that unique voice and perspective being something distinctly human that comes through the work.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see myself utilizing AI more in writing ad copy and probably more in research.

AI: Those are interesting areas of expansion. What draws you to using AI more for research in particular?

User: I think the capabilities of AI to synthesize a lot of information in easily digestible portions is very helpful.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that synthesis capability for research could be incredibly valuable.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated how you've carved out clear boundaries - using AI as a creative catalyst and for efficiency gains while keeping your unique voice and perspective at the center of your actual storytelling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while strategically leveraging AI for brainstorming and efficiency - and your thoughtful approach to preserving the human voice in storytelling - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
