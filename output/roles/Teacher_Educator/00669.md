Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good to me. Let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a primary supply teacher and an EFL teacher in the UK. I would say that the primary use of AI for me in my working life is creating ideas for specific curriculum or target language points. I'll also use it for creating base lesson plans (only for EFL teaching in this case), which I'll then adapt and personalise to my students' needs. Typically, I'll only make use of LLM during PPA time, though it could be handy to provide quick answers to any student questions that I'm unsure about - for example, if a student asks for some examples of how to use a grammar point, LLM will be able to create lots of examples much quicker than I could.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like AI serves different purposes across your teaching roles. 

When you mention creating "base lesson plans" for EFL that you then adapt and personalize, could you walk me through what that process actually looks like? How much of the original AI-generated plan typically remains after you've made it your own?

User: I'll feed the LLM the target language, the age range of the students and the general ability level then I'll give it a time frame and activities that I have locked in, then ask it to turn this raw information into a structured lesson plan with segments timed out and any gaps in the lesson filled in with suggested activities that fit the TL effectively. We'll probably bounce back and forth for a few turns fine tuning elements (taking activities out, changing them around etc.) then I'll take it away and get everything set so that I'm happy with it. This typically involves redoing the timings - I know my students and my teaching style and how long each bit SHOULD take, while the LLM is just "guestimating". In a typical lesson plan, probably about 50-60% of the AI-generated plan remains - that'll likely be the set in stone elements like intro, drilling, plenary and one or two of the activities. The stuff that gets cut will likely be activity suggestions that I feel won't work for me or my students.

AI: That back-and-forth refinement process you describe is fascinating - it sounds like a real collaboration rather than just getting something and walking away with it.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned there are activities the AI suggests that "won't work for me or my students." Are there certain aspects of lesson planning or teaching tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those different for you?

User: If I'm in a hurry then the back and forth interaction might not happen, but usually I'm pretty organised and it definitely speeds up the process when working with LLM. As for elements that I prefer to handle myself, there are, yes. As I mentioned, the timing of the lesson is usually best left to me - I've been teaching long enough now that I know how long things will take to set up, demonstrate, have the students go through, then sum up. Deciding on best activities for a certain language point is another thing I typically prefer to keep to myself - like I said, I know what sort of teacher I am and what I can pull off convincingly. An LLM might suggest doing something that doesn't really gel with my personality or perhaps even something I've tried with a class before and noticed that it fell flat. Seeing as LLM, as far as I know, don't build and retain a profile of their users, these little personalisation touches are best left to me. LLM are great for scaffolding the lesson, then I come in and put personalised meat on the bones, so to speak.

AI: That's a really vivid way to put it - "scaffolding the lesson" then adding the "personalised meat on the bones." It sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where your expertise is most valuable versus where AI can provide useful structure.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? You've touched on this a bit, but I'm curious - beyond that initial back-and-forth refinement, are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends on the use case. If I'm using AI to answer on the fly questions from students, then it would be more delegating complete tasks - "Give me 5 examples of first conditional usage for intermediate English speakers" or the like. Otherwise, lesson planning or creating placeholder texts for reports will be collaborative. I'll give the AI some info, get the basic structure set up by the AI, ask for some elements to be removed or changed or added etc. It can be handy to ask something along the lines of "is there anything that I've forgotten?" or "what else could enhance the lesson?" at the very end because I can be a bit of a scatterbrain and LLM typically aren't!

AI: I love that insight about using AI as a check against being "a bit of a scatterbrain" - that's such a practical partnership dynamic.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed differences between how it's viewed or used in your primary teaching versus EFL contexts?

User: I would say it is far more pervasive in the EFL field rather than the primary teaching field. It's not that it's prohibited as such - maybe it's more a point of pride from QTS individuals' point? EFL is a little less rigorous, obviously. That said, a lot of long term teachers in both fields have vast amounts of resources that they have saved from previous years and AI can be a really handy in bringing that content up to date - if the government changes curriculum content or the like. I think AI is definitely more prevalent now than it was even just 2-3 years ago. It's just such a time saver! Although obviously it's important to be diligent and carefully check over lesson plans and resources created to ensure there are no mistakes - I'd say any teacher who generates a lesson plan with AI and uses it as is isn't the best teacher. That's probably a pretty common point of view.

AI: That distinction between the fields is really interesting - and your point about teachers needing to be diligent rather than using AI-generated content "as is" seems like an important professional standard.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: On the whole, things usually go pretty smoothly - especially if I'm quite generous with the amount of information that I provide the AI when starting out. However, I've had several instances in the past where LLM have struggled to provide accurate timings for lessons - they run over, run short, or dedicate far too much time to relatively simple tasks while neglecting elements of a lessons that need more time to carry out. That's part of the reason why I prefer to do the timings myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like timing is one of those areas where your teaching experience and intuition about your specific students really can't be replicated by AI.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't found it to be a problem, personally. This is because I don't use AI as a crutch - it's more about being a labour saving device for me, I think. It could take me 2-3 hours to plan and mark and do other admin by myself, but using AI to help plan really cuts down on that time sink. I'm quite careful about not being over reliant on AI usage professionally. I guess there are times where I've used AI to fill a knowledge gap when I could have spent the time to get that knowledge secure within myself, however. For example, I typically teach lower down the year groups, but as a supply teacher I could be thrust into a year 6 class and be faced with teaching a maths lesson on a concept I haven't covered in a long time - I could take steps to maintain comprehensive mathematical knowledge/ability, but it isn't really worth the time it takes versus how often I need to use it. The very short turn around time on arriving at school in the morning, finding out what class you're in and the day's schedule can mean a quick refresher/overview is more important than taking the time to fully read up on a topic. That could be seen as a failing in maintaining certain skills, I suppose.

AI: That's such a practical and honest perspective - especially about those supply teaching situations where you need quick support rather than deep knowledge development. It sounds like you've found a thoughtful balance between efficiency and maintaining your core teaching skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as you become more experienced with it?

User: I guess that really depends on the directions it takes. If I was able to link an LLM to my Google drive and that was filled with my saved lesson plans and I could say "pull up the lesson on gerunds for pre-intermediate..." etc. and use AI to make super quick on the fly changes, that'd be great. But at the moment I feel like it's still early days and the level of consistency and trust in the content isn't quite there yet to completely hand planning over to LLM. I think, looking ahead, my working relationship with AI will be fairly consistent, unless big changes occur. Some enhanced localisation and personalisation features would be great though - LLM often default to US-based content and I obviously have to work within UK curriculum content and British English.

AI: Those are really practical improvements you're envisioning - integration with your existing resources and better localization. The Google Drive integration especially sounds like it would make your workflow much more seamless.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as "scaffolding" that you then personalize, and how you've developed clear boundaries around where your expertise is most valuable versus where AI can save time.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the differences between teaching contexts, and the importance of maintaining professional judgment while leveraging AI's efficiency have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
