Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it mostly for market research such as researching competitors, projects and which firms are associated with those projects. I also use it to communicate by making my emails sound nicer and writing text for a slide deck or report

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're doing that market research - researching competitors and projects - can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically go about that process with AI?

User: It's pretty rudimentary. I just say search up "blank" firm in "blank" market. Like search up architecture firms that do airports in U.S. for example. I don't even add context to the prompt

AI: Interesting - so you keep it pretty straightforward. When you get those results back from that basic prompt, what do you typically do with that information? Do you take it as-is, or do you find yourself needing to verify or dig deeper into what AI gives you?

User: Always verifying. Because AI hallucinates stuff and makes stuff up. Or it'll give me the wrong information. Like if I'm searching up architects it'll give me an engineering firm that doesn't do architecture

AI: That verification step sounds like it's become a regular part of your workflow. When you catch those kinds of errors - like getting an engineering firm instead of an architecture firm - how does that affect your approach? Do you find yourself adjusting how you work with AI, or does it just become part of the process you expect?

User: Part of the process I expect.

AI: Got it - so you've built that verification step right into your routine. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like the creative tasks. For example designing slide decks is fun and I like to exercise the creative part of my brain. I know AI can do this, but I like doing it myself. I also think that AI isn't sophisticated enough to do it yet

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - both the creative enjoyment and the sophistication gap. When you say AI isn't sophisticated enough for slide deck design yet, what specific aspects is it missing? What would need to change for you to feel differently about that?

User: Sometimes the slides just aren't what I want. I don't know how to explain. Then again I haven't really used AI to design a lot of my slides.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you haven't fully explored that area yet. 

When you do use AI for work tasks - like your market research or email writing - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it instructions and let it handle things independently?

User: Let it handle things independently

AI: So you're more of a "delegate and verify" type of user. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people around you using it similarly, or have you seen different approaches?

User: I think my colleagues use it for research tasks as well or deep research and it generates reports as well as graphics like charts and whatnot.

AI: That's helpful to know your colleagues are using it for similar research tasks plus some additional things like reports and charts. Has seeing how they use it - or any conversations you've had with them about AI - changed how you approach it at all? Or are you pretty much sticking with what works for you?

User: Yea like when I saw my coworker use it for deep research I started using it for that too

AI: That's a great example of how workplace learning happens. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Particularly satisfied is when they return results that I could not find on Google. Particularly frustrated is when they do not cite sources so I can't even really verify the info

AI: That source citation issue sounds like a real pain point when you're trying to do that verification step you mentioned earlier. When AI gives you information without sources, how do you handle that? Do you have workarounds, or does it just make certain tasks not worth using AI for?

User: No workarounds. I just kind of give up and not use the info since I can't verify

AI: So that lack of sources can essentially make the work unusable for you. That's a significant limitation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I guess so. I still like designing slide decks even though AI could definitely potentially take this over, but I have to maintain my skills because otherwise I get taken over. For stuff like writing I don't maintain that anymore since I feel like AI will always write better than me

AI: That's really fascinating - you're making conscious choices about which skills to maintain and which to let AI handle. So with writing, you've essentially decided to lean into AI's capabilities there. Does that feel like a loss, or more like a practical decision that frees you up for other things?

User: In some ways it's a loss because I think practicing your writing is a useful skill and it helps with analytical abilities and critical thinking. In other ways it's obviously practical. It frees up my time to do other things

AI: That tension between skill development and practical efficiency sounds like something a lot of people are navigating. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: Not really. I mean if I get assigned different tasks I'd obviously use it for different purposes

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the conscious choice between maintaining skills versus leveraging AI efficiency - that tension you described between writing practice helping with critical thinking versus the practical benefits of using AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Well another point I'd have to point out is that I often have to use Google or search engine to complement AI. I find AI to not fully replace search engines it just kind of complements them at this point

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea that AI and search engines are complementary tools rather than replacements for each other. That gives us a much clearer picture of how you're actually working with these different tools in combination.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about verification workflows, skill maintenance decisions, and how AI fits alongside traditional search will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
