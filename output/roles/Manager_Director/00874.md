Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No. Proceed.

AI: Great, let's dive in. 

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use specialized software that does not especially allow for user variations for data entry. I use AI for ancillary tasks that are still important to do, but not locked down by the company to do so.

AI: That's interesting - so you're working around the constraints of your company's systems to find ways AI can still be helpful. 

Can you tell me more about what those ancillary tasks look like? What specific things are you using AI to help with?

User: For monthly COGS I devised a Google Sheet that cannot use macros but uses complex equations that I started to ask for help to execute.

AI: That sounds like a clever workaround. When you're working on those complex equations for your COGS calculations, can you walk me through what that interaction with AI typically looks like? 

Are you asking for help building the formulas from scratch, or troubleshooting ones you've already started, or something else entirely?

User: Initially it was troubleshooting existing ones. Since it's infrequent, I sometimes forget the proper formula and I found asking Gemini or ChatGPT to be more efficient than googling for the answer.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having AI as a quick reference for formulas you don't use regularly. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: For adding new things to the COGS task, I have found it's better to initiate proceedings on my own. Unfortunately, the models do not understand the specific constraints when asking to help from a blank screen.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - that AI works better as a troubleshooting partner than starting from scratch with your specific constraints.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask it a specific question and then work independently with that answer?

User: Lately, it's more of the latter. At first it was a lot of me expressing frustration because of not being "understood." Without the constraints that I am forced to work with, the models do much better producing formulae.

AI: So it sounds like you've learned to adapt your approach over time - moving from trying to explain all those constraints upfront to just getting what you need and applying it yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others know you're using it for these tasks, or is it something you've kept more to yourself?

User: I mentioned it to my manager that I was going to try to use it to help me. I largely cannot ask for help from my coworkers and was eager to find anything that was a possible solution. Currently, I just assume that my coworkers know that I might be using AI but I do not broadcast it.

AI: That paints a picture of you being somewhat on your own with these tasks and finding AI as a resource when human help isn't available.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was actually using AI at my day job to help with a freelancing job I also do. I was trying to test the model's understanding of a piece of fiction in [REDACTED] and was frustrated that the summary and a fair amount of follow-up questions did not understand the piece.

AI: That's frustrating when you're hoping AI can help with creative work and it's missing key elements of what you've written.

When the AI wasn't understanding your fiction piece, what specifically was it getting wrong? Was it misinterpreting the plot, the characters, or something else about the story?

User: For this particular piece it understood neither the plot nor characters.

AI: That must have been particularly disappointing since you were hoping it could help with your freelancing work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given how you're using it for formula help and potentially creative tasks?

User: I feel secure that my creativity will not be replaced by AI. But I do see a future that someone like me doesn't need to be employed any more for ancillary tasks if a true agentic AI could be developed.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction - feeling confident about your creative abilities while recognizing potential changes for other parts of your work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or keeping it in that troubleshooting role you've found works well?

User: At current, I can only see it as a troubleshooting tool. Further on the road, I may not be allowed to use AI or the company may introduce its own model, or something.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI works better as a troubleshooting partner once you've initiated the work yourself, rather than trying to explain all your constraints upfront.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding practical workarounds within system constraints, and how AI serves as a substitute when human help isn't available, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
