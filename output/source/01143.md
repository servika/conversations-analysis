Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am writer, predominantly of literary fiction. I have written one novel and am in the process of researching another. I like complex books which usually have historical and/or philosophical elements.

AI: That sounds fascinating - literary fiction with historical and philosophical dimensions definitely requires a lot of depth and research. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: With my first novel I spent nearly a year doing preparatory research. At that time I was studying for a PhD in History and was able to freely access online journals and research portals via the university. I'm no longer a student, so I don't have access to those resources now as many are only available to institutions.  I have used AI to help with researching the second novel as it is set in Canada at the start of the second World War. I find using AI very efficient, although I am conscious of the fact that it isn't always truthful.

AI: That's a really interesting shift - from having institutional access to academic resources to relying more on AI for research. Tell me more about how you're using AI specifically for your World War II Canada research. What kinds of questions are you asking it, and how are you working around that truthfulness concern you mentioned?

User: To work around the truthful issue, I double check anything I'm doubtful about. It's time consuming, but not as time consuming as doing the research myself. I am using my grandmother's letters to my grandfather as the basis of the novel. She left the UK and took her two children to Canada at the onset of the war and stayed until the end of it. I have never visited the particular area before and can see on Google Maps how much it has changed in the intervening years. I have used AI to help me build a clearer picture of life in that area in the 1940s, I have also asked it to elaborate on details my grandmother touches on in her letters about the war and also I have asked questions about a white person such as myself writing a book that features First Nation mythology, as I am concerned about getting the approach wrong.

AI: That's such a rich and personal foundation for a novel - using your grandmother's actual letters. It sounds like AI is helping you fill in the contextual gaps around her experiences.

Can you describe a specific recent interaction you had with AI while working on this project? Maybe a particular question you asked about 1940s life in that area, or about approaching First Nation mythology respectfully - and how that conversation with the AI unfolded?

User: I wanted to open the novel with a myth about 'Raven', who was supposedly born on the shores of the area where my novel is set. I asked the model if this would be problematic, but I remember thinking that its answer was too woolly to be helpful. It hedged its bets! I decided in the end not to use it.

AI: That's such a telling example - the AI giving you a hedged, non-committal response when you needed clear guidance on something as sensitive as cultural representation. It sounds like you were looking for more definitive direction but had to make that important creative decision on your own.

When you're working with AI on your research, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: I am driving the creative decisions, but that's because I ask the questions in isolation. For instance, I wanted more information about the experiences of Canadian couples who took in British children during the war. For me to research that would be time consuming, not least because Google is not an efficient search tool. The AI was useful in giving me starting blocks for further research rather than fully fulfilling my needs.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - using AI as starting blocks rather than endpoints. It sounds like you maintain pretty firm control over the creative direction while leveraging AI's efficiency for initial research pathways.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Are there things you approach differently now compared to when you were doing that year of preparatory research for your first novel?

User: Yes. After the work involved in the first novel (I was paranoid about getting historical facts wrong) I decided never to write another book with a historical storyline. Since the advent of AI, writing such a book seems less daunting, not just because it can help with the foundational research but because I suppose you could use it to fact-check aspects of your writing as well. I am currently a bit hesitant about using AI as a beta reader or editorial checker, but I am tempted.

AI: That's fascinating - AI actually changed your mind about writing historical fiction entirely. You went from "never again" to seeing it as less daunting.

Tell me more about that temptation to use AI as a beta reader or editorial checker. What's making you hesitant, and what's drawing you toward trying it?

User: I'm drawn towards it because it would be quick and easy. It would also be cheaper than using a human editor. My reservations stem from two things: firstly, fears around intellectual property/copyright. I don't feel comfortable with 'giving' an AI my novel. Secondly, I'm doubtful about its ability to truly understand the nuances in literary fiction. I suspect it won't 'get' my book!

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - the intellectual property worry and the question of whether AI can truly grasp the subtleties of what you're creating. That phrase "I suspect it won't 'get' my book" really captures something important about the artistic relationship.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's broader presence in your field - in literary fiction and writing more generally?

User: Like most writers, I'm concerned about the idea of AI-generated novels. The market is already flooded with formulaic fiction; I don't believe we need more, we need less. I feel that the quality of the novel is being degraded, and the years of the 'great writers' are all behind us now. Writers used to be intellectuals, they aren't any more. I also love writing and can't understand why anyone would use an AI to write for them - other than to churn out generic books and make money.

AI: Your passion for the craft really comes through - the idea that writing itself is something to be cherished, not automated away. That concern about AI potentially accelerating the production of formulaic content while the quality of literary work feels like it's already declining.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your boundaries around what you're comfortable using it for might shift?

User: I suspect they might. I suspect I may be more open to using an AI for editing and proofreading. The more normalised this becomes, the more likely I am to use it I suppose. I certainly don't ever see myself using it to produce original writing, because as above, I love the act and the art of writing. Also, I don't believe an AI will ever be able to write more eloquently than me!

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how you've articulated that distinction between using AI as research "starting blocks" versus creative endpoints, and your clear boundary around the actual craft of writing being something you want to preserve for yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency while selectively leveraging AI's research capabilities, and your perspective on preserving the integrity of literary craft, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the practical benefits you've found and your deeper concerns about AI's impact on literary culture. Best of luck with your novel about your grandmother's wartime experience - it sounds like a truly meaningful project.
