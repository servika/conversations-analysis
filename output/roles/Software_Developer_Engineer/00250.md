Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI to generate another solution. This is mostly for coding tasks. For example, if I have a task of creating a component, I will ask the AI to generate the code for it and compare it to mine. The comparison allows me to improve my code. I do this to learn different approaches, and determine which approach is more efficient and easier.

AI: That's a really interesting approach - using AI as a comparison point for your own solutions. 

Tell me more about what happens during that comparison process. What are you typically looking for when you're evaluating the differences between your code and the AI's version?

User: I mainly look for improvements, such as edge cases that I've overlooked or mobile optimization.

AI: That makes sense - so you're using AI to catch things you might have missed. 

When you discover these improvements or edge cases in the AI's code, how do you decide whether to incorporate them into your own solution? Do you always adopt the AI's approach, or are there times when you stick with your original method?

User: If the AI's code covers an issue that I wasn't aware of, then I will most likely incorporate them into my solution. For example, if I created a accordion component, and the accordion has a minor issue where it shifts up as it opens, and the AI's code fixed that issue, then I will use the AI's code because it improved my accordion implementation. However, in cases where I'm creating a website following closely with the Figma design, then I will most likely reject any code that's not present in the design. For example, if the design have a carousel that displays the sponsors, where it automatically scrolls through each sponsor, and the AI's code attempts to improve it by adding a navigation control, then I will not use this and stick with my original method because this is not something my client wants.

AI: That's a really thoughtful decision-making process - balancing technical improvements against specific requirements. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain coding tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: In general, I prefer to handle any coding task on my own first, and then use the AI for improvements. This is because I want to build it on my own to understand what needs to be done, and learn from any mistakes I make along the way. The AI could definitely help and it could generate a solution really fast, but this won't help me understand the creation process, which can be troublesome in later stages where I constantly need to modify something to make it perform a certain way.

AI: That's a really insightful approach - prioritizing your own learning and understanding of the creation process.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you start independently, but once you bring AI into the process, are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth conversation with it, or do you tend to get its complete solution and then work with that on your own?

User: I typically have an ongoing back and forth conversation with it. Even when I'm working independently, I use it to brainstorm approaches, ask it how to do something, and ask it to explain how things work. I get its complete solution once I'm done with the task. I use it to see how my work could be done differently.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI as both a thinking partner during the work and then as a reviewer afterward. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you approach it similarly, or have you seen different patterns?

User: My colleagues relies on AI more to get their task done faster. For example, if they need to work on a feature, they'll ask the AI to generate a solution first, then improve it until it's a ideal code. My workplace encourages the use of AI, so I've been using AI to help with every task. AI has became a mentor that shows me the way, and I've become reliant on it to learn how things work.

AI: It sounds like you've found a different balance than your colleagues - they use AI for speed while you use it more for learning. You mentioned that AI has become like a mentor and that you've become reliant on it for learning.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was working on making the website mobile optimized. I asked the AI to incorporate the carousel just like how the other page has done it. My colleague did not create it as a reusable component so I couldn't use their carousel component and had to temporarily copy its implementation. The AI was incapable of replicating the implementation, even though it found where it was and often modifies my existing code unnecessarily. This was a frustrating process because unrelated code was being modified and it completely broken the website. At this point it was taking more time to use the AI to help me code than just going through everything and code it myself.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when the AI was making changes that broke things instead of helping. It's interesting that the AI could find the reference code but couldn't properly replicate it without causing other issues.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really, as of right now I'm not too worried about the AI taking over so I haven't gave much thought. However, I am continuously trying to improve my programming skills and I'd like to think AI as a tool that could assist me to create things more at ease.

AI: That's a healthy perspective - viewing AI as an assistive tool while continuing to develop your own capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your approach might change as AI tools become more sophisticated?

User: Most likely getting more reliant on it as I figure that it's pretty good at it. Essentially, it helps my workflow as it reduces the repetitive tasks I need to do. I don't think my approach will change as AI tools become more sophisticated, because I want to learn continuously.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a comparison tool for learning rather than just for speed - that's a really unique approach compared to how your colleagues use it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really found your learning-focused approach and the way you balance independence with AI assistance quite valuable to understand.

Have a great rest of your day!
