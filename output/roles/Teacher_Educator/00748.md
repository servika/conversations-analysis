Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it every day at work. Most recently, I've used it to help me set up our Google ads account (which was very difficult for me, so I never did it before). Before that, I used AI to help me get our SSL certificate set up on our website. These are two issues that I tried to do on my own, but couldn't get it done on my own. I also used AI to help me design some html pages. I told it that I was using October CMS which uses bootstrap for the framework, so it knew what classes were already available and did the pages in a fraction of the time it would have taken me.

AI: That sounds like AI has been really helpful for tackling some challenging technical tasks. You mentioned these were things you tried to do on your own first but couldn't get done - what was it about working with AI that made the difference in getting those Google ads and SSL certificate issues resolved?

User: I had so many questions. With the SSL certificate, the cms was conflicting with the redirects and I couldn't figure it out, so it helped me do it on the server console. I was able to say 'no, please don't tell me more than one step at a time' and when I ran into trouble, I sent a screen shot of what I was seeing and it said 'this is where it went wrong' and told me what exactly to fix. It was like having a teacher right next to me. With Google ads, there was just too much to learn, so I was never going to take the time to do it. We needed it now and I was overwhelmed. It walked me through step by step and after a full day, we got it done.

AI: That's a fascinating description - having AI act like "a teacher right next to you" who could look at your screen and guide you through problems step by step. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Not many tasks that I prefer to do myself because I get bad writer's block. So, when I need to make ads or social posts, I will definitely use it as a starting point. I usually have to reword things or ask for revisions, but it gets the process going very nicely. I rarely just put the first draft up without editing and adding or redirecting the AI first.

AI: It sounds like AI really helps you break through that writer's block and get the creative process started. You mentioned that you rarely use the first draft as-is and usually need to revise or redirect the AI.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I interact the entire time. I am kind of controlling but have loosened up a lot about what goes out. Quantity is my goal right now.

AI: That's interesting - you describe yourself as "controlling" but also mention you've loosened up, especially with quantity being your goal right now. 

Can you tell me more about what that loosening up process has looked like for you? What changed your approach?

User: When I would ask AI something, it would sometimes give me something very different than what I was expecting and I thought, well this is a different angle that other people might appreciate. So, just getting a variety of perspectives by posing the questions to different AI's or even the same one multiple times has helped me change my perspective.

AI: That's a really insightful shift - discovering that AI's unexpected angles might actually resonate with other people. It sounds like you've started to see value in perspectives you wouldn't have considered on your own.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not really, I am the one teaching others how to use it and letting them know how many ways it can be helpful.

AI: So you're actually the AI advocate in your workplace, showing others the possibilities. That's quite a role to be in.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustated.. not very often, but I was trying to get it to make a schedule for posting and it kept changing a lot of things when I would ask for just one or two small changes. I said, please don't change anything but this and it said it didn't, but it did. That was frustrating. Satisfied was getting the SSL certificate set up because it was such a mess and I had been trying for literally over a year off and on. I gave up and was seriously considering starting with a new domain. That would have sucked.

AI: That SSL certificate success sounds like a huge relief after over a year of struggling with it! And I can definitely see how frustrating it would be when AI changes things you specifically asked it not to touch.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't considered it personally. I see a lot of people in my field trying to convince others that they know the secret to using AI, and making it seem like there's an 'in crowd' or something. That's annoying. I think that's the part that bothers me is that people are trying to use it to take advantage of other people's ignorance or insecurities.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about people creating artificial scarcity or expertise around AI use. It sounds like you see AI as something that should be more accessible rather than gatekept.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it might evolve to where I let it do more of the things it suggests.. 'would you like me to create a chart so you can track your progress?'.. stuff like that

AI: So moving toward accepting more of AI's proactive suggestions rather than just using it reactively when you need help. That sounds like a natural progression from where you started.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you overcome writer's block and technical challenges, and your observation about people trying to gatekeep AI knowledge.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I covered it all :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative teacher, the evolution from being controlling to embracing different perspectives, and your role in helping colleagues discover AI's potential will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
