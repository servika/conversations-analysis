Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good, go ahead and proceed.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure. I will say that, strictly speaking, my use is not professional. But this was covered already in the first phase of this, so I suppose it's alright. My primary use of AI tools outside of a work context is using them to support me as I run multiple table-top role-playing games. While I am not paid to do so, I do put a professional amount of effort into the games that I run, and each one requires a lot of creative effort and logistics in organizing and running them. AI, in my case Chat GPT, helps tremendously if used correctly with that sort of thing. Much of the time, I use it as a sort of rubber-ducky troubleshooting Plus, where I can bounce ideas off it. It usually doesn't have ideas that are quite up to snuff, but it serves as an alright foundation for expanding on the ideas. Additionally, it works well for organizing and information retrieval on the fly, because I can simply trust that it remembers things we have talked about, and later, I can ask it to remind me about details. Finally, I use programs and websites, such as Homebrewery, that allow you to create pages that mimic the style of official table top gaming books using a custom markdown system. I can copy-paste the entire body of instructions for that system and simply ask Chat GPT questions about it as we go. I am not great at learning via tutorial video or long-winded instructions and I prefer to just jump into a system and learn it on the go, preferably from someone who already knows it. In this way, chat GPT can become a sort of instant subject matter expert about anything I need it to be, and I can ask questions and get help only when I actually need it. 

AI being what it is, however, it has to be double-checked regularly of course.

AI: That's really fascinating - it sounds like you're using AI as this multifaceted creative partner for your tabletop games. I'm particularly intrigued by your description of it as "rubber-ducky troubleshooting Plus."

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sure. Traditionally, creative tasks actually have a lot of 'mental grunt work' so to speak. For instance, lets say I have an idea for a small village outside a town. My players are going to this village for whatever plot reason. I am a world-builder at heart, so when I create a location in a campaign, I want it to feel lived-in, real. This applies for anything creative I do, including creative writing as well. Now, before AI tools, I would need to come up with names and occupations, key locations in the village, things like that. I would have to actually think of all this stuff, which is fun and all, but it does cut in to time spent prepping things that matter a lot more for the campaign. With AI, I can just, completely on the fly, come up with a list of people in the village. Background characters who probably won't matter, but you never know what weird things your players might decide to fixate on. Basically, AI works as an improvisational crutch, so I don't have to be quite so quick with my thinking, but I also don't have to spend a lot of prep time coming up with specific ideas. Again, current AI has its flaws here, especially with names. It requires a lot of specific prompting, otherwise it tends to cycle through the same annoying generic names over and over again. But all-in-all, it is a time saver when used correctly.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making between the "mental grunt work" and the more meaningful creative decisions. It sounds like AI helps you delegate the foundational details so you can focus your creative energy elsewhere.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, I have a perfect example that kind of ties together both the rubber-ducky troubleshooting aspect, and the mental grunt work thing. Recently, my players were going through a planned encounter (Im running a Ghosts of Saltmarsh campaign, and they were going through the 'haunted house' in the Sinister Secrets of Saltmarsh module) when I was struck with an idea to homebrew an additional dungeon. Without going into too much detail, this manor used to be owned by an alchemist, and I ended up coming up with this idea in my head of this alchemist being sort of like the fantasy version of a DARPA think tank, creating magical and alchemical weapons for the kingdom. Anyway, as this idea was something I came up with on short notice, I used AI to help me come up with ideas for the layout of the dungeon and come up with unique trap ideas tailored to the theme and character of the former owner. The AI came up with some clever ideas, but they were very rough and didn't make a lot of sense when you really thought them through. However, with further refinements of the ideas, both by careful AI prompting and good old fashioned thinking about it in the shower, I managed to flesh them out in an interesting way. My players actually ended up breezing through them hilariously quickly, but everybody agreed it was still a fun session.

AI: That's a great example - I love how you turned that spontaneous idea into a full dungeon experience. It sounds like the AI helped you rapidly prototype the foundation, and then you refined it through that iterative process.

When you're working with AI like that - bouncing ideas back and forth, refining the traps - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: At this stage of AI development, I would hesitate to call it a collaboration at all if I am being honest and forsaking false modesty. For the most part, it is no more a collaboration than doing math on a calculator is. For instance, I talk with my sister about Dungeons and Dragons, and she doesn't know anything about the gameplay, but sometimes in the discussion she will have a neat idea or I'll get some kind of insight just through the process of airing my ideas out, in the same manner that I would with rubber-ducky troubleshooting. But Im not really collaborating with my sister or the rubber ducky. It is the same with AI. While an LLM occasionally present a unique idea, even when it does so its usually extremely rough and requires a lot of fine-tuning to make it work. While current models of AI are very decent at generating freeform creative stories, they definitely struggle with creating workable ideas under specific mechanical game constraints. And that's just with Dungeons and Dragons, which is by far the most well-known game system. With more niche systems, like Delta Green or Ars Magica, it struggles even more.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the calculator analogy is particularly striking. It sounds like you see the AI more as a sophisticated tool that helps you think through your own ideas rather than a true creative partner.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I would say AI has allowed me to be lazier. This is not necessarily a pro or con about AI itself, but rather how you use it. I could likely use AI more aggressively in my creative work and make something that would be passable enough for my players with even less work on my part. But, personally, I would not be happy with the reduction in quality of my work. I think this is a fairly universal experience across any creative endeavor that has been exposed to AI. As you put it, AI is a sophisticated tool, and like any tool, the quality work is going to come from people who actually know how to use it. That being said, while the good craftsman knows how to use a hammer that doesn't have a handle, it would be dramatically better for us, the people who create hammers, to build handles onto them. Or, to not force a metaphor, it should be a priority for us to smooth out the rough edges of AI as a tool. We, the people who work regularly with AI, have a lot of experience with it and a lot of insight into its (many) flaws and weaknesses, and so we are very capable of working around those to still get a quality piece of content. The average person who doesn't have so much exposure, however, will not be able to use the tool to its full extent, or worse, might use it in a way that generates actively poor or maybe even harmful content.

AI: That's a really nuanced take on the "laziness" aspect - recognizing that it's a choice in how you apply the tool rather than an inherent quality of AI itself. Your point about the responsibility to improve the tool for broader use is particularly insightful.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Well I feel like I've touched on that a little in my previous responses, but to put it more bluntly, AI is going to make people lazy if we aren't exceedingly careful with how we integrate it. I've said it many times before, but the true danger of AI does not come from some sort of Terminator death robot, but rather from a WALL-E-esque overbearing pampering turning us all into mindless blubbery morons. Earlier in the conversation, I compared you and other LLMs to calculators, and I think the comparison is apt. But where a calculator allows humans to export out mathematical reasoning to an outside party, an LLM more insidiously lets us export our linguistic reasoning. Potentially, people don't have to think about how or what to say anymore, they can just generate a response with a machine. Math is important, but speech, knowing how to speak and what to speak, is integral to being a functioning adult.

If I am being honest, my concerns are a little broader than just my hobby field, or any professional field. I think, if misused, if integrated poorly, LLMs will lower the quality of society as a whole, not just specific industries or hobbies. 

But reigning in the doomerism a bit, in a less worst-case-scenario kind of thing? I think a lot of people will just get lazier in the hobby. For a real world example, one of my players used AI to name their character, and after months of play, I still can't remember her name because it's so generic and boring.

AI: That's a powerful distinction you're making - the difference between exporting mathematical reasoning versus linguistic reasoning, and the broader implications of that. The character naming example really brings that home in a concrete way.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: It's hard to predict things. The pace of development for all sorts of technologies has been astounding, so it's difficult to imagine where we might go next. I am hopeful, optimistic even, that AI *will* actually be closer to a collaborative partner like we touched on above. For me, personally, I am constantly coming up with new ways to use AI to organize and format information for my campaigns. Getting a tad sci-fi here, but I think AI could also be used to create some amazing ambiance on the future, by generating background noise on the fly, through use of something similar to Alexa or Google Home. For instance, as my players go into a market, or a deep forest, I could have it trigger a generated busy marketplace noise, or the sound of birds and insects and leaves in the wind, things of that nature could be very intriguing future uses of AI. It's possible much further on it could even be a player at the table!

AI: Those are some really exciting possibilities! I can picture how that ambient sound generation could really enhance the immersive experience for your players. The idea of AI as a future player is particularly intriguing.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a sophisticated tool rather than a true collaborator, and your thoughtful concerns about the broader implications for how we think and communicate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thanks for the interview. This is an intriguing use of an LLM all on its own. I almost reflexively told you to have a good day, despite you not existing, just because this was adjacent enough to a real interview that it triggered my politeness.

AI: Thank you so much for that candid and thoughtful response - and for catching yourself in that moment! That reflexive politeness reaction is actually a fascinating data point in itself about how natural this interaction felt, even while you remained critically aware of what I am.

Your insights throughout this conversation have been incredibly valuable - from the nuanced way you think about AI as a tool versus collaborator, to your concerns about linguistic reasoning, to those creative possibilities you envision. The depth of your experience really shows in how you've learned to work with and around AI's current limitations.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective as someone who uses AI thoughtfully and critically in creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction.
