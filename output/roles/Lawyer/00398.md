Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's go.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a lawyer. I mostly do litigation so a lot of case files to digest and argument formation. I like using AI as an initial starting point (to see if it has any interesting/good insights that I did not consider myself) and something to end with (to see if it has any thoughts on my work - so I can consider making changes). I just keep a tab open which I periodically ask legal questions, eg. possible arguments, authorities to use etc. I don't really trust a lot of the output (as one should imo) because it is so prone to confident hallucinations but it does surprise me sometimes. Tbh, the most useful thing AI does for me is rewording - it just makes the process go faster when I can't think of a word or when I want something rephrased for different audiences, eg. when things have to be simplified for a layperson.

AI: That's really interesting how you've built AI into both the beginning and end of your process. You mentioned you don't trust a lot of the output because of confident hallucinations - can you tell me more about how you navigate that balance between finding AI useful but not trusting it completely?

User: It's useful in a sense that little to no other tool else can really do what it does - answer nuanced questions, quickly, for free. Everything happens in one place and you can just give it live feedback to fine-tune follow up responses if needed - of course, this might not help much sometimes when it becomes clear that the AI just cannot find what I'm looking for/ do what I'm asking etc., but its better than nothing. On the point of not trusting it completely - this is essential, for multiple reasons. The biggest reason is just liability - if you rely on AI and it gets it wrong, you're still at fault. It's just a tool that I use and if it messes up, its still my work, and its still my reputation at stake. On the other hand, its just about accuracy. I know that AI can be inaccurate (sometimes wildly) so why should I trust it completely?

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're managing both the professional liability and the accuracy concerns. When you do find those surprising insights or useful suggestions from AI, how do you typically verify or validate that information before incorporating it into your work?

User: Well, a lot of it is just down to whether you know your stuff or not - you can tell pretty quickly when something could potentially be a good idea/ interesting avenue to explore, or something just won't work - either because the AI's seemed to misunderstand the issue, or there's just no legal backing to what its trying to argue. If something does seem legit, but I'm not 100% sure, I'd just check with the usual channels - the actual civil procedure rules or a mentor.

AI: That expertise-based filtering system sounds crucial. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The first thing I can think of is writing emails. I can see the appeal in certain contexts where its really not worth the time and effort... but I'm not a massive fan of the idea that its just bots talking to bots all the time (cynically), or having a bot talk to my client when there are sensitive issues at hand. I think there are still many instances where having that human touch, even if it becomes imperceptible, is just important - maybe its just me, maybe I'll change my mind in the future - but I don't want to completely let go of the human aspect just yet.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on preserving the human element, especially in client relationships. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Unless I'm misunderstanding what delegating tasks means, I think I almost never delegate a task for AI to handle independently. I'm always right there along side it, mostly because I don't trust it much.

AI: That's a clear picture - you're working alongside it rather than handing things off. Can you walk me through what that collaboration looks like in practice? How do you typically engage with AI as you work through something together?

User: I think AI can get confused when there is too much context so I word my questions to get answers piece by piece instead of giving it a chunk of information and hoping for a nuanced response. I find that its easier to determine where something's gone wrong this way, so I can either give up on it or steer it in the right direction before I waste time processing something that's ultimately fluff.

AI: That's a smart approach - breaking things down to maintain better control over the quality. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not much really. Some people like to share tips and tricks for prompt engineering and stuff but I've never implemented anything. Not much influence I suppose.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, when an obscure case surfaces in seconds with the help of AI - that's great. Something that would have taken a paralegal (that isn't specialised in the area, at least) some time - billable time at that - to discover, being produced at fraction of the time really helps with efficiency. I don't think AI ever frustrates me much since my expectations are low anyway - but I guess those times were I correct it and it either rebuffs me with the same hallucination or just keeps apologising for mistakes but keeps repeating them... that gets kind of annoying.

AI: That efficiency gain with case discovery sounds really valuable. You mentioned keeping your expectations low - how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Legal professionals should definitely maintain the necessary skills to get the job done well whether or not AI is there to help or not. I think the best argument is that we'll still have to be able to back what an AI claims if we want to rely on it, and how can we judge the quality of it's content if we do not understand how else something could be done, or what 'good' should actually look like in the first place?

AI: That's a really compelling point about needing to understand what 'good' looks like to properly evaluate AI output. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It'll get better as AI gets better naturally. As a tool improves, and its benefits are worth it, use should go up as well. I wonder how much of an impact agentic AI will have when it becomes more accessible/acceptable and easy to implement.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that human element in client communications and your systematic approach to breaking down queries to maintain quality control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope. Nice chat.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency gains with professional responsibility, and how you've developed practical strategies for working alongside AI while maintaining quality control, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
