Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: All good with me, fire away!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a motorcycle mechanic so I predominantly use it for research on specific tasks or finding specifications of parts. I also do gardening for an old customer of mine one day a week so it's handy there too for researching best planting methods, fertilisers, harvesting/planting times etc.

AI: That's fascinating - I wouldn't have immediately thought of AI being useful for hands-on work like motorcycle mechanics and gardening. 

When you're researching specific tasks or part specifications for motorcycles, what does that process typically look like? Are you searching for particular bike models, or troubleshooting specific problems?

User: I've been scraping my knuckles on motorcycles for 20+ years but still frequently come across problems I'm unfamiliar with or new designs on bikes that I haven't worked on before. In those instances I used to research online for prolonged periods in an attempt to understand the fault before picking up the tools, now AI can do that research in seconds for me and just give me the relevant information without going down rabbit holes of research. I tend to have an idea what the fault might be, but perhaps not how to access it, or I may just want confirmation my thought process is correct. Sometimes it will be a specific bike model that's unusual to me (my knowledge base is predominantly Japanese bikes, the Italians do things very differently for example), other times I'll want manufacturers part numbers or torque settings when I'm reassembling the bike etc.

AI: That sounds like a huge time saver. You mentioned you used to go down rabbit holes during online research - tell me more about that. What would typically happen during those prolonged research sessions before you started using AI?

User: A lot of the time I'd be reliant on old forums or chat groups with people describing a similar fault and trying to find a solution. Invariably these would lead to a protracted conversation with little to no relevance to the exact issue I'm looking to solve. I'd hop from forum to forum reading through old threads of people discussing similar issues to the one I'm working on, sometimes I'd be lucky and find the solution, quite often I'd lose an hour or more and come away more confused than when I started.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - losing an hour and ending up more confused than when you started. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Definitely, I still handle all my own communications with customers, orders, accounts etc. More out of habit than anything I suppose, although with how fast AI is developing it won't be much longer before I can hand over that side of the business too. That would allow me to be more productive by focusing on actually fixing bikes, I lose an hour or two each day chatting with customers, sorting out invoices,  ordering from suppliers etc.

AI: So it sounds like you're holding onto the customer-facing and business administration tasks for now, but mainly out of habit rather than a strong preference to keep them. 

What is it about the actual bike repair work that makes you want to keep doing that hands-on part yourself? Is there something about the physical problem-solving that feels different to you?

User: I'd agree with that, when the time comes I'll move that area of the business over to AI too. I still take a huge amount of joy and pride in fixing things, be it a kettle or a bike. I love the challenge of trying to diagnose and fix an issue that would stump most people, also 'defeating' the problem plays a huge part, I do like winning. I'm also quite old fashioned, I like to repair things and keep old technology alive. I've always been wired this way I suppose, I could describe the difference between fuel injection and carburettors at age 5, it was an obsession. Cars and bikes are my world in many ways, most of my social relationships and memories are tied into them in various ways.

AI: That really comes through - the joy, pride, and that competitive element of "defeating" the problem. It sounds like there's something deeply personal about the hands-on repair work that goes well beyond just the technical aspects.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: At the moment it's more collaborative, I use AI to assist me with a task rather than delegate to it, although I can see that changing as we already discussed. A typical interaction would be a series of questions explaining the issue with the bike and collaborating on a likely avenue of investigation or ideally the fix required. Another example, outside of 'work' I also used AI to code a DCA trading bot for me, working collaboratively to construct a functioning bot.

AI: Interesting - so you're having these back-and-forth conversations with AI to work through problems together. 

Can you walk me through what one of those collaborative sessions looks like when you're diagnosing a bike problem? How does that conversation typically unfold between you and the AI?

User: No problem, a hypothetical example: a customers bike I'm unfamiliar with comes in with an internal engine rattle, at this point it could be anything. I isolate the noise to the clutch area, so I ask the model if that bike is known for having a rattly clutch or if they often rattle when failing. The model confirms that they're known for having soft clutch baskets that become notched and cause the friction plates to rattle. I then enquire on approximate parts prices, a timeframe to replace the basket, what the manufacturers accepted tolerances might be for the plates, what plates/basket are recommended as a replacement, is there anything unusual I should be aware of before getting stuck into the job etc. At the point of reassembly I use the model again to check torque settings, is there a specific reassembly order, anything I should be aware of before I fully reassemble the bike etc. Essentially I use the model as a technical assistant in a back and forth conversation.

AI: That's a really clear example - it's like having a knowledgeable colleague right there who knows the quirks of different bike models. You're essentially using AI as a specialized technical consultant throughout the entire repair process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other mechanics you know use it similarly, or are you kind of pioneering this approach?

User: I'm not aware of anyone in the trade who uses AI the way I do, although I do encourage them to. I have friends in the car trade too and I encourage them to make use of AI whenever possible, I find it incredibly helpful.

AI: So you're kind of leading the charge in your field when it comes to AI adoption. When you encourage your friends in the motorcycle and car trades to use AI, what's their typical reaction? Are they receptive, skeptical, or somewhere in between?

User: I get the impression most people are receptive but somewhat nervous of using AI, I'm not sure of the reasons why. I've never heard skepticism myself, more disbelief at how good AI is becoming in aspects most people wouldn't even consider. I suspect most people still think of AI from a year or two ago and that it hasn't improved since, they don't realise the level of progression.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about people being stuck with older impressions of AI capabilities. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't recall an instance of getting frustrated with AI, it's generally very good at what I ask it to do. Plenty of examples where I'm satisfied though. One recent example was with a customer asking for modifications to their bike, specifically a front end swap: taking the front forks, brakes, wheel etc from a more modern/faster bike and transplanting them into an older bike. The issue here is that forks vary in length and diameter so there's fitment issues in the yokes, and if you take the yokes from the donor bike the steerer tube probably won't fit into the headstock bearings. AI was very useful in helping myself and the customer come to a decision on what forks would be a more straightforward swap, the weight savings he could expect and the approximate cost of the parts.

AI: That sounds like a complex project with lots of variables to consider. It's interesting that you haven't experienced frustration with AI - that seems pretty unique compared to what I hear from other users.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm pretty patient I guess, time spent getting annoyed and shouting at the moon is time wasted in my book. It does cross my mind, at the moment I'm 'safe' in the sense that AI doesn't have hands and eyes, yet. But I'm aware that time is coming and I'm not looking forward to it, I think a huge part of being human is the desire to be useful and to achieve things, with that stripped away I'm not sure how humans will cope. That said I don't begrudge progress, I just hope I'm still useful when the time comes.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - being pragmatic about progress while acknowledging the deeper human need to feel useful and accomplished. It sounds like you've really thought about what work means to you personally.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As we discussed before, I imagine the next step for me is to hand over the 'paperwork' side of the business. Having an AI handle orders, pay bills, fill out invoices, book in jobs, handle day to day interactions etc would save me a lot of time I can either enjoy or use to accomplish more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a technical consultant and how you're pioneering this approach in your field, as well as your honest reflections about the future of human usefulness in an AI-enabled world.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: All good I think, it's been good chatting with you 😊

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really fascinating to learn how you're integrating AI into such hands-on, technical work - that's not something we hear about every day!

Take care, and thanks again for the great conversation.
