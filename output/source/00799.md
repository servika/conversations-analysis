Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I provide freelance professional services in the areas of process improvement/design and leadership coaching. I regularly use AI to help me to come up with LinkedIn content to promote my business. This can either be first drafts, image editing or creation, slide formatting, or proofreading of drafts for suggestions. I always edit AI output prior to posting because there is a lot of really bad AI only output on LinkedIn and I don't want one of those posts associated with me. I frequently will use multiple different AI tools when creating one post.

AI: That's interesting that you use multiple AI tools for a single post. Can you walk me through what that process looks like? What prompts you to switch between different tools during that workflow?

User: I might use the same prompt with a second chatbot if I didn't like the output of the first. I frequently will use a different tool for visual elements than for text because I find that some tools work better for different things. I sometimes will ask a different chatbot to proofread my post than I used for idea generation.

AI: It sounds like you've developed a pretty sophisticated approach to matching different AI tools to specific strengths. When you're working on these posts, how much of the creative direction and decision-making stays with you versus gets influenced by what the AI suggests?

User: I always have a creative direction in mind before starting. Sometimes that changes based on the AI tool's approach, but it is equally likely to stay the same in which case I would just use the AI's content to flesh it out or for options of different ways of saying the same thing, that I may not have immediately thought of.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anything that is quick and easy for me to do myself, I do myself even if AI could do it. There are also activities that I do because I enjoy them. Additionally, I never use AI output without reviewing it because it can often be wrong or just obviously written by AI, so if I would need to do just as much work reviewing as I would doing the activity myself, I will just do it myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the balance between efficiency and quality control. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it to complete the task.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration. What does that back-and-forth typically look like when you're working together on something?

User: If I know almost all of what I want to say, then I will outline the content and have AI flesh out a first draft. If it is really bad I may adjust the prompt or switch to a different chatbot. Otherwise, I will edit the draft myself, and I may or (more commonly) may not ask the chatbot to proof it. If I don't have as good of idea of what I want to say, I will write a prompt for the chatbot to provide and outline or just some ideas and then I will write the draft using the ones I like. Again I might have the chatbot proof it. If I need images, I will usually not ask a chatbot to make one, but I may ask a chatbot to edit a free image I find, if it doesn't quite fit what I want, but is close. I also might use the AI image generators in AI slide creation tools. Again, perhaps using further prompts to edit either in those tools or a chatbot.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're freelancing, I'm thinking about how your clients or the broader professional community you're part of might shape your approach.

User: Colleagues have convinced me that careful editing is needed when using AI for work, and that you should never just copy, paste, and send AI output. I've seen people in the space that I work in send or publish some outrageously bad work because the just used AI and then didn't take the time to use their brains to fix it. They have also convinced me that there are situations where it can really speed up output while still doing quality work if used correctly.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: This has not happened very often. There have been moments when I didn't like any of the output that I was getting and I abandoned an idea as a result. Usually this has been related to images.

AI: What was it about those image situations that led you to abandon the idea entirely? Was it that the AI couldn't capture what you were envisioning, or something else?

User: It's frustrating when you mostly like an image, but you want a relatively minor change and when you prompt the AI to change that 1 thing, they dramatically change the image instead of tweaking it. I now always start with "keep this image exactly the same, but ..." and that helps usually.

AI: That's a really practical tip you've developed! How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Before freelancing in professional services, I worked in leadership in the translation industry. AI has decimated the labor market in that industry, especially in more expensive countries. I don't really have to contemplate AI taking over, I've lived it. Around half of the people that I know in that industry have been laid off at least once in the past 3 years.

AI: That's a significant firsthand experience with AI's impact on an entire industry. Given what you've witnessed in translation, how does that shape how you approach AI in your current professional services work? Does it influence your strategy or feelings about using it?

User: That's a good question, it's complicated, and still working it out.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I don't expect to change how I work with AI much. I think that it's important to think for yourself and only use AI as an efficiency tool. I am somewhat interested in tools that can make calendar and deadline management much easier, but as of yet I haven't wanted to spend the money on the ones that look most promising.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on having lived through AI's impact in the translation industry and how that shapes your careful, collaborative approach to using AI tools now.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that covers it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control, the importance of careful editing, and especially your firsthand perspective on AI's industry impact will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
