Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, no questions so far.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then. 

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in the production side of a coffee roaster, so there are a lot of areas in which I use AI --not all are on a daily basis. First there are any math related things that I need to double check. For example, if im mixing a coffee blend and know the ratio is 3:1 and I need to make 30 lbs, I might double check that its 22.5 lbs to 7.5, or if the ratios are less common, I might just use AI to make sure the numbers are right.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a mathematical safety net in coffee production. Tell me more about those less common ratios you mentioned. What makes those situations different from the straightforward 3:1 example?

User: Sorry, I didn't mean to send the last message prematurely. I was going to say that I also use AI for trouble shooting for mechanical issues that may  arise (I deal with grinders, roasters, bag sealers, shipping label printers, etc). I also use AI for trouble shooting when software goes wrong. For example, the other day our Zebra printer started acting up so I used AI to figure out what was wrong and how to fix it (the problem was quickly solved this way). As far as the ratios, there might be a blend that's 65%, 20%, 15% for example, and this for a 30 or 15 lbs batch I wouldn't know off the top of my head. Hence, AI. basically what makes them different is that I wouldn't know the ratios for certain batch numbers quickly, so I usually just do the math and double check it with AI OR  just do it with AI to start if  I'm short on time.

AI: That paints a really clear picture - AI as both your calculation partner and your troubleshooting assistant across all that equipment. 

When you're dealing with those mechanical or software issues, like the Zebra printer situation, how do you typically approach the interaction with AI? Do you describe the problem and work through it step by step together, or do you give it all the details upfront and let it provide a complete solution?

User: I usually give many details upfront. Although, I should say that I usually make an effort to think critically and only offer details that are important in understanding the problem and potential solutions. The models usually take in all the information well and then make step-by-step plans for moving forward. I find that this approach works better than starting with too little information, and saves time in the long run. I mean, since I also work in AI for my other job, I know its limitations and try not to be vague in my prompts while also not overloading it with information.

AI: That's fascinating that you have experience working in AI as well - that dual perspective must really shape how you interact with these tools. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI in your coffee production role. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Okay, so I definitely try to do almost everything myself IF I believe that I have the tools to solve a problem in my head. A good example are the arithmetic problems I run into. I much prefer to use my brain as much as possible and have AI double check me than have AI simply think for me. On the other hand, I'm not gonna mess around with a machine I am not familiar with for hours (wasting company time), when I could just use AI (or YouTube) so give me the information I need to actually fix the machine. Moreover, I want to understand everything I work with the best I can (this is for both personal and practical reasons). So, if AI is going to handicap me from understanding  something in the future, I will very much limit my use of it, so that I feel I fixed a problem while also understanding WHY the problem occurred in the first place.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a verification tool for things you can do, but leveraging it for knowledge transfer when you're outside your expertise. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The Zebra printer for one.. it just worked out great and I wrote down the instructions the AI told me in case anyone else came across the same issue in the future. Iv'e never really been too frustrated with AI, but I will say it does feel limited in more "practical knowledge" issues.

AI: Tell me more about what you mean by "practical knowledge" issues. What kinds of situations have you run into where AI feels more limited?

User: well, the other day one of our shipping label printers was printing weird (a common occurrence if you can't tell by now), and it kept cropping off the bottom of the label, which was the number associated with the barcode. I needed to know if this was imperative to keep on the label or if it was just for the sake of redundancy. Essentially, would USPS deny the tag because the number wasn't there, even though the actual barcode was there. It took the AI about twice as long to help me find a "practical" answer. In fact, I ended up just using the specific links to USPS info websites rather than the AI's opinion. I wasn't really frustrated though because I knew this was kind of a hard ask for an AI to answer.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like AI struggled with that real-world, industry-specific nuance about USPS requirements. You ended up going directly to the authoritative source instead.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you use it similarly, or do you notice different approaches?

User: So my boss (the one who owns the coffeeshop/ roasting house), absolutely loves to use AI; this definitely encourages me to use AI more in the workplace. In contrast, I've had bosses in the past that do not like to see you on your phone, even if it's work related. So, that has motivated me to use AI more, simply because I know he is perfectly fine with it (and even encourages it). The other coffee roaster I work with is an older man, and really only uses AI in the sense that the coffee roasting process uses ML to collect roasting data in order to  track/improve results. I don't think I've ever really seen him use any chatbot models --He's very intelligent and capable when it comes to everything he does, so I don't really think he has the need to use it. My other coworkers are all baristas and usually don't use AI while on the clock as their jobs are very fast paced, although I'm pretty sure they use AI on their own time to fix issues they typically run into.

AI: It sounds like your boss's enthusiasm really opens up that space for you to use AI freely. That contrast with past bosses who discouraged phone use is striking.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think the way you use it will change as the tools develop or as you get more experience with them?

User: I really don't see a lot of room for improvement. I know that I will use it in the future as we are expanding our wholesale output and are going to make some simple machines from scratch to help in automation. This will definitely require AI to expedite the process. Almost all of the software we use already has AI assistants, and those could definitely improve. But off the top of my head I can't think of any specific avenues that would drastically change my work flow.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has found its natural place in your workflow already. You mentioned making simple machines from scratch for automation as you expand wholesale. Tell me more about that - what kind of role do you see AI playing in that process?

User: well, whenever you make anything form scratch, there are going to be many unexpected issues that arise. In my experience, Youtube can teach you almost any concept you need to know, but the hard parts are 1) knowing what to look up in the first place, 2) what to do when something arises that is out of the realm of the pre-researched topics, or 3) when you just come across an issue that could be caused by multiple things. An example for the third point, if we make a mixer from scratch and we buy a motor that should "in theory" work, yet it is not quite giving the desired torque, this could be the result of many possible mistakes; maybe its not getting an appropriate power level, maybe we used a wrong gear ratio, maybe we simply bought the wrong motor by mistake. AI is extremely helpful in thinking of possible reasons for issues on the spot.

AI: That makes complete sense - AI as your diagnostic partner for those multi-variable problems where you need to consider all the possibilities quickly. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to verify your own thinking rather than replace it, and how workplace culture really shapes when and how you feel comfortable using these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thank you. No, nothing is coming to mind at the moment.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing verification versus delegation, the importance of understanding the "why" behind solutions, and how workplace culture influences AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with the wholesale expansion and those automation projects!
