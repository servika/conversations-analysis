Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not! Let us begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI systems to help brainstorm ideas and or to identify new ideas based on current practices or projects actively being researched.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a creative thinking partner. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? When you say "brainstorm ideas" or "identify new ideas," what does a typical interaction actually look like for you?

User: Working as a Reliability Engineering in a manufacturing environment, there's a strong desire to identify optimized asset management strategies for maintaining equipment reliability and availability. Brainstorming ideas typically refers to providing raw feedback regarding equipment history and/or availability metrics and then determining what kind of stochastic models could be applicable for simulating the environment. Alternatively, brainstorming for maintenance strategies may include identifying a specific type of asset, sub-asset, or individual component and requesting feedback on what typically would be an optimized approach for maintaining it.

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially using AI to help analyze complex technical scenarios and recommend maintenance approaches. 

When you provide that raw equipment data and availability metrics to AI, what happens next in your process? Do you typically take the AI's suggestions and run with them, or is there more back-and-forth discussion to refine the recommendations?

User: The recommendations provide a general framework for what an appropriate strategy may be. Still, refinement is almost always required to incorporate specific elements depending on the asset's function, utilization, environmental conditions, human interaction elements, etc. Generally, generally the initial recommendation is meant to achieve and objective approach to what would optimize the asset's reliability while follow-up questions help incorporate subjective elements that could have outside influence.

AI: That's a really helpful distinction - starting with an objective framework and then layering in the subjective, context-specific factors. 

Tell me more about that refinement process. When you're working through those follow-up questions to incorporate things like environmental conditions or human factors, how does that collaboration typically unfold? Are you guiding the AI through each consideration, or does it help you think through what factors you might be missing?

User: It's actually a mixture of both. While I'll obviously include real, factual conditions that may impact or have impacted the asset in some way, the AI's role is to always provide insight into what other factors of influence may not have been readily identified. Feeding an AI model specific failure data and asking it how to address those specific failure modes would be effective at improving reliability metrics but may not address underlying root causes of the those failure modes that aren't readily apparent through failure history. Likewise, AI models may have access to additional resources and information that can offer an alternative perspective on addressing failure modes rather than traditional expertise from seasoned veterans.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to leverage AI - using it to surface blind spots and bring in perspectives that might not emerge from traditional experience alone.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your reliability engineering work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Data and statistical analysis are particular areas that I am hesitant to rely on AI for. While there remains opportunity for brainstorming formulation of problems, applying statistical analysis methods often requires contextual understanding of the systems and the application of the data to properly formulate the analysis elements. AI is certainly able to formulate quickly, but does it understand the system information and data sets thoroughly enough to formulate the right analysis? Possibly! The issue becomes that if an AI-drive data analysis it communicated outwards through the organization or even a customer base but is evidently proven incorrect, reliance on the AI model would draw intense skepticism to the reliability efforts aligned with them.

AI: That's a really insightful point about organizational trust and accountability. It sounds like the stakes of being wrong with statistical analysis are particularly high in your context.

When you say AI might not understand the system information thoroughly enough - can you give me an example of what that contextual understanding looks like? What's something about your systems or data that you feel requires that deeper, human comprehension to get the analysis right?

User: If you were to take a series of assets and, using calculable reliability of the system based on a percent likelihood of survival for a mission time, ask an AI model to identify the most critical assets, the model would likely standardize it's criticality hierarchy as assets most likely to fail in the mission time window down to the least likely. Objectively, this is probably a reasonable assumption if reliable failure history is provided for the assets in that particular system. However, the subjective conditions may relate to asset orientation, available contingency plans, technician skill levels for area-specific maintenance, expected repair times, operational redundancies, etc.

AI: That's a perfect example - the AI might give you a technically correct ranking based on failure probability, but miss the operational reality of what actually makes an asset critical to your specific operation.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you're doing quite a bit of back-and-forth refinement. Are you more likely to collaborate with AI throughout a task like this, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'll rarely delegate a specific task to an AI but typically use them as a sounding board at the onset of a new or previously developed asset management strategy evaluation. By feeding in known failure history and asset-specific information, similar to what was referenced in the last response, the majority of the asset management strategy development occurs during a conversation with the model to identify what is likely to be the most cost-effective approaches and what may be considered extraordinary maintenance. Further refinement may come after-the-fact when a strategy is developed and the model is offered the chance to evaluate the final strategy. The idea being that the model can provide even more context on whether the finished strategy plan aligns with predicted failure modes.

AI: That's a really sophisticated approach - using AI as both a strategic thinking partner at the beginning and then as a validation check at the end. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your organization approaching AI similarly, or have you found yourself navigating different attitudes about its role in reliability engineering?

User: There's certainly different attitudes regarding the usage of AI. The organization as a whole embraces its usage but cautions against over-reliance. In the same vein, working in a heavy manufacturing environment comes with a high level of accountability for engineers making decisions regarding asset management and really any aspect that may impact safety, quality, and operational control. Relying solely on an AI system to build an asset management system would likely provide an overall robust solution, but the inability to hold a AI system accountable for system failures necessitates an additional level of scrutiny by experienced professionals before publishing as a defined strategy.

AI: That accountability piece is really crucial - the human element of being able to answer for decisions when safety and operations are on the line.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI systems actually helped develop what became my organization's defined process for evaluating asset criticality. I was the primary engineer tasked with developing the process and spent many painstaking hours brainstorming approaches by partnering with AI to rationalize criteria for defining asset criticality in a wide range of manufacturing environments found within various facilities of our organization. The end result was eventually adopted by our Risk Management group as a measuring stick for prioritizing capital expenditure in times of economic instability.

AI: That's a great success story - it sounds like the AI partnership really helped you create something valuable that had broader organizational impact.

What made that collaboration particularly effective? Was it the way you structured the brainstorming sessions, or something about how the AI helped you think through the complexity of different manufacturing environments?

User: If the effectiveness of the AI models to remember elements of the conversation to build new ideas off of. If you ask a model to define 10 criteria and then eliminate 8 of those criteria for definable reasons, a model that provides those same 10 criteria as additional considerations isn't an effective thought partner.

AI: That's a really important point about conversational memory and building on previous discussion. It sounds like the AI's ability to track what you'd already ruled out and why was crucial for making real progress.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: If my sole job were to define maintenance strategies, development and improvement of AI systems would be quick to eliminate the need for my role. However, reliability engineering is meant to influence alignment with organization leadership and work process management and provides a fundamental pillar for assuring continued success in maintenance and operations. Execution of work is still such a human-driven element of the maintenance work that the involvement of AI to help generate the strategy only accelerates the time it takes to effectively engage the strategy to later identify more optimization opportunities.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're seeing AI as accelerating the strategic development so you can focus more on the human-centered execution and organizational alignment aspects.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops or as your organization becomes more comfortable with it?

User: Based on my current role, I can't imagine much changing. AI can be such a versatile brainstorming partner that using it solely as a sounding board for new ideas, or to provide new ideas when improvement has stalled, provides tremendous value.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you surface blind spots and alternative approaches that might not come from traditional expertise alone, and your nuanced view of where human accountability remains essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think this conversation highlighted the specific nature of how AI has influenced my daily activities.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic thinking partner while maintaining human oversight for accountability have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to understand how you've found that sweet spot between leveraging AI's capabilities for brainstorming and idea generation while preserving the human expertise needed for contextual understanding and organizational responsibility. 

Have a great rest of your day!
