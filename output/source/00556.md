Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, good to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a DevOps engineer working within a financial services company in the UK. The company has enabled both Microsoft copilot and GitHub copilot within the enterprise and it's something we're slowly making use of.

I primarily use copilot for doing repetitive work e.g. updating data sets, replacing references in codebases and producing boilerplate code. I use copilot within Visual Studio Code and will use it in both agent and ask mode.

I've also enabled features within GitHub like AI PR reviews, it's generally only used as a 'backup' to actual reviews by human engineers to catch any little things that have been missed.

AI: That's really helpful context - thank you. It sounds like you're using AI as both a coding assistant and a review tool.

When you mention using copilot in "agent and ask mode," could you walk me through what that actually looks like in practice? How do you decide which mode to use for different situations?

User: Agent mode in copilot in VS code is used for semi automated code changes. Normally when I have a task to work on that I can easily express in simple language such as renaming variables, adding simple functionality or replacing values like URLs within configurations I would use agent mode to generate the required code changes. I do have issues with this sometimes though as the model seems to struggle with large files and large codebases.

Ask mode is more for having conversations with the model. I'd normally use this for explanations of things like how code works, what could be causing errors or suggestions on how to implement features.

AI: That distinction makes a lot sense - using agent mode for concrete changes and ask mode for explanations and troubleshooting.

You mentioned the model struggling with large files and codebases in agent mode. Tell me more about that - what does that look like when it happens, and how do you handle those situations?

User: Normally these issues happen with very large yaml, json or hcl configuration files. The model will attempt to parse the files and fail because of the size of them. I'd normally suggest changing a smaller subset of the code or breaking it down into smaller steps. Sometimes the model would suggest doing this itself. I have had scenarios where it fails even with smaller changes and in these situations I normally just do the work myself

AI: That's a really practical example of how you adapt when the tool hits its limits. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: For me personally, I normally chose to have copilot perform tasks that are easy to verify the changes to or that I already know how to do. I tend to prefer working on tasks which are new and I don't already have knowledge on. For this kind of task I may use copilot to ask basic questions but I will normally also research them myself to make sure what the model is telling me is correct as I have had issues in the past with suggestions which aren't correct or invalid

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI for tasks you can easily verify while being more cautious with unfamiliar territory.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It really depends on the task, for very large and very repetitive tasks I would normally delegate entirely to copilot and then review once the changes have been made. For smaller tasks and things that aren't as clear cut I tend to use it more collaboratively giving smaller prompts and reviewing as it works

AI: That makes sense - you're tailoring your approach based on the task complexity and your confidence level.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Senior leadership in my workplace is pushing more for the use of AI within the teams. This has influenced my use of AI quite a bit as I have been more sceptical in the past of using it as I don't feel like I can 100% trust AI's work. A lot of my colleagues use AI but I've noticed a recurring pattern of them using it for topics they do not understand which leads to technical documents,  confluence pages and code changes which don't make a lot of sense

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the disconnect between leadership push and practical implementation challenges.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I really felt frustrated with AI was when I was using it to implement some simple changes to a GitHub actions workflow. I was trying to convert some environment variable values within the reusable workflow into workflow inputs. For whatever reason the model really struggled to do this and despite me trying to direct it to do it correctly it continued to make the same errors.

I also had a rather frustrating situation where I was trying to format a comma separated list of GitHub repository names that were on a single line file into separate lines of 10 repository names and rather than actually making the change the model instead put a shell command into the file. It did not matter how I rephrased the prompt, it still continued to make the same error

AI: Those are really concrete examples of when the AI just couldn't grasp what you needed, despite clear direction. It sounds particularly frustrating when it keeps repeating the same mistake.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm very aware that my line of work could be replaced by AI entirely, but I've also spent a lot of time fixing things which were AI generated and did not work correctly. I believe maintaining my skills are important and will remain relevant at least in the short to medium term as AI still is not perfect and continues to need manual intervention

AI: That's a balanced perspective - recognizing both the potential and the current limitations based on your direct experience.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe my use of AI will continue to grow, as models improve I may feel less sceptical of how it well it works and may start using it for more complicated tasks. But as it stands currently I still feel that is a long way away

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed this verification-focused approach - using AI for tasks you can easily check while being more cautious with unfamiliar territory, and how you've observed the pitfalls when colleagues use it for things they don't understand.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I believe that's all

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in DevOps work - from the technical limitations with large files to the workplace dynamics and trust-building process - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and frustrations. Have a great rest of your day!
