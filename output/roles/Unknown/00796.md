Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I don't have any questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work for a research and advisory firm, our clients are tech companies. 1. AI has essentially replaced Google search. 2. I also use it for ideation -- developing hypotheses and building frameworks for financial models that I build. 3. I use it to support writing reports. These reports are public-facing and a very important part of my work. AI doesn't come close to writing them for me, but it can take my bare bones outline and write a very rough, very early draft for me that requires a lot of editing. Vice versa, for my final or near-final writing, AI helps perfect it. For important senses that are tricky to write or are of high importance, I frequently find myself using AI. I use AI for support for important tasks, not automating grunt work, given the nature of my work which is focused on fairly niche research and writing.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as more of a thinking partner rather than just for routine tasks. 

When you mention using AI for ideation and developing hypotheses, can you tell me more about what that interaction looks like? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth, or is there a different way you work through those concepts together?

User: Yes, there are ideas back and forth. I tend to have a vision and share it with them. Sometimes I share "raw data" as well -- the data I use to come to the conclusions, to make AI privy to how I came to my approach. I usually have a 80% there vision and it needs to be refined by AI. The work I produce is expensive and for demanding clients and I take pride in it, so making it better is always helpful. It's a back and forth -- sometimes big picture, sometimes a narrow issue, often a tricky one.

AI: That collaboration sounds quite nuanced. You mentioned that you take pride in your work and it's for demanding clients - I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. 

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones where you do involve AI?

User: Yes. In going through raw data -- qualitative interviews. I like to do that myself because I don't trust AI to find impactful quotes or qualitative nuance. The most valuable qualitative insights could be interrupted -- [impactful sentence] [digression] [impactful sentence]. Plus going through the data slowly myself helps me write the story and build the framework in my mind. To delegate that to AI -- well I wouldn't trust

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like there's something about that direct engagement with the raw qualitative data that's essential for how you develop your understanding and narrative.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it seems like you collaborate throughout tasks rather than just handing something off completely - is that accurate, or does it vary depending on the situation?

User: Yes, it's collaboration for sure. Sometimes I will pose questions in a more aggressive way as if I'm delegating. For example, here's the data what should be the top three findings/insights. But, there will be back and forth.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - starting with what sounds like delegation but then moving into collaboration. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people openly discussing how they use it, or is it more individual experimentation?

User: It's getting more open. Interestingly, at an organization-level, they are intrigued by finding things to delegate. I am interested in collaboration and finding ways to improve the quality of my work by say, 10% and reduce the time to do it by 10%.

AI: That's a fascinating contrast - the organization looking for delegation opportunities while you're focused on enhancement and efficiency gains through collaboration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied when it makes sense of things. I take very extensive, repetitive notes when building hypotheses. So the raw notes are extensive -- overkill -- in developing a roadmap. AI is good at distilling that into a few core points, and said well. I use it for writing and it helps, but its incessant use of the dash to get out of tricky writing situations is frustrating. I like the dash myself but these days I feel like it's a glaring siren that it was written by AI

AI: That's a great observation about the dash becoming an AI tell! It sounds like you've developed a keen eye for AI writing patterns.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do actively consider. My role is very strongly tied to story telling and narrative, published by a team and company with expertise and credibility, and the data analysis as such is pretty basic. So I feel like it will take a bit more time. At least in the near time it would damage my company and its product for it to be done by AI exclusively -- the premise is the conclusions are by experts and they have credibility with decisionmakers in the industry. It's not statistical analysis where AI could quickly find the definitive answer

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on how expertise and credibility factor into your role's resilience. The human judgment and industry standing seem central to the value you provide.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Continuing to use it as collaboration. Improve my writing a bit more. Speed it up perhaps substantially if AI gets better at writing. It writes pretty good fast, but for the highest level business writing that is public-facing, it's definitely not there. But for an undergrad writing a paper -- honestly I don't know how professors are going to deal with it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative thinking partner rather than for automation, and how you're navigating the balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while preserving the human expertise and credibility that's essential to your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Long term I think AI will be a game changer and very disruptive. But companies need to think carefully about how they are leveraging it. Orgs and employees alike need feasible use cases. So it's a paradox, game-changing etc but feasible use cases you need to stick with those and to achieve you need to be thoughtful. I could see org leaders thinking stuff can be done by AI and then fail and it be ruinous for that company. On the other hand, people will be replaced, or I hope just reallocated. I'm optimistic it won't hurt workers. Because if tech was bad for labor, then we never should've invented the wheel. Nevertheless, it could be very very disruptive and bad for workers in cases. Hard to say I guess. Anyway thanks

AI: Thank you so much for sharing that perspective - that tension between AI being potentially game-changing while requiring careful, thoughtful implementation is really insightful. Your point about the need for feasible use cases rather than just assuming AI can handle everything is particularly valuable.

And thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly throughout our conversation. Your insights about collaborative AI use, the importance of human expertise in your field, and the broader organizational challenges will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
