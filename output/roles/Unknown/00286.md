Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I have no other questions at this time.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Yes, I use AI to help write emails, help with communication, keep meeting notes, and other administrative tasks.

AI: That's helpful to know. When you mention using AI for writing emails and communication, can you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: I use AI to help elevate my writing quality and ensure that I am conveying the proper message. I also use it to edit emails and provide suggestions for corrections/clarity.

AI: That makes sense. So it sounds like you're working together with AI on your writing rather than having it write from scratch. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, right now I am working together with AI. I would love to be able to automate some of those more repetitive tasks or emails. I would always like to proof-read before sending emails, but I am okay with any help that AI can provide to help me free up time in my day, without losing the personal touch.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned wanting to maintain that personal touch while still getting help to free up time. 

When you do use AI for these tasks like email writing or meeting notes, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it the full context upfront and let it handle most of the work?

User: For emails, I describe what I want the email to say and with which tone. I then let AI craft the email and I will make any corrections as I see fit before sending it out. For meeting notes, I will let AI handle all of it and I will just proofread before sending it to my team.

AI: That's a clear distinction between how you approach different tasks. It sounds like you give AI more autonomy with meeting notes but stay more involved with email crafting.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We are all relatively new to using AI in the workplace, but are all very excited to see how it can help us automate tasks and to see what other areas it can help us in.

AI: That enthusiasm sounds like it creates a supportive environment for experimentation. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think when AI takes the meeting notes, that is the most satisfying to me, because nothing is lost. Sometimes in a meeting, someone will forget to write something down because they are an active participant, however, AI is just monitoring and taking the notes for us, so nothing is lost. I get frustrated when AI asks too many clarifying questions rather than just providing a quick answer.

AI: That's a great example - I can see how having that reliable documentation would be really valuable, especially when everyone's focused on participating.

You mentioned getting frustrated when AI asks too many clarifying questions. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is not something that I currently consider. I am more concerned about how I can make the experience better, not that I am losing out on any skills.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - focusing on optimization rather than skill preservation. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision the relationship with AI to be evolving at a fast pace. I am anxious to learn as much as I can to help make my workplace as efficient as possible, so that I can focus more on developing relationships with my teammates.

AI: That's a compelling vision - using AI to handle more of the operational work so you can focus on the human connections and relationships.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI meeting notes ensure nothing gets lost when everyone's actively participating.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that is all. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about wanting to maintain that personal touch while automating repetitive tasks, and your focus on using AI to free up time for relationship-building, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you have a great rest of your day!
