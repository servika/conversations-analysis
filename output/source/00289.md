Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do not use AI much. The only times I can recall using AI is when I'm struggling to write something or reword a passage with relevant information.

AI: That's really helpful to know. When you say you're struggling to write something or reword a passage, can you walk me through what that looks like? What kind of writing situations prompt you to turn to AI?

User: When I am going through a research paper to find relevant information, I often need to take a large passage and find a way to present it concisely and clearly in my own work. Sometimes I get stuck with how to phrase this information, and will turn to AI. More commonly, however, I will have a set of key points from my own work that I am struggling to express in a research paper. In this case, I will ask an AI chatbot to explain my own information back to me to check for clarity.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI to check your own clarity by having it explain your work back to you. Can you tell me more about that process? What does that interaction typically look like when you're testing whether your key points come across clearly?

User: I will simply ask the AI to reword my explanation. If the original meaning of my work is retained, this means that my explanation is sufficient. I also draw from the AI's response if I find a better alternative phrasing in it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a clarity check. I'm curious about your preferences when working with writing tasks. Are there certain aspects of writing you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those parts different for you?

User: I find it very easy to write from my work using flow of conscious, meaning that I find AI a little difficult to work with on the flow. I prefer to use AI when this flow stops, meaning I only use it every now and then rather than integrating it with my work. I also find that AI models often lack the knowledge I need when writing a paper at the necessary level.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the flow state being so personal and the knowledge gap at specialized levels. When you do use AI in those moments when your flow stops, how would you describe that interaction? Are you collaborating with it to work through the block, or are you more giving it a specific task to complete while you step back?

User: I more so give it a specific task to complete and step back. Sometimes I'll move on to another piece of work before coming back to the AI response so that I have a clear mind when considering things.

AI: That's really interesting - stepping away and coming back with fresh eyes. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with or differs from what you see around you?

User: Compared to some of my colleagues I use AI very little. However, some don't use it at all. In this sense my usage is quite different. Sometimes I see the good use that my colleagues make of AI in their work, but I find that I struggle to work with it as deeply as them.

AI: Can you tell me more about what you mean when you say you struggle to work with AI as deeply as your colleagues? What does that deeper usage look like when you observe it, and what makes it challenging for you?

User: A few of my colleagues use AI to create large coding projects. I have so far not succeeded in using AI to help with coding and find it easier to write my own code from scratch. In this sense, I find working with AI more challenging

AI: That's a really clear example of the difference. Can you share a time when using AI at work - even in those limited writing situations - made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that moment?

User: A few of these moments have been when I was tired and struggling to work. Being able to outsource some ideas was quite satisfying in this sense. However, I often come back to these the next day and tweak them again, as with anything. I prefer to maintain a mostly constant writing style in my work.

AI: That's a great point about maintaining your writing style. Speaking of maintaining your skills - how do you think about keeping up your abilities in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Whilst I have thought of this, I do not think my abilities are at threat, considering my limited use. However, I worry that learning to use AI when coding could be detrimental to my coding skills.

AI: That concern about coding skills is really thoughtful. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself continuing with this selective approach, or might things change?

User: I think I am unlikely to expand my AI usage much. Where I may use AI more is in a neural network setting where I classify data.

AI: That's interesting - using AI for data classification. That seems like a different kind of application than the writing tasks we've been discussing.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your selective but purposeful approach to AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a clarity check by having it explain your own work back to you - that's such a creative way to test understanding.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really. I need to figure out how AI fits into academia a little more, but this can only happen with time. Things may still change.

AI: That's a really honest reflection - that figuring out AI's place in academia is an ongoing process that will unfold with time. I think that perspective itself is quite valuable.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about selective AI use, maintaining personal flow in writing, and the balance between efficiency and skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
