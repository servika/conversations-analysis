Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No lets start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Mindless calculations, forming excel tables, brainstorming ideas for problem solving

AI: Tell me more about those mindless calculations - what type of work are those part of, and what makes them feel mindless to you?

User: in surveying to establish vertical control monuments we must subtract and add elevations potentially dozens of times, which can be time consuming, and after a long day of physically measuring the observations, workers can be prone to mistakes (adding the wrong sign, for example)

AI: That's really interesting - so the physical fatigue from fieldwork can actually impact the accuracy of your calculations later. 

When you hand those elevation calculations over to AI, how do you typically set that up? Do you give it all the measurements at once, or work through them step by step together?

User: Usually the model understands leveling in surveying, and just requires the data. I usually just upload a photo of my data and allow it to calculate it

AI: That's a clever workflow - just taking a photo of your field notes and letting the AI process it directly. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from something like these calculations?

User: Deciding where control monuments in surveying go can be tricky and usually you may realize you messed up after already establishing the monument. AI could help this by finding optimal positions however, the human eye on the worksite is still much better, as AI does not have up to date satellite imagery, or context of what the survey requirements are for the project

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you need that real-time assessment of the actual site conditions and project-specific requirements that only being there in person can provide.

When you do use AI for work tasks like those calculations, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate the complete calculation work for it to handle independently?

User: i just tell it the procedure (ie. leveling) then provide the data, then just ask for the output, i do not need to work with it through the workflow as it is generally easy calculations and i would quickly understand if something went wrong when seeing the results

AI: So you're essentially handing off the entire calculation process - you trust it to handle the procedure independently and you can spot-check the results quickly based on your experience.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I have not witnessed a single person use AI in my job aside from writing proposals (or bids) for winning new projects

AI: Interesting - so you seem to be ahead of the curve compared to your colleagues when it comes to using AI for field calculations, but others are using it for the business development side.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: After a long day in the sun doing a level loop, i did not want to do calculations and spend anymore time working. This is where i called on AI to do the math in a few seconds, whereas I would take 10+ minutes to work through the whole process, where I could have made errors. I got home earlier, and saved any potential calculation errors so I was satisfied.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI helping you when you really needed it most - when fatigue could lead to mistakes and you just wanted to get home after a tough day in the field.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: i consider it, but like i said, AI still lacks context and up to date data of worksites that surveyors need when completing their work. Surveying also has different rules/regulations/requirements from project to project, city to city, municipality to municipality, and someone would have to correct the AI to solve for these differences. Until AI takes form of robots on the job site, i feel secure in my position, and past that, they will still need a human feeding it context.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you see the technical aspects as something AI can help with, but the contextual judgment and regulatory knowledge as your domain.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: AI can massively reduce data processing time, enabling more work to be completed, but this could potentially make the field more competitive with less jobs. However, this could be good as surveying is an aging profession and younger people are not entering the field.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with the computational work while you maintain the crucial contextual judgment that only comes from being on-site.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I tried to have AI correct a calculation error, but the model could not figure it out, but it still pretended to find errors, which was very frustrating

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the AI confidently claiming to find errors when it actually couldn't identify the real problem. That kind of false confidence could be particularly problematic in your field where accuracy is critical.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for calculations while maintaining human judgment for the contextual work, and especially that example about false confidence in error-checking, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: you're welcome, is that all?

AI: Yes, that's all! Thank you so much for participating in this interview. Your insights have been really helpful for our research. Have a great rest of your day!
