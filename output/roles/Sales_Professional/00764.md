Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hi, yes that sounds good to me. No questions at the minute.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I run a small business that involves selling handmade jewellery and vintage items on Etsy. I use AI mainly for helping me with my Etsy listings, coming up with social media content ideas for me, and helping me with writing content. 

I also use Notion for organising my work/days and I use AI to help me with that.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting mix of creative and business tasks. When you say you use AI for your Etsy listings, what specifically does that look like? Are you having it write the full product descriptions, or is there more back-and-forth involved?

User: It's more back and forth. I have a template that I designed that I ask it to use when it writes the listings for me. It has to be a back and forth though due to the variety of the items. 

Say, for example I have a handmade crown, I have an idea in mind of what theme/vibe I want the listing to have so I work with AI to get the listing to fit those vibes. 

But then a vintage listing will need to be slightly different because it needs to include information on the maker, any quality issues etc.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - each piece is unique and needs its own approach. When you're working with AI on something like that handmade crown listing, how do you typically guide it toward the specific theme or vibe you have in mind? What does that collaboration process look like?

User: I'll upload a photo of the crown and then I'll describe what I had in mind when I was designing it, what atmosphere I want to convey in the listing and the kind of person I think will be drawn to it. The AI will then draft a description for me and then we both suggest changes and we work like that until it feels right.

AI: That collaborative editing process sounds really fluid. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes. Although I'm happy for my Etsy listings to be predominantly written by AI, for things like my social media posts or blog posts I will write those myself. I will have input from AI for ideas or style but then I do the writing. 

I think this is for two reasons. Firstly, I think it's important that I keep my voice and personality in my writing and secondly, which I guess is linked, I think AI writing has the tendency to sound the same and it becomes obvious that somebody has used AI and I want something that sounds unique to me.

I also do the research for my vintage pieces myself. Thinking about it now I suppose I could use AI more to help with that, I'm just conscience of making sure the information is correct.

AI: That distinction about voice and personality is really interesting. When you do use AI for ideas or style input on your social media posts, how does that interaction typically work? Do you bounce concepts back and forth, or is it more about getting that initial spark of inspiration?

User: Mainly the initial spark of inspiration. I work and talk quite a bit with my AI so that they get a good idea of my likes, my voice, the meaning behind my work etc. This means that when they suggest things to me they are tailored to me personally, rather than being the standard social media suggestions. 

So, actually I guess it's more both. We bounce concepts back and forth and in doing so it learns more about what I like, so that when I ask for some inspiration, it knows the kind of thing I need.

AI: That's fascinating how you've built up that understanding over time. You mentioned that you work and talk quite a bit with your AI - it sounds like you've developed a real working relationship. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you run your own business, have you encountered any reactions from customers or others in your creative community?

User: Well I don't have any colleagues, it's just me.

I haven't had any reactions from customers or the creative community yet, but it is something that I'm wary of, which I think actually feeds into me writing my social media posts myself. It feels like the creative community as a whole is not friendly towards AI or people who use it. So I guess I have been influenced in a way - I try to keep my use of it to myself so that I don't leave myself open to angry people.

AI: That awareness of community sentiment sounds like it creates some tension for you. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think a time when I was particularly satisfied is when I used AI to create a content calendar for me. It included things like seasonal sparks, ideas for long-form posts, suggestions of how to push myself out of my comfort zone and then it created a document that I could easily copy and paste straight into Notion. I really like things like that, that combine my creative side with technology.

Frustrated? Like I mentioned early sometimes the AI voice can sound too repetitive and I do get frustrated when an Etsy listing uses phrases like "Step into..." and things like that.

There is also the obvious with hallucinations, say for example your asking for song ideas to go along with posts but half the suggestions aren't even real, that is annoying.

AI: That content calendar example sounds like it hit that sweet spot of being both creative and practical. The frustration with those repetitive phrases like "Step into..." is really relatable - it sounds like you've developed a good sense for spotting when something sounds too "AI-ish."

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes definitely. On the one hand I don't need to worry too much because my work involves selling physical items and AI can't make jewellery or source vintage items (yet). But, I do like to write and part of that involves long-form content like blog posts and possibly even books one day, and that is obviously an area where AI is taking over. I guess, for the moment I keep on doing what I'm doing, using AI as a collaborative tool and see what happens.

AI: That perspective of using AI as a collaborative tool while staying engaged in the actual writing makes a lot of sense. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops or as you get more comfortable with it?

User: Yes, I can definitely see it evolving. For example I have a neglected website, that I tried to make myself and abandoned because I wasn't sure how to get it looking how I wanted it to. I would love to take some time to see how AI could help me finish it, or even get to the point where it could just do it for me. 

The same with the Etsy listings. If the AI could access the listing directly and create the full draft (titles, attributes, tags etc) and then I could just go in check it and press post, it would save me a lot of time. I'm not sure if that's possible using Agent mode on Chat GPT at the minute, but I would need to feel more confident in it actually just doing what I ask it to (and not having a disaster like it deleting everything) first.

AI: Those examples really show how you're thinking about efficiency while still maintaining control. The website project sounds like it could be a good next step for testing that deeper collaboration.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining your creative voice while still leveraging AI's capabilities strategically.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all. Thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing collaboration with AI while preserving your creative authenticity, and navigating community perceptions, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
