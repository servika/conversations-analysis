Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently we use AI in my department as a way to ask "plain-speak" questions into a knowledge base and have AI parse the answer out. There are other applications as well but this is how it is currently being implemented into the department. Myself personally, I use it for when I'm in the brainstorming stages of a project. I like to bounce ideas off of AI to help me collect my thoughts.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're experiencing AI in two different ways at work. 

Tell me more about that brainstorming process when you're bouncing ideas off of AI. What does that interaction typically look like for you?

User: So, it's usually in the planning stage of a project. When I am trying to write something. AI is great at helping you glue together a bunch of thoughts or concepts into a cohesive plan.

AI: That makes sense - using AI as a way to organize and connect your thinking. 

When you're in that planning stage, how do you typically work with AI? Are you feeding it all your scattered thoughts at once, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation where you're building the plan together?

User: Great question. I'd say it's mostly me feeding the thoughts all at once and having it spit something out. I then will suggest fine tune adjustments.

AI: So you're giving it the raw material upfront and then refining what comes back. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are things that I enjoy doing and want to stay current with, such as data analysis via excel or creating custom tools for a process. I know AI probably would be servcible but I'd have to audit the work and I enjoy doing stuff like that, so I don't mind at all.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - the enjoyment factor and wanting to stay current with those skills.

When you mention having to audit AI's work on things like data analysis, what goes through your mind about that? Is it the extra step that makes it less appealing, or something else about that process?

User: Well, AI still makes too many mistakes and errors to be completely relied upon. So, I think that is a part of it

AI: That concern about reliability makes a lot of sense, especially when accuracy is critical.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the department's approach to that knowledge base system shaped how you think about using AI more broadly?

User: I work with very tech savvy folks so I think we are probably more comfortable with the ever changing nature of technology and AI fits into that. I think AI is really good at extracting information from a knowledge base so I think as people settle into that workflow and see how it saves them time and frustration it makes it more likely for others to integrate that into their own workflows

AI: It sounds like having tech-savvy colleagues creates an environment where people are more willing to experiment and adapt. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yeah, happy to help with that. We were looking for a specific piece of information as part of a risk management investigation. Without disclosing any real specifics, it became important for us to go through several technical documents and legal documents over a misused regulated feature by a customer. We needed to make sure it was explicitly outlined somewhere and AI was able to locate it much more efficiently. That was a big time saver.

AI: That sounds like a really impactful use case - finding that needle in the haystack across multiple complex documents when accuracy and thoroughness were critical.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Oh absolutely. I know that AI can do a lot of coding and data analysis but it's important to stay current. Having experience is needed. AI can fail and over reliance can put you in a bad spot if you don't keep current on skills.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - staying current as a safety net against over-reliance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It's being integrated a lot. I know that we are using it in a lot of different ways. AI training has seemingly exploded at my company over the past year

AI: It sounds like your company is really investing in AI adoption across the board.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining skills as a hedge against over-reliance - that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while staying sharp on core competencies.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: My work has both internal and external customers. I think that we are seeing a faster growth of AI usage and adoption with internal folks. To a lot of external customers, its still a buzzy curiosity.

AI: That's a really valuable observation - the difference in adoption rates between internal and external customers. That distinction between seeing it as a practical tool versus a "buzzy curiosity" is quite telling about where we are in the adoption curve.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from brainstorming workflows to skill maintenance to that internal-external adoption gap will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: You're welcome!

AI: Thank you so much! Have a great rest of your day.
