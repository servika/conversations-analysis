Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No that sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a freelance writer so I use it for a TON of stuff. I do my own writing, but I use AI to generate outlines for longer work. Sometimes I'll feed it my work and ask for feedback.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your writing process. 

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI to generate outlines? What do you give it to work with, and how do you use what it creates?

User: I recently had a project where I was making client education products for a veterinary medical supply company. So I asked my AI to create an outline for an information sheet for vaccines. This is what it returned:**  Vaccine Name & Purpose:** What the vaccine is called and what disease it prevents.
* **How It Works:** A simple explanation of the vaccine's mechanism.
* **Who Should Get It:** The recommended age group or population.
* **What to Expect:** A list of common side effects and what to do if they occur.
* **Serious Side Effects:** Information on rare, more severe reactions and when to seek medical help.
* **Vaccination Schedule:** The number of doses and timing for each.
* **Additional Resources:** Where to find more information.

AI: That outline looks quite comprehensive and well-structured for your veterinary client. 

Tell me more about what happened next - how did you work with that outline? Did you use it as-is, or did you modify it before writing the actual information sheet?

User: It was really helpful, I copied the outline into a document and was able to create a template for their entire series of vaccines. I took out the word "serious" and included both minor and more serious side effects in subsections.

AI: That's a smart adaptation - creating a template from the AI's work that you could then apply across the whole vaccine series. It sounds like you took what the AI generated and refined it to better fit your client's specific needs.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to do the actual writing myself - partly because I enjoy it, but also because I know that AI isn't always correct. I use AI for the planning any myself for the execution.

AI: That's a clear distinction you've drawn - using AI for planning but handling the execution yourself. 

What is it about the actual writing that makes you want to keep that for yourself? You mentioned enjoying it, but also concerns about AI accuracy - can you tell me more about how those factors play into your decision?

User: A lot of my writing is informational - client materials, employee handbooks, other business materials. If anything is incorrect, it makes me look bad and I could lose a long-term client. I'm not taking that risk. AI is really good at predictive text, but isn't always factually correct and makes up things when it doesn't know the answer. My clients trust me and I value that.

AI: That makes complete sense - your reputation and client relationships are clearly central to your business. The trust factor you mentioned is really important.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually just ask for an outline. Sometimes I ask about what's included, or ask if something else would fit in. For example, one of my services is ghostwriting. I just updated the google form that I send out to potential new clients. When they contact me and ask about my ghostwriting services, I send the form out to get a better idea of what they are looking for - length, subject, amount of involvement, budget, etc. I sent a list of my old questions and asked the AI to make them better. It then sent me some updated questions that I mostly liked, although I tweaked a couple of the suggestions. Then, I sent those back to the AI and asked if it had any suggestions about grouping or ordering the questions differently, and it gave me some ideas for making the questions flow more logically.

AI: That's a fascinating example of iterative collaboration - you're essentially having a back-and-forth conversation with the AI to refine your work. It sounds like you used it as a thinking partner to improve both the content and structure of your form.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? As a freelancer, I'm curious how you navigate the broader conversations around AI use with clients or other writers.

User: A lot of writers hate AI, and I get that. There are a lot of people who use AI and then call themselves writers, a lot of really bad content that's getting put on the internet. But I think that AI is a tool, just like a thesaurus or a graphic organizer.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - viewing AI as one tool among many rather than a replacement for your skills. It sounds like you've found a way to integrate it that feels authentic to your work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't really think of anything. It wasn't work related, but I was trying to remember the name of a movie once and the model was STUPID and kept telling me things that were untrue. But it wasn't important.

AI: That's actually helpful to hear - both that your work interactions with AI have been relatively smooth, and that example of frustration when it couldn't accurately help you recall something specific.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As a writer, I love that a lot of the tedious background work can be handled by AI. In any industry, things change and you have to adapt. I've been writing marketing content for over 20 years, and social media wasn't a thing when I started. I didn't rant about social media destroying my job, I learned to use hashtags and images to create marketing materials.

AI: That's a really pragmatic view - seeing AI as part of the natural evolution of your field, similar to how social media changed marketing. Your 20 years of experience clearly gives you perspective on how the industry adapts.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I like how it is starting to integrate with other platforms. Like I use G-suite for everything, and when I went to create my final questionnaire I just had to start a new google form and tell it which of my google docs had the questions and it made me a form. I also like that it can help me with some research into trends - I don't totally trust it because I know the models have a good many factuality errors still, but it gives me a good starting point.

AI: That integration with tools you already use sounds really convenient - having AI work within your existing workflow rather than requiring you to switch platforms.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on viewing AI as just another tool that's evolved alongside your industry, like social media did years ago.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thanks. That was fun!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about how you've integrated AI into your freelance writing practice - especially that balance between leveraging it for planning while maintaining control over execution - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the benefits and your approach to managing the risks. Have a great rest of your day!
