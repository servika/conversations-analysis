Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready, thanks

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in marketing and use it frequently in helping me come up with ideas and refining the first or second draft of written content. For example, I was creating a brand guide for my firm to use that would guide them through the rebranding. It was more than 20 pages and I needed help explaining why and how certain elements needed to be executed a certain way. I also use it to help me conduct preliminary market research and test basic ideas.

AI: That sounds like AI is playing a pretty substantial role in your creative process. When you mention using it for preliminary market research and testing basic ideas - can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically approach those interactions?

User: For example, right now I'm working to help us develop a new product. I use AI to help me identify what competitors are doing in that space and what they've created. I also use it to help me come up with strategies to sell and present the product. I can't use it much past preliminary stages right now because I don't want to put any sensitive company information on there

AI: That's really interesting - you've drawn a clear line around sensitive information. Tell me more about that. How do you decide what crosses that threshold from preliminary research into information you won't share with AI?

User: Obviously, I'm not using any PPI or identifiable information that could be connected to a specific contact or client in our system. We work in financial services and sell research so I don't get specific on that information. For example, in the new product we're creating, our drafts include research. I use AI to help me come up with layout ideas, but I'm not inputting a draft of what we've created and ask for feedback. It would be faster if I could do that but it's too private at this point.

AI: That makes a lot of sense given your industry. So you're finding creative ways to get value from AI while staying within those boundaries - using it for layout ideas rather than feeding it the actual content drafts.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Are you talking about personal preference and what I enjoy doing? Or AI's value given the nature of the task?

AI: That's a great clarification question - I'm interested in your personal preferences. What are the tasks where you think "I could ask AI to help with this, but I'd rather do it myself"? What drives that choice for you?

User: That's a good question. Typically I find value in using AI regardless of the task I'm working on. I don't use it more because of privacy concerns but I would like to implement it more. Since I work in marketing, I have a lot of routine tasks that would be great to automate with some prompt engineering. I think it's just a matter of my company implementing those workflows. I also value it in the creative process because it generates many examples quickly and I can then decide why certain variations work and why others don't. When it comes to final execution of creative content I would prefer to do that myself because I don't think AI can handle that yet for my use case. In the future it would be so helpful to have an AI checker go over my creative work and help me fix small details/errors that I don't see at first. So if I would summarize - I would say in final decision making I'm not going to use AI. But I can see it having value in the first 75% of tasks I'm completing.

AI: That's a fascinating way to think about it - AI handling the first 75% but you taking over for final decision making and execution. 

When you're in that collaborative phase - say you're using AI to generate those creative examples - could you describe how that interaction typically unfolds? Are you going back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you more often ask it to generate a batch of options and then you take it from there?

User: I do both

AI: Tell me more about that. When do you find yourself going back and forth versus taking a batch approach?

User: I'll go back and forth when I'm close to finishing something. For example, I have a text that's a few paragraphs that I wrote myself and feel good about. I use AI to refine it and we go back and forth until it's complete. I use batch approach when I'm early in the brainstorming/iteration process and I need to consider many approaches at once. This could be for something like creating a marketing/ad campaign from scratch.

AI: That's really insightful - you're essentially using different collaboration patterns depending on where you are in the creative process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: I work at a smaller company that is not quick to adapt AI. Younger people at the firm use AI for a few tasks, but I am one of the most frequent users. I try to get my firm to adopt to it but many people are resistant.

AI: What kind of resistance are you encountering? What do you think is driving that hesitation from your colleagues?

User: People do not see how it can improve their workflows and they feel that AI tools available are too nascent to be effective.

AI: Given that you're one of the more frequent users while working in that environment, can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure, I can give you an example of both. One time I became frustrated because I needed AI to help me analyze some data. I thought that the way the data was presented was obvious but the AI kept making errors. It took about 30 minutes of prompt engineering for it to produce the output I wanted. That was frustrating because it was just counting sums and grouping lists. It wasn't complicated. It was especially annoying because I also had to spend time anonymizing the data (to eliminate PPI) which added to the amount of time. One time that I was very satisfied was when I was helping a colleague create content for one of our external publications. It was on an area in finance that I am not very familiar with. When I explained generally what I was looking for, the AI produced super helpful resources. I then used those as my baseline. It cut down my time on that task by hours I'd say.

AI: Those are really telling examples - the frustration with what should have been straightforward data analysis versus the satisfaction when AI opened up knowledge in an unfamiliar domain. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I hear all the time about how AI will take over marketing but I am not worried about it. I enjoy strategy and creation, both of which need a lot of human input. AI will (hopefully) be developed so  I can spend less time on boring tasks like basic analysis of our marketing efforts, data entry/presentation, and competitor research. I do worry about its effect on entry level jobs. I am at the manager level so it will only augment my career. Additionally I would say that I feel that it is important that people learn 1) how to prompt engineer and 2) how to use Python. I know how to prompt engineer well and as I am learning Python, I see how I can work more efficiently

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as potentially freeing you up from the routine work to focus more on strategy and creation. You mentioned learning Python alongside prompt engineering as important skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What changes do you anticipate?

User: I anticipate that I will continue to use it even more. We have a basic AI guidance policy in place but nothing specific. Ideally I would like an AI tool that is trained specifically to my company and my role so I can work faster and not have to anonymize information every time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI for different phases of the creative process - that 75% collaboration model and how you shift between batch and iterative approaches.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all from me. Thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating privacy constraints while still finding creative ways to leverage AI, and your thoughts on how it fits into different stages of your workflow, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
