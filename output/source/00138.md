Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm good.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a paralegal, I track changes to state and federal laws and regulations for management and create weekly summaries.

AI: That sounds like a job that requires staying on top of a lot of moving pieces. When you're tracking those legal changes and creating your weekly summaries, how does AI help you with that work?

User: I use OpenAI to scan provided text for keywords related to banking and finance and list anything related.  Also summarize the key provisions.

AI: So you're using AI to help identify relevant content and then summarize the key points. When you're doing this scanning and summarizing work, do you feed the AI the full text of laws and regulations, or are you working with smaller chunks of information?

User: A mixture, smaller chunks that are provided by free news sources such as newsletters I have subscribed to from law firms and banking industry organizations. Also daily published federal registers and also government announcements and publications.

AI: That's a lot of different sources to keep track of. When you're working with AI on these materials - whether it's the newsletters, federal registers, or government publications - how do you typically interact with it? Do you collaborate with the AI throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: I give it a complete task that I reuse.

AI: Tell me more about that reusable task. What does that process look like for you day-to-day?

User: I provide the same prompt to maintain consistency and get the information back in the correct format.

AI: That makes sense for maintaining consistency. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your legal tracking work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I review the information myself in case there are any obvious hallucinations. I will spot check and confirm anything that appears incomplete.

AI: So you're maintaining oversight over the AI's work. When you do spot those hallucinations or incomplete information, what happens next? How do you handle those situations?

User: Then you must go back to the original source material and perform a visual comparison.

AI: That verification step sounds crucial for your work. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your legal research and tracking?

User: I work very independently so how I perform my role is entirely up to me. As long as the work in accurate. I work for a company that is not very technologically advanced, you can say old school, so my talents are appreciated.

AI: It sounds like you have quite a bit of autonomy in how you approach your work. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My AI assisted reports are always well received by management, and they are impressed with the detailed information. It makes me appear very competent and using my time efficiently.

AI: That's great to hear that your reports are so well received. On the flip side, have you experienced any moments of frustration when working with AI, or has it been mostly positive for you?

User: Mostly positive, but AI isn't perfect and I occasionally have to edit the information.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do not worry about that, as AI cannot replace my 35 years of experience. There are things that must be learned over time, and not just  fact based.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing much from how you use it now?

User: I think as I get more familiar with it, I assume I will find more ways to use it to help me. Such as reviewing loan documents for errors. But for now I don't have that level of confidence.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your 35 years of experience gives you confidence that AI is a tool rather than a replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining oversight while leveraging AI's efficiency, and how your experience helps you use it as a complementary tool, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
