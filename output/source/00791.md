Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a web designer for a marketing agency. We are a small business, so my role is diverse. I use AI to create social media posts, write content for my web pages, optimize SEO keywords, write php for customized web pages, fill in backgrounds for images when they aren't cropped the way I need them to be, rewrite my emails for me so that people not in my industry can understand what I'm trying to say, and more

AI: That's quite a range of tasks! It sounds like AI has become integrated across many different aspects of your work.

When you mention using AI for all these different functions - from writing PHP code to filling in image backgrounds to rewriting emails - how does that typically work for you? Do you find yourself working back and forth with the AI on these tasks, or do you more often give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: For writing/rewriting tasks I usually have to tweak it afterward. Usually I will ask it to do several rewrites on its own and then once I'm happy with it I go in and rewrite it to my standards. I find AI has a very distinct voice and doesn't understand the nuance of what my company does or the industry I am creating content for, but it is a great starting point and makes my life easier because I don't have to think so hard to get a writing task started. This saves me a lot of time.

The PHP code writing has been a game changer for me because I only understand a little PHP, so having AI write it has made it so I am better able to customize web pages to my clients needs.

The image generation can be tricky. I use the one built in to Adobe Photoshop, and for extending images it usually works really well, but for building upon/creating/changing actual content within the image it is pretty hit or miss.

I take a pretty hands on role mostly when working with AI.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed different working relationships with AI depending on the task type.

I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about PHP coding being a "game changer" since you only know a little PHP yourself. When you use AI for that coding work, how do you feel about potentially not developing those PHP skills further? Is that something you think about, or does the ability to deliver better results for your clients outweigh that consideration?

User: I wasn't planning on learning PHP in my current role, so this has opened doors for me. I wouldn't say I'm opposed to learning it. If the opportunity presented itself I would absolutely learn it for myself and most likely still use AI to help me save time writing it in the future. Right now that is not a necessary goal for me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like AI actually expanded what you can offer rather than replacing something you were already planning to develop.

I'm curious about the other side of your work. You mentioned there are tasks where you prefer to handle things yourself and then polish what AI produces. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: When I work with extremely specialized clients it's better for me to write content myself because it is too niche for AI to grasp the understanding. For example I work with an industrial printer company, but there isn't much info online about their products because it is very niche and B2B. A lot of times even with reference material AI doesn't understand what is important, how to make it relatable to the customer base, etc. I also prefer to do some of the graphic design elements myself, like icon and small graphic creation so I can add my own flare and consistency among elements. We also like to make sure we're not relying too heavily on AI because we are a creative company and we understand the importance of the human touch.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - especially the balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining that human creative touch.

You mentioned that your company is mindful about not relying too heavily on AI because you're a creative company. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been discussion about guidelines or boundaries around AI use?

User: We have had discussions with clients about how much AI is to be used, some clients actually prefer more AI because there is a bit of hype around its SEO keyword use abilities. My boss especially doesn't want AI used from our graphic design department or our media department. For those of us on my team in the web department we are allowed to use it at our own discretion.

AI: That's interesting how different departments have different approaches, and that client preferences are also part of the conversation.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have been more frustrated lately, especially with ChatGPT as it seems to be getting worse. The language is very stilted and similar for everything, even with prompting about using/not using specific characters, tone, context, etc. I can also tell sometimes ChatGPT has a day or two where it is useless and can't seem to follow basic tasks. My own reliance on AI bites me in the butt on those occasions. Overall across all AI models, the ability to follow directions is my biggest paint point.

For being satisfied, I do love how much time it saves me and how much more it opens me creatively with my ability to create web pages. I have been really excited with out things have been turning out lately.

AI: That's a great point about the reliability inconsistency - having those "off days" when you're relying on it must be particularly frustrating.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think the way you use it will change as the technology develops, or as your own comfort level with it changes?

User: I will always be cautious around it since I see how often it can't follow simple instructions. I would like to continue using it around the same level I have been. If new technology comes out that I couldn't predict and it is helpful I absolutely would integrate it into my work life.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has opened creative doors for you with web customization while you maintain that careful balance with the human creative touch your company values.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thank you very much.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from the reliability challenges to how AI has expanded your capabilities with PHP coding will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
