Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use it when I have a blockage. Instead of wasting time figuring out the pros and cons, I ask the AI for advice to see if I've missed anything.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a way to work through mental blocks. Can you tell me more about what those blockages typically look like for you? What kind of situations prompt you to turn to AI for that advice?

User: I'm a software developer, so those blockages are usually related to how to implement a design or system.

AI: Tell me more about that. When you hit one of those implementation blockages, what does your conversation with AI typically look like? Do you describe the whole problem, or focus on specific parts you're stuck on?

User: I usually provide the project context, my problem and sometimes solutions I've tried and how they failed.

AI: When AI gives you that advice and helps you see what you might have missed, what happens next? Do you typically take those suggestions and run with them, or do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI as you work through the implementation?

User: I compare its solutions with my own and decide on the best solution with its new insight. If it doesn't give useful insight, I push forth until I come to a conclusion. I don't typically ask it to generate an implementation.

AI: That's a clear approach - using AI for the analysis and insight, but keeping the actual implementation work for yourself. I'm curious about that boundary you've drawn. Are there other types of development tasks where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help?

User: Code tests for sure

AI: What is it about code tests that makes you want to handle those yourself? What's different about that task compared to getting advice on design problems?

User: Code tests require understanding and goals of the project as a whole which cannot be fully conveyed to the AI. The AI would simply look at my code and make sure everything it already runs will keep running as is, even if those include mistakes and errors.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you need that deeper project understanding to write meaningful tests. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team have similar approaches, or have you seen different patterns?

User: I'm the only developer on the team. Other members are on the creative team, which aren't fond of AI.

AI: Interesting dynamic - being the sole developer while working with a creative team that's not fond of AI. How does that difference in perspective affect how you approach or talk about your AI usage at work?

User: It doesn't affect me much.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently, I've been needing mock textures to integrate into the project. Instead of waiting on the creative team or drawing placeholders myself, I was hoping AI could generate image placeholders and edit them to the project's needs, but it could not. I tried several different AI with image manipulation capabilities but none worked.

AI: That sounds frustrating - having a clear use case in mind but hitting those limitations. When you couldn't get the AI to handle the texture work, what did you end up doing instead? And how did that experience shape how you think about where AI can and can't help you?

User: Well that's where I am at right now. I'll give up on having the AI do it and I'll have to create those placeholders myself later today. This made me think AI isn't quite good at image manipulation yet.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I love coding and I will keep coding even if people are trying to replace that skill with AI.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'll be learning to rely on it a little more to help assist me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that boundary between using AI for insight versus implementation, and how you think about testing requiring that deeper project understanding that's hard to convey.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a thinking partner for design decisions while maintaining ownership of implementation and testing will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
