Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yes sounds good, no quesions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me with my writing tasks as I am a freelance writer and SEO specialist. At the moment I use AI to help me write product descriptions, blog posts and SEO enriched website content.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your writing workflow. 

When you're working on those product descriptions, blog posts, and SEO content, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you and the AI work together on these projects?

User: I need to be very specific with instructions. For example for product descriptions I give the tone of voice and branding information, what needs to be included and length requirements etc. Then the AI repeats this back to me. Then I give it a product name and the information about the product and it writes a description. I then have to go through a few turns per description to stop the AI writing AI favoured words or sentence structures and tenses. Then I need to edit myself to make it sound like a human wrote it so Google doesn't penalise the website. With blog posts I do the research myself and then feed the information to the AI and tell it to write a post about the information, giving it styling and tone instructions. I then need to make adjustments and add commands such as telling it not to fabricate information. For SEO content * do my own key word research as the AI's are not so good at this. I then write the gist of what I need and the keywords and get the AI to incorporate the kjeywords naturrally into my content.*

AI: That's a really detailed picture of your process - it sounds like you've developed quite a systematic approach through experience. 

You mentioned having to go through several rounds to stop the AI from using "AI favoured words or sentence structures and tenses." Tell me more about that - what does that editing process look like for you?

User: So the AI usually uses words and phrases such as "moreover" , "add a touch of timeless style", "versitile" and others. It tends to finish product descriptions with a sentence such as "whether you're hosting friends or enjoying alone time, this sofa brings warmth, and comfort to your space". It usually starts sentences with a verb. It also uses complex sentences with an introductory participial phrase followed by an independent clause. It makes it easy to tell that it is AI produced, so when Google crawls the website it penalises it. The AI normally defaults to this, and when I tell it not to, after a few turns it goes back to doing it.

AI: That's fascinating - you've really identified specific patterns in how AI writes. It sounds like you're constantly battling against the AI reverting to those default patterns even after you've given it corrections.

When you're doing that back-and-forth to get the AI to stop using those phrases and structures, how does that feel in the moment? What's going through your mind during those rounds of corrections?

User: It is actually really frustrating because I get paid by the word and not by the hour. The longer it takes to get a small piece of writing correct, the less I am getting paid.

AI: That sounds genuinely stressful - having your income directly tied to efficiency while dealing with those repetitive correction cycles. 

Given that frustration with the back-and-forth, are there any writing tasks where you've decided it's actually faster or better to just do the work yourself from the start? What makes you choose one approach over the other?

User: Yes, sometimes SEO writing is easier to do myself. This way I dont need to fact check everything and can write in a way that Google likes when it crawls the website.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - cutting out the fact-checking step and having direct control over the SEO optimization.

I'm curious about your colleagues or other freelance writers you might know. How have they influenced the way you use AI in your work, or have you noticed any workplace culture around AI use in your field?

User: I think there are writers that have defaulted to using AI and are lazy. There is also the issue that companies are defaulting to AI rather than using freelance writers. The issue is Google is getting clever at realising how AI writes and penalising websites with predominantly AI generated content. This results in the website not ranking as well and damages the SEO. Then writers like me are being re-employed to repeat the work.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're seeing a cycle where AI adoption initially displaces writers, but then quality and SEO issues bring human expertise back into demand.

Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation that made it stand out?

User: I wanted a blog post about different types of nurseries - including Montesori, EYFS and Steiner. The AI kept including examples but when I fact checked I could not find this information. When I queried the AI it told me it made them up. But I had to query every fact individually and even get it to start over. This is frustrating.

AI: That sounds incredibly time-consuming and frustrating - having to fact-check every detail individually and then discover the AI was fabricating information. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you navigate your work?

User: I dont think AI will ever be able to fully take over my job. There are writers who use it primarily and produce sub par work, but if you want quality SEO optimized text then a human writer is the onyl option. I think it will be more AI being used by quality writers as an aide or for ideas. Therefore I will maintain my skills.

AI: That's a confident perspective - viewing AI as a tool that enhances quality work rather than replaces it entirely.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use these tools as they develop or as you get more experience with them?

User: I am hoping they will develop to the extent that I can give them a brief and they are able to produce the work I want from the content I give them. I would also like to see AI images improve as sometimes I try to use these for some of the websites I work on and they are obviously AI generated. Sometimes it is very difficult to get AI to make an image of what I want.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed specific techniques to combat AI's writing patterns and your view of AI as a tool that enhances rather than replaces quality writing work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Maybe just the image generation.

AI: Tell me more about that - what's your experience been like with AI image generation in your work?

User: So for instance I asked for an image of three children in a living room. One is sat at a table drawing, one is watering plants on the windowsill and the third is dancing with a ribbon. The AI gave me an image of a child drawing at a table with another child watering them with a watering can. Then an image of a child producing water from their hand onto a table.

AI: That's a perfect example of how AI can completely misinterpret what seems like straightforward instructions! It sounds like the AI struggled to understand the separate, simultaneous actions you wanted depicted.

When you get results like that, does it affect how much time you can realistically budget for projects that need images, similar to how the writing corrections impact your per-word income?

User: Yes, again it is annoying because I will quote for the website work and then simple things like finding images are taking far too long, which means I again get paid less due to the time it takes.

AI: That really paints a clear picture of how these AI limitations are directly impacting your bottom line across multiple aspects of your work.

Thank you so much for sharing all of these insights with me today. Your experiences really highlight both the potential and the current limitations of AI tools in professional writing work. The specific examples you've given - from the fabricated nursery information to the misinterpreted image requests - will be incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your time and how openly you've shared your experiences. This has been very helpful.

User: no problem. Are we done?

AI: Yes, we're all done! Thank you again for your time and insights - this was really valuable for our research.
