Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm with Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds Good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: We do not use AI at work for general duties. The staff will at times research competitors or client issues.

AI: Tell me more about that research work. When you or your staff research competitors or client issues using AI, what does that process typically look like?

User: Price comparisons are done against the competition. We will, once in a while, research a client if we have reason to believe that the customer will be unable to uphold their end of the contract for specific reasons. For example: incarceration, death or other extreme situations.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI for due diligence on both the competitive landscape and client verification. When you're doing these price comparisons against competition, how do you typically go about that research with AI? What information are you looking for?

User: We are looking for discounts, promotions and average monthly pricing.

AI: How do you find AI performs for gathering that pricing information compared to other methods you might have used before? Does it give you what you need, or do you find yourself having to verify or supplement what it provides?

User: AI will speed up the process of filtering out the competitors we don't need to be concerned with since all are grouped in one place. Once we have the information we can then refine it by asking for an overview from reviews of the most relevant competitors. From there we can assess what people are saying is most important to them, and what works or doesn't work for them, providing us with the opportunity to fill any gaps in what is being offered in the industry. We will visit the websites of top two or three competitors closest to us to determine if it is the right time for our pricing to be increased. This is not done as an assigned office task, rather it is done by only a couple of us and then presented to the owners as, "Hey look what I found online".

AI: That's a really insightful workflow. It sounds like AI serves as your initial filter and research assistant, but then you take a very hands-on approach for the final evaluation and decision-making. 

When you present these findings to the owners as "Hey look what I found online," how do you handle explaining that AI was part of your research process? Do you mention it, or does it matter to them how you gathered the information?

User: It isn't mentioned and they don't ask. They have multiple enterprises so as long as we keep everything running smoothly, and they can mainly be hands off, they just say thanks for the information and either implement an idea from it, or nothing comes of it. It is a family company so sometimes change comes slowly.

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - you're essentially using AI as a behind-the-scenes tool to help you be more effective, but it's not something that needs to be formally acknowledged or discussed. 

You mentioned earlier that you don't use AI for "general duties" - I'm curious about that distinction. What makes competitor research and client verification different from your day-to-day tasks? What keeps you from using AI for those other duties?

User: Many of the duties revolve around a specific customized computer program, customer interaction, outdoor duties and driving from site to site.

AI: That makes complete sense - those are very hands-on, location-specific tasks that require your physical presence and human judgment.

I'm curious about the customer interaction piece. Even though you handle those interactions yourself, have you ever considered or experimented with using AI to help prepare for customer conversations, or to follow up on them in some way?

User: Customer interactions in our industry are very in the moment. Decisions are generally made within minutes by customers as to whether what we offer will work for them or not; providing we have availability for their specific needs. Decisions don't take weeks or months with multiple follow ups like it would in say home sales. We do not do follow ups after a customer visit unless they want to be put on a waiting list when we cannot immediately fulfill their needs, or they decide after viewing or confirming pricing that it will not work for them.

AI: That's a really clear picture - you're operating in a fast-paced, immediate decision environment where customers need answers right then and there. 

Given that quick turnaround nature of your business, when you do use AI for that competitor and client research, how far in advance are you typically doing that work? Is it something you're constantly monitoring, or more of a periodic check-in when you have time?

User: I wouldn't say it is just when-we-have-time or constant. It might be couple of times a month if things in the industry are changing rapidly, less if things are relatively flat.

AI: That rhythm makes sense - staying responsive to industry changes without it becoming overwhelming. 

When you do that research a couple times a month, is it usually something you initiate on your own when you notice changes happening, or does it come up more in response to specific situations - like losing a customer to a competitor or hearing about new pricing in the market?

User: It is self initiated as general monitoring. News of new pricing by a competitor would more likely be confirmed by researching their website or doing a "shopping" call to them.

AI: So you're taking a proactive monitoring approach with AI, then switching to more direct methods when you need to verify specific competitor moves. That's a really strategic use.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI for this research. Are there certain parts of that competitive analysis process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those parts different for you?

User: I prefer hands on research of  a specific competitor website as follow up to confirm what AI has supplied, and to look for any additional details it may have considered not important.

AI: That follow-up verification step sounds important to you. Can you share a time when doing that hands-on website research revealed something significant that the AI had missed or downplayed? What was that situation like?

User: Even though billing prices may appear the same at first glance that is not always the case, it can be in the fine details. For instance. a monthly fee is not the same as a four week fee and many customers overlook the fact they will be making an extra payment every year on the four week plan.

AI: That's a perfect example of why your hands-on verification matters - those subtle billing structure differences could significantly impact your competitive positioning, but they're exactly the kind of nuanced detail that might get glossed over in an AI summary.

When you discover insights like that four-week versus monthly billing distinction, how does that change how you approach your own pricing or customer conversations? Do you find yourself actively using those details as selling points?

User: When customers call doing price comparisons we make sure to tell them to ask anywhere they call what the billing cycle is - four week or monthly.

AI: That's smart - you're essentially educating customers to make better comparisons, which probably builds trust while highlighting your transparency.

I'm curious about the emotional side of using AI in your work. Can you share a time when using AI for research made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There are times it takes multiple turns and rewording before you finally get to where it understands what is being asked.

AI: Tell me more about those frustrating moments. When you're having to rephrase and take multiple turns, what's usually causing that disconnect? Is it the AI not understanding your industry terminology, or something else about how you're trying to communicate what you need?

User: I'm not sure where the disconnect is. I don't know if it is the terminology or phrasing used that isn't getting the point across.

AI: That uncertainty about where the breakdown is happening sounds frustrating - you're putting in effort but not sure exactly how to fix it when things aren't clicking.

When you do finally break through and get the AI to understand what you're looking for, is there usually an "aha" moment where you figure out what language or approach worked? Or does it still feel somewhat mysterious when it finally works?

User: Still a mystery.

AI: That unpredictability must make it harder to feel confident about using AI as a tool. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll mostly stick with the current approach of using it for that competitive research?

User: I do not see it evolving with the company I am currently with.

AI: That makes sense given what you've described about the nature of your work and company culture.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that might give us insight into how people are actually using these tools in real workplace situations?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences with me today. I really appreciated your insights about how AI fits into your competitive research workflow - particularly that practical example about the monthly versus four-week billing cycles and how you use those discoveries to help customers make better comparisons.

Your perspective on using AI as a behind-the-scenes research tool, while keeping the hands-on verification and customer interaction pieces firmly in your own hands, gives us valuable insight into how people are thoughtfully integrating these technologies into their work.

Thanks again for your time and for being so open about your experiences. This has been really helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
