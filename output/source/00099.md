Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds good. Let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So being a team leader at a primary school I have found AI to be a useful for a wide range of things.

1. Ai is incredibly helpful for writing end of semester reports for children. Myself and several colleagues have put in generic ideas about the maths and literacy attainments for children and AI models have provided coherent and relevant comments for us to send home to parents. By giving some parameters it become quicker and easier to finish reporting. And when you have 30 children to write about, this is incredibly time saving.
2. I have used ai extensively to help generate curriculum documents such as lesson and unit plans, scope and sequence documents and individual worksheets. The time saved by using the models has made a big difference.
3. Writing applications for higher honours, such as school leader positions, is tricky and I have used AI to develop a statement of claims that I have written and make sure it is linked to a job description. I've also been able to improve my language In the written pieces by using AI.
4. I can use it to make sure my emails are professional for parents if needed.
5. I have created 1 page work plans with images.

AI: That's really comprehensive - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated across different aspects of your role. I'm particularly struck by how you mentioned using it for student reports with 30 children to write about.

Tell me more about that process with the semester reports. How do you actually work with the AI when you're creating those comments for parents?

User: So what we would do is put in the parameters required such as needs to be no more than 200 words.  I would then add in 2 of the curriculum achievement standards the child had achieved and an idea of the next step and something they could practice at home
I would probably add it needs to be parent friendly and targeted at the correct age group for example year 5. I'd then get the ai to generate this piece of writing for me and make any changes required. I think what usually takes anywhere from 10 to 20 hours could be dropped to 4 or 5 with this.

AI: That's a significant time reduction - from 20 hours down to 4 or 5. When you say you make changes to what the AI generates, what kinds of adjustments do you typically find yourself making? Are there certain aspects the AI handles well versus areas where you need to step in with your own expertise?

User: I think AI is very good at leadership language and is slowly developing its more empathetic and soft language. So when I want something more creative and supportive of the students and nice it is good but still needs more. Whereas the factual element, using curriculum points, is easier for it to write to.
I'll usually male minor changes to sentence structure or length as the models can often be quite verbose as well.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction between the factual curriculum elements versus the more empathetic, supportive language. It sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where AI excels and where your human touch is still essential.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: At the end of the day teaching is a human endeavour and the personable element needs to be done by a human. So a lot of the relational work and creative parts I prefer to do myself, such as crafting really detailed lessons. What I would use ai for these days is things like vocabulary generation, structured lesson plans that I would fill in. I find ai often churns out same same stuff so for me it's definitely more about being given more diverse ideas I may not have thought about and less about how it should be delivered and big thinking questions and ideas.

AI:

User: Hello?

AI: Sorry about that - I'm here! 

That's a really insightful way to think about it - using AI for the foundational structure and idea generation, but keeping the creative delivery and big thinking questions for yourself. It sounds like you see AI as expanding your toolkit of possibilities rather than replacing your professional judgment.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I have been teaching for over 10 years so generally I would have a big idea of the lessons I would want for example teaching fractions with addition and subtraction using like and unlike denominators. What I would then ask for is how to use more vocabulary and steps to give the information to the students.

Another recent example was asking about vocabulary and reading lessons for the novel storm boy. I wanted children to really understand character development so  asked for words and activities that would build into that using the book. So probably more collaborative as I would take an idea then build on it and use it for different books and ideas and concepts.

AI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense - you're bringing your 10+ years of teaching experience to frame the big picture, then using AI to help flesh out the details and expand your options.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been much discussion about it at your school?

User: AI is becoming a large part of the teacher toolkit due to its ability to take time consuming thought processes and break them down into simple ideas.
Most teachers are beginning to come on boars due to work load pressures and finding different ways to enhance their knowledge of topics before teaching them.

AI: It sounds like workload pressures are really driving adoption among your colleagues. That makes sense given the time savings you described earlier.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think when I was recently completing an application for a deputy principal position.

I had written my application and asked ai to check it against the job description. The majority of my ideas fit into the description so I was really happy that my writing appeared to fit the needs of the school. I think my frustration came later as I began making changes, such as talk about me more as a leader, when I couldn't get the AI to do some of the metrics related to length and the language then I got lost with about 4 or 5 different iterations and struggled to find the bestcopy.

AI: That's really relatable - starting with that satisfaction of having your ideas validated against the job description, then getting into that frustrating cycle of iterations where you lose track of which version is actually the best one.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As I said earlier I don't truly believe AI can take over teaching as there is far too much human interaction and relationship requirement for people to learn effectively.

I can see it's use as a tool in helping with planning and the administrative side of teaching that is a hassle but it can't truly ever take over.
I need to keep my skills with it to keep up with the younger generation who use it as a standard part of their work.

AI: That perspective about teaching being fundamentally human-centered makes a lot of sense. And keeping up with the younger generation who see it as standard - that's an interesting point about staying relevant.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will be a matter of experimenting with different programs and thoughts. I'd love to do more with images links to stories such as nook covers and artistic pieces. Also using it to help flesh out students ideas. Potentially teaching students to use it like when Scratch coding first came out and it became a big part of what we taught. A lot of supporting others while learning and experimenting and trying to keep ahead of the curb.

AI: That vision of potentially teaching students to use AI - like when Scratch coding was first introduced - is a really fascinating parallel. It sounds like you see yourself potentially becoming a guide for others in this space.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a collaborative tool that expands your toolkit rather than replacing your professional judgment as an educator.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think it's a great resource but my worry is it will cause teaching to merely be about content delivery and we will take the humanity, artistry and creativity out of teaching. We already have a generation of ipad kids and do we really want that to be our future of learning? I'm not keen to see a Wall-E-esque future of learning for our children.

AI: That's a really powerful closing thought - the concern about preserving the humanity, artistry, and creativity in teaching. The Wall-E reference really captures that worry about what we might lose if we lean too heavily on technology in education.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI as a helpful tool while maintaining the fundamentally human aspects of teaching will be incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've reflected on both the benefits and the risks as you navigate this evolving landscape in education.

User: Thanks Claude. You're a good bot

AI: Thank you! I really enjoyed our conversation and learning about your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into teaching. Your perspective on maintaining that human element while leveraging technology as a tool was genuinely insightful.

Take care, and best of luck with that deputy principal application!
