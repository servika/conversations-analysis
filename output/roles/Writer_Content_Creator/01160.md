Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's go

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a TV writer. Most recently (the past 3 years) that has been in development. I pitch an idea for an original TV series to buyers, then they pay me to develop and write the pilot episode. The hope is that it would continue to be developed into a produced pilot and then a series, but I have not made it that far yet with my original projects.

AI: That's fascinating - the development process sounds both exciting and challenging. So you're creating these original series concepts from scratch and then crafting that crucial first episode.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI for research both at the brainstorming stage and then in a more granular way when I need specifics for a scene

AI: Tell me more about that research process. What kinds of things are you researching, and how does using AI for that feel different from other research methods you might have used before?

User: Other research methods involved mostly web searches, but occasionally I would read books on a subject. Previous pitch I sold was about quantum computing, and I didn't use AI at all in my research. I watched a lot of educational videos on YouTube, read articles I searched for on the internet, and read a novel where quantum computing was an element of the storytelling for context. On my current project, using AI, my research time is cut down significantly. It's a legal drama and I don't have any formal legal training, so I use to ask how certain legal processes work -- the name of motions, or order of events in a lawsuit. I will run hypotheticals by it to if my imagined scenario has any way of working in reality or if there are any real world examples to back it up.

AI: That's really interesting how dramatically it's changed your research efficiency. When you're running these legal hypotheticals by AI or asking about processes, how do you handle the question of accuracy? Do you find yourself double-checking the information, or has your trust in it evolved over time?

User: Especially with legal things, I feel I have to check much more frequently. I'm sure you've heard about actual lawyers who use AI to draft briefs and it's full of made up caselaw. I've caught many hallucinations in my research (not just legal, but it seems to be more common in that area for some reason). When I've settled on something through my AI research, I will do traditional research of Googling or reaching out to an expert like a friend who's a lawyer to double check things. I wouldn't want to waste that friend's time checking dozens of ideas when I haven't settled on the one that's going to end up in the script yet.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI to narrow down the field before bringing in human expertise. You mentioned catching hallucinations fairly regularly. When that happens, how does it affect your workflow in the moment? Do you find yourself adjusting how you interact with the AI, or does it just become part of the process you expect?

User: It's very annoying. I hate the anthropomorphizing of technology. If it makes it easier to use/interact with (like using natural language instead of code) that's great. But I don't need an AI to apologize to me when I catch it making stuff up. I need it to do better. When I catch a hallucination and tell the model something like "I just looked that up and it's wrong," the response is often something like "Oh my gosh! You're so right, and I apologize for my mistake..." And so then I wonder, if all it took was me saying it was wrong (with no cited source) for it to reverse, then why doesn't the model just ask itself if it's wrong before giving ANY answer, and check itself? Or even worse, it makes me wonder if the reversal/apology is wrong (maybe the original thing was ultimately true and my fact-checking was the part that was wrong), and the model's just trying to make me want to keep using it. The way it handles mistakes and the certainty with which it presents information is very disconcerting.

AI: That uncertainty you're describing sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to build a solid foundation for your creative work. It sounds like the AI's conversational style actually undermines your confidence in the information rather than helping.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that whole experience feel for you as a writer?

User: I'm also writing a feature screenplay on the side -- it's an action/adventure in the vein of the Mission Impossible franchise. I came up with a really clever idea for a setpiece -- a heist in a world-famous location -- but then suddenly worried if I was ripping off a scene from an already existing Mission Impossible movie, so I asked an AI model if Mission Impossible ever had any sequences set in that location, and it said it did and mentioned the exact movie, described the characters in the scene, and how it played into the plot. Now, I've seen all the movies, but it's possible I'd forgotten this... so I asked at what minute-mark the scene took place, the AI told me, then I watched the movie at that point and the scene the AI described didn't exist. In my own subsequent research, I read the script and the scene did not exist there either. At no point in any Mission Impossible movie was there a scene set at this location, nor was the location even mentioned in passing. So that was an example of AI being incredibly unhelpful in my research.

AI: Wow, that's such a perfect example of how the hallucination problem can actually create more work instead of saving time. You ended up having to do the research you were trying to avoid anyway, plus deal with the false alarm.

When you're working with AI on your current legal drama project, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions when you're using it for research and brainstorming?

User: I never ask AI for dramatic or character input. I deliberately keep a boundary there for a few reasons: 1) That's the fun part for me -- it's why I'm a writer. Why would I outsource that? 2) I do not trust that AI wouldn't just pitch me something that exactly exists in a TV show, film, or book, and I just haven't seen before but someone who reads my script might identify. 3) Using AI for art is garbage. It's a highly advanced plagiarizer that is creating for an audience that has feelings, not from feelings itself. It could be good, it could even be enough one day, but I don't want to consume my art from something that can't feel so I certainly wouldn't use something that can't feel for the creative part of my art.

AI: That's a really clear delineation you've drawn - using AI as a research tool but keeping the creative heart of the work entirely in your own hands. It sounds like you see a fundamental difference between information gathering and the actual creative expression.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI for that research side of things?

User: What do you mean?

AI: I'm curious about the broader impact on how you work. For instance, has the speed of research changed how you approach developing ideas? Or has having this research tool affected the kinds of projects you're willing to take on, or how you structure your time during development?

User: With AI, I feel more confident writing about specific areas of expertise that I have no training or expertise myself. It's a backstop that I can use to test ideas and see if they're remotely feasible without having to commit a ton of time and energy into learning the subject ahead of time. Once I've settled into a world or idea for the show, that's when I do the deeper research, but AI helps me rule out concepts or subjects that just won't work much faster.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it's like having a quick feasibility filter before you invest deeply in an idea. You mentioned earlier some concerns about accuracy and hallucinations. Beyond those technical issues, what other concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: As I mentioned before, I am concerned that AI will replace human artists. It's already good enough to replace voice actors pretty much. I do think a human still gives a better performance than an AI voice, but the AI voice is still convincing (most people wouldn't know it's not human), it's just not as inspired. I'm worried the capitalist profit machine will create such an abundance of this inferior AI voice work that people get so used to it, they forget that they ever cared about the other. Their standards fall and AI becomes the norm not because it's better, but because it's cheaper and "good enough." I feel that could happen with creative writing as well. We're all frogs in a boiling pot and careers will have been ended and industries folded before we realize it's too late to bring them back. AI should be used to make life easier -- it should do the jobs people don't want to do. I don't want or need AI to write a poem or make a movie or create a painting -- there is more human art and human artists in the world than I possibly have time to experience in my life, so I'll spend my time enjoying those things before I seek out an AI's work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the broader implications beyond just your own workflow. The "good enough" versus inspired distinction you're making seems crucial.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll maintain those same boundaries you've set, or do you imagine your approach might shift?

User: Even before AI, cheap, garbage content has been eating away at the legacy entertainment business. TikTok and Instagram videos that people mindlessly watch for hours are pulling eyeballs from expensive, well produced film and TV projects. AI is already being used to create those types of social media video posts that just scroll endlessly with some ostensibly interesting piece of information or joke or observation. Right now vertical videos are the new gold rush -- those are still human created, but the content is such garbage, I fear it's creating a class of consumer with low enough standards that if the whole thing got replaced by AI, they wouldn't really notice or care. I don't think legacy media is going to transition fully to AI, but I do think it will be cannibalized by it.

AI: Those are all really insightful observations you've shared about your experiences with AI in your creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on drawing clear boundaries between research assistance and creative expression, and your thoughts on how "good enough" content might gradually shift industry standards.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative boundaries while leveraging AI as a research tool, and your concerns about the broader impact on industry standards, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated how thoughtfully you've navigated using AI where it serves you while protecting what you see as the essential human elements of your craft. Thanks again for participating!
