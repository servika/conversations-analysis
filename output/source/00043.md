Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's do it!

AI: Great! I'm excited to hear about your work.

Let's start at the beginning - could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? What did that process look like from your initial idea all the way to the final output?

User: hmmm, a project that I recently worked on would be with a Hospital Wing in Edmonton, a new surgical unit being designed as an extension of the Hospital and they need to have medical oxygen flowing to a large number of instruments to feed the patients, it will be a 24/7 facility, so looking at the best way to supply, how to best design the oxygen tanks, piping, to make sure we also minimize costs where we can for the end users, my initial idea was to have a large bulk tank, and design the piping into the building using vacuum insulated pipe, and depending on the delivery output required, add safety relief valves along the way, study the impurities that might arise and handle ( mainly moisture ), for all the construction parts I just sourced that from a local third party contractor and supplied them with the engineering drawings and got a quote from them, then worked on the internal design, studying peak hours demand, fluctuating pressure drops along the line, to find what the best material is, type of material to use, etc...then prepare that proposal to the client and present what I think would be best for them

AI: That sounds like a complex project with a lot of moving parts - from the bulk storage system all the way through to understanding usage patterns and pressure dynamics.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I use AI for quick conversions of course, researching material products, keeping up to date with new advances that the industry is working on to stay up to date, a lot more with the proposal section, rewording or rephrasing my thoughts..

AI: Tell me more about using AI for researching material products and staying up to date with industry advances. What does that process look like for you?

User: It typically involves me asking AI to search for what people are doing for specific gases, and what material they are working on, any new research that can lead to industry savings, to search for new materials being tested at university in particular fields, any new patents that are related to my field of work

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a research scout to keep tabs on emerging developments. 

When you're doing this kind of research with AI versus how you might have done it before, how do you decide whether to rely on AI or go with your more traditional research methods?

User: with AI, i focus more on the links and then use AI to get me the sources more than anything I guess, traditionally it would be mainly google, which I still use as well, AI in support, but if there are things along the way that I am reading that I need some clarification on, then I will ask AI

AI: So AI is acting more like a research assistant - helping you find sources and clarify things as you go, rather than replacing your traditional methods entirely.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the pressure drop calculations, the peak demand analysis, or the technical design work - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: simply because I do not think AI is familiar with how that process works, and it would end up wasting my time, it is not familiar with the steps, maybe if I have some time in the future, I can come up with something that I can upload like a step by step instructions/formulas to use, but I find it a task I can excel more at the moment with excel, power BI, matlab

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you know those technical processes inside and out, and you've got proven tools that work reliably for those calculations.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask about the areas where you have been using AI - like for researching materials or clarifying concepts you're reading about. When AI gives you information or explanations, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I typically trust AI with the researching aspect and providing data from the net, verifying that by simply checking the source it is pulling the information from, reputable sources only, when it comes to validations, over 10 years experience allows me to be able to tell if the model is far off reality..

AI: That experience filter sounds invaluable - being able to spot when something doesn't align with what you know from a decade in the field.

Here's my final question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't help with, what would that be and why?

User: hmmm I would like for it to handle my basic admin stuff, scan my email during a specific date and provide a summary of what needs to get done... uploading my excel and data and customizing it in a way that I can trust

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a research scout while relying on your technical expertise for the complex engineering calculations were particularly insightful. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI enhances your research capabilities without overstepping into areas where your domain knowledge and proven tools are more reliable.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how experience acts as a filter for validating AI outputs really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific and engineering work. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing such thoughtful insights about your work. Have a great day!
