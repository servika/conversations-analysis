Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: typically I use AI mostly for debugging code. it has essentially replaced the process I would previously follow where, when presented with an issue requiring further information, I would google or search Stack Overflow for the problem, and then try to implement listed solutions. I also use it for researching tools to use for particular tasks

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become your go-to resource for technical problem-solving. 

When you say you use it for researching tools, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically approach AI when you need to find the right tool for a task?

User: well I state the task I need completing, giving as much detail as I feel is necessary, I then list what I don't want, e.g. particular tools I've previously tried and don't like, or general mistakes that the AI may make in its decision-making, then I get the AI to list some tools and details about those tools. if the tools listed seem to fit what I was looking for, I will then do my own research on them, from the tool's website and on forums where people talk about their experiences with the tools

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a starting point but then doing your own verification. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: yes there are. although I will sometimes use AI to write boilerplate code--e.g. python datetime format wrangling--when writing something long-ish and complex--take for example asset trading algorithms--you absolutely can write out a strategy and then get an LLM to simply code it for you, but I do not like to do this, as it is much harder for me to debug and improve upon code that I haven't written myself, and the second I need to do either thing, I would end up spending almost as much time trying to grok the code as I would have done simply writing it myself

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the ownership and understanding piece seems really important to you. It sounds like there's a threshold where the complexity of debugging unfamiliar code outweighs the time saved by having AI write it initially.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm much more likely to collaborate throughout a task, taking an iterative approach, guiding the AI to the correct solutions

AI: That collaborative, iterative approach sounds like it gives you a lot of control over the process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: probably the primary thing they've suggested is different LLMs to use, particularly pointing out the relative cost value of using the Deepseek API over the OpenAI API

AI: Interesting - so it sounds like your colleagues are pretty open about AI usage and focused on practical considerations like cost-effectiveness.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I honestly don't really assign much emotion to the outputs of AI. if it works it works, if it doesn't, either I have to fix it with better prompting or it's beyond the scope of the LLM

AI: That's a really pragmatic perspective - treating it as just another tool in your toolkit. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel that's it's just best to get ahead of the curve on the use of AI tools, including Cursor LangChain, to make it an advantage rather than a disadvantage

AI: So you're taking more of a "if you can't beat them, join them" approach - using AI tools to enhance your capabilities rather than worrying about replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I suspect that right now AI is a little bit of a growing bubble. everyone is desperate to implement it, and there will be more and more uptake of it, until it gets to a point where companies realise that it isn't quite as powerful a tool as they think, and that they've lost a bit of control over the nitty gritty of their products. I would liken this to how I originally would have been likely to have implemented a hypothetical asset trading algorithm using an AI. I then would have tried to use it, realised I didn't actually understand what was going on, and then had to reassess my approach. however you can only get to the point where you reassess once you've tried it. essentially I think that my specific relationship with AI will not change hugely, as I've been using it for a long time now with little change. however I think my employer's attitude to it may start to change sooner or later

AI: That's a fascinating perspective on the broader AI adoption cycle - the idea that we might see a correction when organizations realize they've lost touch with the fundamentals of their work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the potential bubble effect and how understanding your own code remains crucial for complex tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: not really

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach, the importance of maintaining code ownership for complex tasks, and your perspective on the AI adoption cycle will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
