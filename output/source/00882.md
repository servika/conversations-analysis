Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for idea generation mainly. Sometimes I have a starting idea,  but not sure where to go next, so use it for this. I will ask it to break down tasks, so that I can follow lists and do things systematically. I will also ask AI to rewrite things for me sometimes, and to check for any errors.

AI: That's helpful - it sounds like you're using AI across several different stages of your work process. 

When you mention using it for idea generation, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? What's happening when you find yourself turning to AI because you're not sure where to go next?

User: I will feel a bit stuck, and have a broad idea of what I want to do. For example, one of my jobs involves making digital products. I may have an idea of what I want to create, but not sure which product I should start with or what would be the logical next step afterwards. I will ask it to suggest ideas for bundles of products, then break the tasks down. Or I might give it a brief for example "pastel stationary collection" and ask it to give me some ideas what can fit in here.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using it when you hit that moment of knowing your destination but needing help mapping the route.

Tell me more about that feeling of being "stuck" that you mentioned. What does that experience look like for you before you decide to bring AI into the process?

User: I have usually looked at different websites, but either see conflicted, or convoluted answers. If I don't solve it, I get frustrated, and will end up leaving the task until later. So I will lean on AI to help break this down

AI: So AI becomes a way to push through that frustration and avoid putting tasks on the back burner. That makes sense.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Sometimes there are things that I want to use my own personal experience with. This would be the case in my academic job. I am also very aware that academia is strict on AI use, so I am careful to follow rules as to when I can and can't use it. I also try and make myself handle certain tasks as I get worried that I will become reliant on AI and not be able to use my own thinking

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - balancing the benefits with maintaining your own capabilities. 

When you say you get worried about becoming reliant on AI and not being able to use your own thinking, can you tell me more about what that concern looks like for you? What specific situations make you think "I need to handle this myself"?

User: Say if I am going to write a letter, or a description of a product. I know I can do that myself, but I am asking AI to do it. Sometimes I will make myself do it because I can. I am worried if I don't, I will get less capable. For example, if you stopped doing any maths at all - you would forget or lose the ability. I feel it is important to keep using the brain as a muscle. It is also good to keep using your brain for problem solving to ward off things such as dementia

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on maintaining cognitive fitness. The comparison to math skills is particularly vivid.

When you do decide to tackle something like writing a letter or product description yourself instead of using AI, how does that experience feel compared to when you do use AI for similar tasks?

User: It is harder, because I have to sit and write it all out myself, plan it, make sure I am using a good standard of grammar. It is also in some respects more rewarding and I feel like I am more deeply connected with the content, and have it committed to memory

AI: That connection you describe - feeling more deeply connected to the content and having it committed to memory - that's really insightful.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate, and generate ideas then go and do the tasks it suggests myself.

AI: So you're taking more of a collaborative approach where you're generating the roadmap together but doing the actual work yourself.

Can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? How do you go back and forth with AI during that process?

User: I will say something like "I am thinking of designing a new product, but I don't know whether to niche it by design, or by function. What do you suggest?". Then when it gives me the answer I will follow up with "okay, so out of this, for speed and ease, which should I start with?". Then I go and do the product creation.

AI: That's a clear example of how you're using AI as a strategic thinking partner to help you make decisions, then taking action on your own.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: in academia, yes, because it is frowned upon, so I do not use it. In my other role, I use it freely as do many others

AI: That's an interesting contrast between the two work environments you navigate.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would be satisfied when I am given a workaround that saves me hours. For example, creating something on Notion. It will give me step by step formulas etc which I would not have been able to do. I get frustrated when I ask it to NOT do something, but it does it anyway

AI: That satisfaction from getting those step-by-step formulas that save you hours really makes sense - especially for technical tasks like Notion setups.

Tell me more about those frustrating moments when you ask it NOT to do something but it does it anyway. What kinds of things are you typically trying to get it to avoid?

User: I will say "please do not use a double hyphen, as it is a giveaway that I am using AI" and it uses it. Or other small things that it can't seem to get, then I get frustrated

AI: Ah, so it's those moments when AI doesn't follow specific instructions that would help you maintain the natural flow of your work - and it sounds like that's particularly important when you're trying to blend AI assistance seamlessly into your process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I try to make sure I do things myself so that I don't forget the skills

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I feel I will be able to delegate more tasks, and ask it to do more. For example right now if it says "would you like me to create a canvas mockup?" and I say "yes" - it cannot do that. So I imagine in the future I will be able to do more

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a thinking partner while being mindful about maintaining your own cognitive skills - that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving your own abilities really came through clearly.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the balance between collaboration and maintaining your own skills, especially across different workplace cultures, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
