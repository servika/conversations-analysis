Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, fire away with your questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI fits in mainly across two ways. Embedded AI into software, and the use of AI such as ChatGPT to assist with tasks.

AI: That's an interesting distinction you've made between embedded AI and tools like ChatGPT. Tell me more about how you use each of these in practice - what specific tasks do you turn to them for?

User: With embedded AI, the usage moves between quiote a lot and very minimal. With accoutning software, AI is very useful for automating routine and repeat tasks. I find this an excellent use of AI - the software makes recommendations when repeat items are categorized and asks if I would like to set up a rule. I often do this and it has greatly reeduced the time spent in undertaking accounting and bookkeeping functions. In software such as Word (usign copilot) the recommendations are asinine and not helpful, in fact they make using the software more laborious rather than less, and as such I have turned it off. When I need assistance, say for drafting an email, I will enter relevant details into say ChatGPT and ask for a draft before editing it.

AI: That's a really revealing contrast - the accounting software sounds like it's genuinely streamlining your work, while Word's Copilot is actually getting in your way. 

When you use ChatGPT for something like drafting an email, what does that editing process look like for you? How much of the AI's draft do you typically keep versus rewrite?

User: This is dependent on the type of email. I often just want a basic draft so as to move away from a blank page and to get a sensible structure - this helps me think (without really thinking or expending time) and allows a greater focus to the relevant details that will need editing. Generally the editing is quite heavy in this scenario, but partially because I have given very limited information to the model in order to speed up the process. Occassionally I will enter more detail and this often happens in areas where I am less experienced (such as HR) as it helps shape my language more, rather than being part of a thought process. As such, I would say it moves between about 90% re-written, and more like 50%. Typically the copy is of fairly low quality compared to my own standards so I do edit a lot - however, when I draft an email and come back and edit my own work, it will usually involve re-writing 30% or so.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using it in two quite different ways depending on the situation. It sounds like sometimes it's more of a thinking tool to get you started, and other times it's helping you navigate unfamiliar territory like HR communications.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The tasks I do not use AI for are generally for tasks I am so familiar with it just isnt necessary, or w3hedre they are very detail orientated. With high levels of detail, it takes so long to instruct an AI agent in order to produce anythign relevant that the time is poorly spent (I could usually write the email faster than I could instruct the AI). AI models are still only so useful - in honesty the quality is not high enough (or the level of internal knowledge too low) for it to be worthwhile to use.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's a threshold where the instruction time outweighs the benefit, especially for detailed work you already know well.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I never delegate  a task entirely - the AI isnt capable enough for this, nor is it accurate enough. I look at AI models as a tool to augment work rather than to be used heavily. I could easily see for people with lower ability that the AI may well have surpassed their own writing skills and would be more useful.

AI: That's a clear perspective on AI as an augmentation tool rather than a replacement. You mentioned that people with different skill levels might have different experiences with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work in construction and the reality is that some of the workers use AI much more heavily. This transpires for various reasons but one of the main reasons is that English is not their first language and it is much easier for them, and honestly the models are superior in quality to their own writing skill. Many of them are also not very able in terms of writing anyway, so the models produce results that are better than they can create themselves. This has not impacted my own use, but it has highlighted to me why you need to be caerful, since AI emails sent are often incorrect from a factual point of view (though I cant see what was entered so this may be down to user error as well).

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how language barriers and different skill levels create very different AI experiences within the same workplace. The factual accuracy issue you've noticed in emails from colleagues is particularly interesting.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have tried in vain to try and make AI models produce very good search results in specific procurement scenarios. The reality is that they simply search on Google and lack the sort of insight that would lead to superior results. All the models currently used exhibit very poor judgement and it is frustrating that the models cannot be made to look more deeply into various searches and results - I feel this should be easy to acheive, yet somehow the results are always of very low quality. I find this frustrating because I can see how it could be improved but the models just dont want to play ball.

AI: That frustration really comes through - you can envision how the search and procurement assistance could work better, but the models seem to fall short of that potential. It sounds like they're being too surface-level when you need deeper, more nuanced judgment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Absolutely. From what I have seen, AI is very good at very narrow tasks but struggles with the overall picture and there seems to be a disconnect between finding overarching goals and the grannulated steps one needs to execute to get there. If you did not know these skills where AI looks certain to take over, it would make using AI and instructing AI much more difficult since one wouldnt know the difference between somethign that is being performed correctly or not.

AI: That's a really thoughtful point about needing to understand the fundamentals to effectively evaluate and direct AI's work. The disconnect you've identified between high-level goals and granular execution steps is particularly interesting.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think there is a big opportunity to make AI work in your favour very well, but it almost needs a training module so that individual's can consistently instruct AI using a similar set of instructions that can be edited and refined over time to enhance the end product. Since these would almost always be individual to different work streams, set-ups, tasks and industries, I cant see it being useful to try and force this into a singluar model - I think it needs to be an organic learning curve from individuals that can be retained and learnt from.

AI: That's a compelling vision - essentially developing personalized AI instruction frameworks that improve over time through your own refinement process. It sounds like you're thinking about creating your own "training protocols" that would be specific to your work context and could evolve as you learn what works.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how different skill levels and language backgrounds create very different AI experiences within the same workplace, and your vision for developing personalized instruction frameworks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I would really like it to be more advanced and in the workplace already!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the gap between AI's current capabilities and its potential, especially around search and procurement tasks, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's clear you have a nuanced understanding of both AI's current limitations and its future possibilities. Your thoughts on developing personalized instruction frameworks and the importance of maintaining foundational skills really stood out as valuable perspectives we'll be considering in our work.

I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
