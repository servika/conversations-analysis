Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I currently work many different freelance jobs instead of working a normal job. With that being said, for freelance activities I usually do things like creative writing and designing. I use AI regularly to help me with brainstorming different ideas and even rewriting some sentences when I feel like they don't sound right. Recently, I have taken on a new job adventure and I am hoping to open a small business that sells various customized items and has a bold and eye-catching brand name. I used AI a lot when coming up with the ideas for this and I have implemented it in the design process as well as marketing and logo making - I usually collect a lot of different ideas and then edit them into one to kind of make it my own and make it look the best that I think it can.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of creative work, from writing to your new business venture.

When you mention collecting different AI-generated ideas and then editing them into one to make it your own, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like? How do you decide which elements to keep or change?

User: Recently, I decided to play around with a few different graphic design AI programs. I basically explained what I wanted my final logo/product to look like and collected about 10 different ideas that the AI provided. Following this, I sorted through and kept only the ones that had elements that I really liked, for example a specific object, border, or font. After collecting these, I proceeded to edit them to my liking. I took all the various elements that had been selected and made a design that was close to what I had been picturing. Following this, sometimes, I will use it to brainstorm and develop ideas that may be helpful to something I am working on. Usually, a creative story and from there I will read through and kind of compare the suggestions to what I have and then settle somewhere in the middle to make the final work genuine.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - you're essentially using AI as a source of raw material that you then curate and synthesize. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I definitely prefer coming up with the smaller details myself when I am writing because those feel like they should ultimately be decided by the writer not the AI; in my opinion, it is important to show my own personal creativity rather than relying on the AI completely. For design elements, I know that I could have AI combine all the elements that I like and come up with a final product. However, I like having the freedom to comb through any small details and make customizations as I see fit.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making about maintaining your personal creativity and having that freedom to control the details.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I definitely prefer to collaborate throughout whatever I am working on!

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration - what does that back-and-forth process look like for you in practice?

User: I basically ask for a general idea, guidance, or advice based on what I am working on. I then collaborate until I land on some ideas that I like or find have elements that I had been thinking of. After this, I collect the parts that I like and customize it into what I want it to be.

AI: That iterative approach makes a lot of sense. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned working freelance jobs, I'm curious about whether other freelancers you know or your clients have shaped how you think about using these tools.

User: Most of my clients love AI and are absolutely fascinated by it! It has never been seen as something bad, per say, in the work that I do and it's actually been very helpful when I can show the client many different things and then decide what pieces I should build upon. Along with that, AI has been great to just start the process when the overall idea is very vague and I may not have much to go off of - it is nice to have AI generate some rough ideas and then go from there.

AI: That's great to hear that your clients are so receptive to it and even see the value in the process you're using.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Working on some logos last week, AI made me super satisfied with what it provided! I ended up getting some really great ideas that I further edited and made into what I was thinking of. The reason it made me happy was because I really only had a vague idea of what I wanted and AI definitely sparked my creativity by showing me multiple ideas.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI helping you break through that initial creative block when you only had that vague starting point.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would prefer to only use AI to collaborate - I feel that people are a bit dramatic with AI taking over. I mean, at this point, I regularly see typos and other errors that I have to fix but it's nice to collaborate with when doing a solo project. I think that many companies and individuals would prefer that an actual human is doing the final edits and product rather than solely relying on AI. Therefore, I don't think I give the concept of AI taking over much thought.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing it as a collaboration tool rather than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that, in the future, my relationship with AI will go far. I'm excited to see it improve and I think that there is a lot of work that can be completed better by using it in collaboration.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner rather than worrying about it taking over, and how you've developed this iterative process of gathering ideas and then making them your own.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think that was it. I am eager to see AI's continued growth!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative collaborator - especially how you collect different elements and synthesize them into something uniquely yours - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating these tools into your freelance work while maintaining your own creative voice. Thanks again, and best of luck with your new business venture!
