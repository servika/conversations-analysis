Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I do not.

AI: Great, let's get started then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: The main task I use AI for in work is using Generative Fill from the Adobe Suite to edit photographs. Photographs form part of my work but are not the main thing I do (I am a videographer).

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI as part of your photography workflow within your broader videography work. 

Tell me more about how you use Generative Fill specifically. What kinds of edits are you typically making to these photographs?

User: I wouldn't generally use Generative Fill to create things that aren't there in pictures per se, but say for example there's a street sign visible in a photo and I would rather it wasn't, I will use the Fill tool to remove the sign and assume the background.

AI: I see - so you're using it more for removal and cleanup rather than creating new content. That sounds like a pretty specific way of working with the tool.

When you're doing this kind of photo editing work, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI - like trying different approaches or refining the results - or do you typically get what you need in one go?

User: Sometimes I feel the AI knows exactly what I need right away, and I'm immediately happy with the result. Other times what it comes out with is odd or unexpected, and then I might need to either re-think my prompt or perhaps scroll through the handful of potential edits the tool has made to see if one has 'understood' what I'm requesting.

AI: That's a really helpful distinction. When you say the AI sometimes produces something "odd or unexpected," what does that typically look like? Can you give me an example of when that happened?

User: Say I want to remove some text on a sign. I lassoo around the text and then ask 'remove text'. Instead of the text going and the background color remaining, the AI tool might create some weird alien text of its own. This is obviously not what I was looking for.

AI: That sounds frustrating when it misinterprets what you're trying to accomplish. When something like that happens - like getting weird alien text instead of a clean removal - how do you typically handle it?

User: I might change the way I phrase the prompt and see if this produces different results. Failing that, I would need to do the cleanup manually.

AI: That makes sense - adjusting your approach and having that manual fallback. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain photo editing tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I am nervous about it creating anything entirely from whole cloth- I wouldn't want a client to be angry that something has been 'faked'. Anything that could be overly noticeable or creative I would tend to avoid.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - being mindful of client expectations and authenticity. It sounds like there's a clear line for you between cleanup work and creation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you discuss these tools with other videographers or photographers?

User: I do discuss the tool with my work partner - we noticed its rollout with interest and had a play around with the tool when we got the update, testing its abilities and limitations.

AI: That's great that you and your partner explored it together. When you were testing its abilities and limitations, what did you discover that surprised you - either positively or negatively?

User: I was impressed by its ability to remove text from backgrounds, and other basic tasks, cleanly and easily. I was less impressed by some of its more, say, surreal approaches to creating elements in images. Say if you want to add a hand hugging a person in an image, you could get all sorts of weird results.

AI: That really illustrates the difference between those cleanup tasks versus creative generation. You mentioned testing with your work partner - did you both end up adopting similar approaches to using the tool, or do you use it differently from each other?

User: We do use it the same, I would say.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used it on a photograph of a theme park where there were loads of fairly ugly safety signs visible. I was able to remove them all very convincingly and it really improved my workflow for that particular set of images.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying result - being able to clean up multiple elements efficiently. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't believe at the moment that it threatens my work in any meaningful way. While it can help with some more repetitive tasks, its still limited and absolutely needs a human eye to control for any missteps.

AI: That's a confident perspective - seeing it more as assistance than replacement. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use these tools, or staying pretty much where you are now?

User: I would be interested to see how AI tools can assist with my video work, although I imagine many of those are a way off yet. It could be interesting if I could create free to use music with specific feels in the future as well.

AI: Those are some really interesting possibilities - especially the music creation aspect for your video work. That could solve some practical challenges around licensing.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on drawing clear boundaries around authenticity and client expectations - that seems like such an important consideration in creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for cleanup work while being mindful of authenticity, and your collaborative approach to exploring these tools with your work partner, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
