Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments, and anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI for researching technological solutions, analysing technical configuration files for web, app and database servers, analysing log files, and finding well-sourced answers to compliance and legal questions relevant for my business. I don't use it that often, but it is slowly replacing manual web research in my day-to-day work life. If my primary software product was in active development, I would be using it as a coding assistance - and I intend to do so in future.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of technical and research tasks. You mentioned that AI is slowly replacing manual web research for you. 

Can you walk me through what that transition has looked like? What made you start turning to AI instead of doing that research yourself?

User: I've found web search quality to be in decline for at least 7 years now, and the proliferation of SEO copy, pop-ups and overlays, and now automated slop posts has made web research quite tedious. When seeking answers to technical questions, conflicting and incorrect answers abound. To solve these problems, I exhaustively research everything before it reaches a production system, or I take a consequential financial or compliance-related action. Performing the same task with AI allows the agent to perform the research, sourcing and synthesis for me, and I can evaluate and follow-up as necessary. I still don't trust it overall - yet - and am only comfortable when I have sufficient knowledge to interrogate the results (and make sure they pass the "smell" test).

AI: That's a fascinating perspective on the decline of web search quality. You mentioned that you still don't trust AI overall yet, but you're comfortable when you have sufficient knowledge to interrogate the results.

Tell me more about that evaluation process - what does it look like when you're checking whether AI results pass your "smell test"?

User: Pure instinct based on experience. I've worked in tech or tech-adjacent roles for 20 years, and run my own business for more than 11 of those. You develop a sense for coherence and soundness that serves us humans quite well!

AI: That makes perfect sense - two decades of experience gives you a solid foundation to work from.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several types of tasks you use it for, but are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I haven't done any new product development for a while, but it's conceivable I will in future. I actively enjoy the product design and research process, and especially the nitty gritty of web layout. Ideation and development of product-market fit is also a form of creative inspiration I enjoy. I would likely continue performing those tasks myself and with colleagues, as this is the satisfaction of creating products for customers. I don't necessarily see AI as a source of the unique inspiration required to build a successful product from scratch. Though I daresay I could see myself using it to write some CSS for me! My business also needs to provide email customer service, and I have mixed feelings about AI there, which we can talk about if we have time.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's a clear distinction for you between the creative, strategic work that drives satisfaction versus the more mechanical implementation tasks.

When you do use AI for those technical tasks like analyzing config files or researching compliance questions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: No, I'll paste in some log data and ask for pattern recognition. Compliance questions usually revolve around tax treatments or legal obligations of data protection and disclosures under various pieces of legislation in the UK.

AI: So it sounds like you're giving AI fairly self-contained chunks of work - here's the log data, find the patterns, or here's my compliance question, give me the legal framework.

When you get those results back, what happens next? Do you typically take the AI's analysis and run with it, or does it usually lead to more back-and-forth?

User: I digest it, check the sources, usually ask two follow-ups on average to drill down to specific points. Popular models seem to be serving this type of function quite well at this point. It's becoming a natural workflow, and more enjoyable than manual web research. Perhaps it's a novelty that's worn off yet? But if AI's ability to draw more and more authoritative, reliable conclusions improves, then why would I go back to trawling forums, product guides, Q&A sites, release notes, and buglists, and so forth?

AI: That's a compelling point about the trajectory of improvement versus the declining quality of traditional search. You touched on something interesting - you said it's becoming a natural workflow and more enjoyable than manual research.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you run your own business, I'm curious how that dynamic works for you.

User: I work with freelancers only so that doesn't really factor in to my work. Everyone is independent and can decide how they deliver their own work product when it comes to the way I work. I handle all business-centric decisions and am solely accountable.

AI: That gives you a lot of autonomy in how you choose to integrate AI into your processes.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yeah, I sometimes have singular, specific questions about configuring some relatively niche software - like say an edge case around a setting in a third-party caching module for a popular web server. Popular models still hallucinate answers that I know to be false straight away, because I've already made those mistakes and am trying to work around them. Sometimes the official documentation on this kind of product is dire, and user-generated content is conflicting or vague. If AI gets it wrong, I waste time, and I'm back to square one.

AI: That frustration makes complete sense - especially when you've already been down those wrong paths before and you're specifically trying to avoid repeating those mistakes.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Absolutely. Any future business or product venture will require a decidedly analogue component - with physical dependency on objects and humans. Many professionally, technically and scientifically competent people will continue to innovate in the digital realm, and remain ahead of AI, but I wouldn't like to wager my own money on those outcomes.

AI: That's a really strategic way of thinking about it - actively positioning yourself toward physical and human-dependent work rather than trying to compete directly with AI capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Each year, it becomes more and more burdensome to run a small business. Tax and regulatory complexity grows in such a way that it affects small operators the most. For me personally, an AI agent that could actively engage in performing routine accounting, tax, and compliance tasks would improve my life considerably. I'm in two minds about agentic customer service. On the one hand, it could improve customer experience for any business. On the other, the personalised business relationship is a small business's USP, in comparison to a large Enterprise, which struggles to deliver relationship-based account management to small clients. Unfortunately, as impersonal AI-driven service becomes the norm, I fear consumers will progressively devalue personal service, and sideline small businesses.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the strategic shift toward physical and human-dependent work, and that nuanced view of how AI might help with compliance tasks while potentially undermining the personal service advantage that small businesses have.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, we've had a good conversation. I enjoyed it.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. You've provided some really valuable insights about the practical realities of integrating AI into business operations, especially from the perspective of someone running their own company. Your thoughts on the evolving landscape for small businesses and the strategic considerations around where to compete versus where to leverage AI will be incredibly helpful for our research.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the benefits and limitations you've encountered. Thanks again!
