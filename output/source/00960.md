Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, you can begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a teacher in a school so I use AI a lot in my typical workday. I use it to help create lesson plans, plan activities for my students and a bunch of other stuff. I even use it to help make slide decks for teacher workshops

AI: That sounds like AI is playing a pretty significant role in your teaching work. When you mention creating lesson plans and activities - could you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: Sure. So let's say I have to teach a lesson on concrete and abstract nouns for a grade 4 english class. I would usually have the outline of my teaching content set up from the standards and textbook, but I would need creative ideas to integrate it into an activity that the students would enjoy and help them retain the information. So I would use an AI model to help come up with tasks or I'd input some basic lesson content and ask it to arrange it into a lesson plan document or a slide deck with timed intervals for each slide. Something like that would be my typical process

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you have your content foundation sorted, and then AI helps you with the creative implementation and formatting. 

Tell me more about that creative part - when you're looking for activities that students would enjoy and that help with retention. How do you work with AI on that piece?

User: I would ask the model something like "give me 3 creative activities I could use for a grade 4 grammar lesson on concrete and abstract nouns" and then i'd probably pick the one I like best

AI: I see - so you're getting options from AI and then making the final choice yourself. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to use AI as a creative jumping off point. Or something to get the juices flowing. If it suggests 3 activities, I might pick one and then edit it to be more specific and approptiate to my target audience. I think these tasks are different because for me as the teacher, I know my students better than any AI model coudl

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you know your specific students and what will work for them in ways that AI simply can't.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate. If i want to delegate something completely, it would probably be something that doesnt require creativity like arranging a student names list or something

AI: That's interesting - so the more creative and student-specific the work, the more you stay involved in the process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Everyone in my workplace uses AI to help them plan their lessons, so it's very common now

AI: So it sounds like AI use is pretty normalized in your school environment. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can share a time where it made me frustrated. I was writing a research paper and I needed some citations, so I asked the model to give me some research journals I could look up and read. It gave me a list, but then I couldnt find like 90% of them because they were fabricated. So it bothered me that the model made up the references instead of guiding me to real research that exists.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to do legitimate research and you can't trust the information you're getting. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider this. I've reached a point where I can immediately tell if something is AI written or not, and I'm assuming a lot of other people who use it have as well. Using AI in 100% of your work is frowned upon in the creative community (writing, creating content, etc.) so I feel that my skills of extracting the information and editing it to be specific to my needs is a skill that AI hasn't taken over yet.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like you see your ability to recognize AI output and skillfully adapt it as a valuable skill in itself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it might evolve in the sense that the model will have a better memory when it comes to how each user uses it and will output more specific responses than just general information

AI: That's fascinating - you're envisioning AI that learns and adapts to your specific teaching style and needs over time.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI as a creative jumping-off point while maintaining your expertise about what works for your specific students.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative creative partner while maintaining your core teaching expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
