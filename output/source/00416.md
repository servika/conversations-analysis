Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good, lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it mainly for explaining things, such as Postgres behaviour and Golang behaviour. I will also ask it to provide some code snippets if I want to get the most optimal solution, or the most idiomatic one.

AI: That's helpful context - so you're working with databases and Go programming. 

When you mention asking for explanations of Postgres or Golang behavior, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? What prompts you to turn to AI for those explanations rather than other resources?

User: For example, I recently asked 'does where stop things going into a join is that what having is for?'. The main benefit is how I can word a question with casual language which is not precise or perfectly correct but the AI understands. This is a huge plus over web search which needs specific keywords to trigger results. It is always much, much faster at getting results for coding then web searching.

AI: That's a really interesting point about the casual language - being able to ask imprecise questions and still get useful answers. 

Tell me more about that speed advantage you mentioned. When you say it's much faster than web searching for coding, what does that difference feel like in practice during your workday?

User: Its a huge plus. Instead of the frustration of trawling through endless stack overflow posts for the specific issue or help you need, you can immediately get very specific help without having to put much effort into wording your question. It helps productivity and mainly prevents losing the 'flow state' that is easy to lose when searching the web and getting stuck.

AI: That flow state preservation sounds really significant for your work. You mentioned getting stuck when web searching - that resonates.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to do the majority of the work myself and focus only on smaller, precise issues. I like to structure my code to fit my work's repo and style, including variable/function naming conventions and usage of structs and interfaces, and then use Ai to help me with smaller things like sorting efficiently or data structures.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping the bigger architectural decisions in your hands while getting help with specific technical pieces.

When you do use AI for those smaller, precise issues like sorting or data structures, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout solving the problem, or do you tend to ask for what you need and then take that solution and run with it independently?

User: It depends. Sometimes I will go back and forth if the result is not helped me understand or is not close enough to the correct output. However, if I look at the output of the model and it immediately makes more sense to me what I have to do then I will just use the first output and do it independently.

AI: That's a nice adaptive approach - letting the quality of the first response guide whether you need more interaction.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any discussion or guidance around AI usage at your company?

User: So AI usage is very limited at our company. We do not input our own code into the models, but we are allowed to use as I do, asking about specific problems in written language. i don't know how many other people use it, I think it is relatively limited in its uptake right now.

AI: Interesting - so there are some boundaries around what code you can share, but you're able to use it for general technical questions. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It has made me feel satisfied when I have been struggling on a problem for a while and it immediately gives me clarity. For example, recently it really helped in structuring some CTEs in postgres. It has been frustrating sometimes though when it refuses to change its code/output even though I have pointed out it is incorrect. It sometimes jsut gets stuck thinking it is definitely correct.

AI: That CTE example sounds like a perfect use case - getting unstuck when you've been wrestling with something. And I can see how it would be frustrating when it digs in on an incorrect solution.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not hugely. I know it is a threat to software engineers but I don't think it will be capable of delivering well-structured but more importantly secure code for quite a long time. It will be more efficient to employ a developer than use AI for a while to come.

AI: That perspective on security and well-structured code is thoughtful - you see those as key differentiators that will keep developers relevant.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll change how you use it or what you use it for?

User: I think so. AI is getting more and more integrated into IDEs and so it will be hard to avoid I think. Also, we are starting to use AI apis in our product, which I think will get people a bit more excited about it. I don't think we will be allowed to put our code in it anytime soon, but I don't mind that. i want to maintain my ability to write good code and not heavily rely on AI for everything.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a precision tool for specific problems while maintaining control over the larger architectural decisions - that balance seems really intentional.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thats it

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining core development skills, and especially that point about preserving flow state, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your approach with me today.

User: No worries, thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and thanks again for contributing to our research.
