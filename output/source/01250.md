Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Sure, a recent research project I've done was building a pediatric cardiac shape atlas from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging models. I used an automated pipeline that performs the segmentation, landmark detection, and guidepoint processing and fitting automatically. This was the first normative reference dataset of pediatric hearts. We analyzed the interpatient differences and have been comparing the use of using this dataset as a normal reference compared to using an adult atlas as a reference cohort.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work with real clinical implications. You mentioned using an automated pipeline for segmentation, landmark detection, and processing - that's quite a sophisticated workflow.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools beyond the automated pipeline you described?

User: I've used AI to help me build out my manuscript for journal submission, to perform some of the data analysis of the models, and suggest new ideas for analysis that would build off of my preexisting data

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI has touched several different aspects of your research process. Let's dig into one of those areas a bit more.

For the manuscript writing part, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: I asked AI to build on a manuscript that I've previously written. I had lots of other tasks to deal with so I used AI to build out the manuscript for me. I also wanted to have the manuscript be written in a sophisticated voice that matches preexisting journal articles

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a way to extend your existing work while maintaining that professional academic tone. 

Now thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I find that AI struggles with some of the more "niche" parts of my research. There are areas where the AI completely hallucinates potential solutions and doesn't help at all when developing solutions for these issues. It's much faster and a lot more accurate to continue using traditional approaches

AI: That's a really insightful point about AI struggling with the more specialized aspects of your work. When you have used AI - like for the data analysis or manuscript writing that you mentioned earlier - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: It helps often to have other eyes look at what AI produces. I verify the output myself but also use the eyes of my professors to ensure that the data works well and the manuscript writing makes scientific sense.

AI: That collaborative verification approach sounds really practical. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm curious about your future perspective on this.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be helping me revive and use old tools just by looking at the codebase! There's a lot of older tools to use in my area of research that are not well-documented. They often use legacy versions of code and packages and tend to be very difficult for me to figure out how to use.

AI: That's such a practical and specific need - being able to breathe new life into legacy research tools. I can imagine that's a common frustration across many scientific fields where valuable tools exist but the documentation or compatibility has aged out.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into the more specialized versus general aspects of research work, and especially your insights about verification through collaboration, were particularly illuminating. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Overall, I'm super happy with the advances of AI in my field. It has truly advanced and improved my research experience and I'm excited about the future of AI to further revolutionize research.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing that optimistic perspective - it's clear you're seeing real benefits from AI integration in your work. Your insights about the balance between AI's strengths in general tasks like manuscript writing versus its limitations in highly specialized areas were really valuable. And that point about using legacy codebases is something I suspect many researchers can relate to.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about collaborative verification and the practical ways AI is already enhancing your research productivity really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.
