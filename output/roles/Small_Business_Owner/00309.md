Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I really only use AI for business ideas and for clear communication with clients. I have asked it to create promotional flyers and have given it real life scenarios while working with clients and asked it how to handle situations or communicate my needs.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI for both creative work like promotional materials and for interpersonal guidance. 

Can you tell me more about those real-life client scenarios? What does that process typically look like when you're trying to figure out how to handle a situation?

User: If I have a  client who is taking advantage my kindness or wants me to book them for times I am not available or if they are continually late, sometimes I need help wording my boundaries in a respectful but firm way.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application - getting help with that balance between being professional and setting clear boundaries. 

When you're crafting those boundary-setting messages with AI's help, do you typically take the response it gives you and use it as-is, or do you find yourself modifying it to match your own voice and style?

User: For one on one conversations with a client I will modify it to match myself. If it is an announcement going out to all clients I am more likely to use as -is.

AI: That makes sense - personalizing one-on-one messages but using the more polished version for broader communications.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't fully understand what tasks AI could even do for me as a nail tech so I don't really know how to answer that

AI: That's actually really helpful to know - it sounds like you're still discovering what's possible. As a nail tech, you've found these specific uses for business ideas and client communication, but you're not sure what else might be out there.

When you do use AI for those tasks you mentioned - like the boundary-setting messages or promotional flyers - do you find yourself working back and forth with it, refining the output together, or do you tend to give it instructions and let it handle the task completely?

User: More so back and forth as nothing usually comes out exactly as I want it. Often I get ideas and finish the task myself

AI: So it sounds like AI serves more as a starting point or brainstorming partner for you - you get ideas from it and then take over to finish things your way.

How have your colleagues or other nail techs you know influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your field talking about or using these tools?

User: Not specifically other nail techs but I have other friends who own businesses and use it more than I do for communication and creative ideas. I don't know if techs are using AI but often clients will come in with photos of nails they want that are clearly AI generated and I have to tell them that I cannot create it exactly the same because AI doesn't create a design based off of technique or tools available.

AI: That's fascinating - so you're encountering AI from the client side too, where they're bringing you AI-generated designs that aren't actually achievable with real nail techniques.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I get frustrated when I ask it to change something in a photo or even a paragraph it wrote and it changes the wrong thing or more than what I asked to be changed. Also, when words aren't spelled properly in images.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to make specific, targeted changes and it either misses the mark or changes too much at once.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really factor into your thinking given your work as a nail tech?

User: I don't think it could take over. There is too much human interaction that happens in my salon. AI cannot feel and exchange energies with humans. It will always miss the mark

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the human connection and energy exchange being something fundamentally irreplaceable in your work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself exploring new ways to use it, or staying pretty much with what you're doing now?

User: For now, it seems I won't use it beyond what I'm already using it for.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the human connection and energy exchange in your salon can't be replicated by AI - that's such an important aspect of service work that often gets overlooked.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point for communication and creative work, the challenges with client expectations around AI-generated nail designs, and especially your thoughts on the irreplaceable human elements of your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
