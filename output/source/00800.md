Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. Let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical work day, AI will be consulted multiple times to either provide solutions to programming problems or to verify and or improve existing code.

AI: That's interesting - you mention both problem-solving and code verification. When you say AI is "consulted multiple times," can you walk me through what that actually looks like during your day? How do these moments typically come up?

User: For example, at the moment I am updating an existing code base. Creating new UI layer that is based on the Microsoft's Blazor technology as well as cleaning up the existing business layer. As I am working on this project, I will sometimes prompt the AI with some existing code so that it can improve it or generate new Blazor UI code to work with that code.

AI: That gives me a good picture of your current project. When you're working on something like updating that codebase, how do you decide which parts to bring to AI versus which parts you handle entirely on your own? What goes through your mind when you're making that choice?

User: Most of the time when there is a need to create some Blazor UI code, I usually consult the AI. It is easier to modify what the AI produces rather than starting from nothing. The AI is also consulted when there is some known performance issues in code related certain parts of the application. I will also consult the AI whenever I am curious if there is a better way to code something other than what I have written or know how to write.

AI: It sounds like you've developed a pretty specific sense of when AI is most useful to you. Tell me more about that process of modifying what the AI produces - what does that typically involve? Are you making small tweaks or more substantial changes?

User: Usually if it is UI code then I will make it more modular or I will move it to the correct files or locations. And since I am not prompting the AI with the entire code base, it's actually not the fault of the AI that it does not already do that for me. If it's some logic then I may or may not only take parts of what I like or feel should be incorporated into the existing project.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - recognizing the limitations of what you can share with the AI and working within those constraints. When you say you might only take parts of the logic the AI suggests, how do you evaluate what feels right to incorporate versus what doesn't? What's driving those decisions?

User: It's usually if I feel that the AI has produced code that is more elegant than what I have. In essence, if it's more efficient, more modular, more succinct, etc.

AI: That makes sense - you're looking for those improvements in efficiency and elegance. When you use AI for work like this, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout working on a piece of code, or do you tend to give it a task and then work independently with what it produces?

User: I will kind of depend. Sometimes I will need to go back and forth with the AI if what I use from the AI encounters any kind of bugs or other issues. And sometimes I will just work independently with what it produces if what it produced requires a significant amount of integration with my existing code base.

AI: That flexibility in your approach is interesting. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Is this something that's discussed openly, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: I am working with one other colleague and we pretty much use AI in the same way.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It's definitely a time saver and way less tedious to prompt the AI with some code that has a bug and let AI immediately point out what the issue is, rather than possibly spending hours trying to zero in on what is causing the bug. Debugging is always satisfying and frees me from frustration when using AI.

AI: That's a great example - it really highlights how AI can remove some of those time-consuming roadblocks. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I am always thinking about that and it would seem that with how intuitive AI is getting, the only roles that would eventually be left for human programmers would be for highly specialized individuals such as architects or high level designers. I feel that I am already close to being obsolete and that in order to remain in this industry I would have to specialize.

AI: That's a really honest perspective, and it sounds like you're actively thinking about this transition. When you think about specializing to stay relevant, what areas are you considering? What draws you toward architecture or high-level design specifically?

User: It appears that AI will become so intuitive that the writing of code or the fine details will no longer be in issue and could be handled by AI and that more big picture architects will be what's needed when it comes to software development.

AI: Looking ahead then, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Given your thoughts about moving toward that big-picture architectural role, how do you see your interaction with AI tools changing?

User: Instead of providing the AI with fine details and code, it may be that the AI will simply be provided models that it would have to work with and from that it would create entire systems based on prompted requirements.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your candid perspective on how the industry might evolve and your strategic thinking about specialization.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thank you, no. I enjoyed our conversation.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about debugging, the evolution toward architectural roles, and how you've adapted your workflow to work with AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were in describing both the practical aspects of your daily work and the bigger picture implications you're considering. Have a great rest of your day!
