Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I have no questions yet.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: As a current mechanical engineering student have done a few research project recently. One that comes to mind was trying to explore whether or not 3D printing could be used for low-cost energy efficient heat exchangers. The initial idea came from using my personal computer and noticing the GPU would frequently overheat when performing heavy tasks. I started researching different cooling designs and the efficiency of them. I created a couple models in CAD and ran simulations to compare data. After determining the best design I 3d printed it and set up a simple test rig. The final output was not perfect but it was a real prototype that worked as a heat exchanger.

AI: That's a really interesting project - going from a personal frustration with GPU overheating to actually creating a working prototype. I can see how that would involve multiple stages from research and design to testing.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools to help me research and to help me create the models in CAD, using LLM to trouble shoot if  I hit a road block.

AI: That's helpful to know you used AI for research and CAD modeling troubleshooting. Can you tell me more about that research phase specifically - what kind of information were you looking for and how did the AI help you find or understand it?

User: I used AI to assist me in researching more basic background knowledge, and design inspiration. I find that using AI can help me think of new ideas and get over a creative block. The bulk of my research was done without AI.

AI: That's really insightful - using AI more as a starting point and creative catalyst rather than for the heavy lifting of research. 

When you hit those roadblocks in CAD and turned to an LLM for troubleshooting, how did you decide to use AI versus reaching out to a professor, classmate, or searching through forums and documentation?

User: It was the fastest and easiest solution I could find. I was working by myself late at night figured  I could give AI a shot for trouble shooting. I find that searching through forums and documentation can take lots of precious time and its not guaranteed you are going to find what you are looking for.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the immediacy and availability when you're working odd hours is a real advantage. 

We're about one-third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your heat exchanger project where you didn't use AI - like the simulations, the actual 3D printing, or setting up the test rig - what kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: Biggest thing that kept me from using AI was the capability of it. Although that's not the only thing, I am trying to learn about this topic and understand it best that I can, as a student I want to perform a lot of the work manually and I do not want AI tools to replace/ assist me on everything yet.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - balancing the learning aspect with practical efficiency. It sounds like there's both a technical limitation piece and a deliberate educational choice you're making.

When you did use AI for troubleshooting those CAD issues, how did you verify or validate the solutions it suggested to make sure they would actually work?

User: There was some trial and error, most of the trouble shooting was nothing major. I was able to immediately test the solution it provided. If it did not work, then I would engage with the LLM and try to work out the solution.

AI: That iterative approach makes sense - being able to test quickly and then refine with the AI if needed.

We're about halfway through now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: That's a great question. If I could have AI immediately be able to help with one aspect of my research it would be on the experimenting and testing side. There is a lot of repetition with connecting sensors. gathering data, and analyzing it. If AI was able to assist in that it could be a huge time saver.

AI: That's fascinating - automating the more repetitive, hands-on aspects of data collection and analysis. It sounds like that could free up time for the higher-level thinking and design work.

Thinking about the parts where you did use AI - the research and CAD troubleshooting - what determines when you choose to use AI versus sticking with your traditional approach? Is it just about speed, or are there other factors that influence that decision?

User: Speed is an important factor but that's not the only one. I like to be hands on with a lot of stuff and truly understand it. If there is an aspect that I do not know a lot about, I would rather do it the traditional way first so that I can have a real understanding of it, before I would use AI to assist or accomplish that task.

AI: That's a really mature approach to learning - making sure you build that foundational understanding first before introducing AI as an efficiency tool.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions - your perspective on using AI strategically while prioritizing hands-on learning has been particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about balancing AI efficiency with hands-on learning really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work - especially that thoughtful approach of wanting to master fundamentals before letting AI assist with tasks.

Your point about wanting AI to help with the repetitive experimental aspects while keeping the creative and learning-intensive parts more hands-on was particularly valuable for us to hear.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
