Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No that sounds good, let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well I work retail, just on the shop floor in a store, so it's not that common right now. I use it for little things sometimes, we have a garden centre and it has been really useful for identifying plants for customers. I wished we used it more, honestly.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to help identify plants for customers sounds quite practical. 

Tell me more about that plant identification process. How does that typically work when a customer approaches you?

User: Well sometimes we'll need to get a price for a plant if the label has fallen off, and since I'm not a botanist, I have no idea most of the time. It's incredibly useful to just be able to snap a picture and instantly know all of the information about the plant.

AI: That sounds like it saves you a lot of time and probably makes you more helpful to customers too.

You mentioned you wished you used AI more at work. What other situations come up on the shop floor where you think AI could be helpful but you're not currently using it?

User: Well it's not really for my job, it's more for management. I feel they often try to get their hands stuck in to all of these things but just don't plan efficiently and are always getting confused about who needs to be in when, things like that. I feel like there's so many ways they could use AI to make things more efficient. And just using it to remove choice paralysis would be great. They always write handovers to the next supervisor and stuff, or these little to-do lists they cobble together. They'd save so much time if they added essentially another manager to delegate and just create some inertia.

AI: It sounds like you see a clear disconnect between where AI could actually help versus where it's being used - or not used - in your workplace.

When you think about your managers struggling with scheduling, handovers, and to-do lists, what do you think holds them back from using AI for those kinds of tasks?

User: Computer literacy, mostly. And just lack of understanding how much it could help. They could probably create programs to do half of the admin stuff they do in a fraction of the time. They could hand around a sheet and everyone fills in their availability and then they could scan all the sheets and have AI create rotas that meet everyone's needs with sufficient store cover. I think it really is just a problem in that they don't know what their missing, unknown unknowns so to speak. They're just not wired to apply it to tasks the way I feel like I am now. Actually, that reminds me, I had to cut some artificial grass off a big roll in the garden centre.  We sell grass in meters but the customer had the size they needed in feet, and I used AI to do the maths for me and calculate the cost and it worked perfectly.

AI: That's a great example with the artificial grass calculation - it shows how naturally you think to use AI as a tool in the moment when you need it.

It sounds like there's a real difference between how you approach AI and how your managers do. What do you think shaped your comfort with thinking "I can use AI for this" in those situations?

User: Well I use AI a lot anyway, and I'm just computer literate. It's part of my muscle memory to go to AI for certain questions. I don't really like having AI write for me, but I like having advanced reasoning in my pocket.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - wanting the reasoning but not the writing. 

Can you tell me more about what you mean by that? What makes you prefer to keep the writing yourself while using AI for the reasoning part?

User: I tend to use AI as a sort of journal that can talk back, and I bounce ideas off of it a lot. But I also use it for things that I could do myself but would take me ages, like a personal assistant. For example, I work out, and I've been trying to focus on my macros lately. So I told AI to make me a shopping list to a value of £65 that has protein/fat/carbs to a similar ratio as my macro targets. And just like that, it's done, with recipe ideas and everything. That's the kind of thing I wish my managers would do with it. Not that specifically, obviously, but like I said before. Just remove that choice paralysis and dilly dallying and just get actionable things ready to go with reasoning behind them. Even if you just gave it a list of staff and told it each of their strengths, and then took a picture of the warehouse and had it delegate pallets or cages to work through. I'd love to just experiment with it and see what things could be sped up. Even if there was some failed experiments, it'd be really interesting to me.

AI: That shopping list example really captures what you're describing - having AI handle the complex calculations and planning while you retain control over the decisions and actions.

You mentioned wanting to experiment with AI at work and see what could be sped up. Have you ever brought any of these ideas to your managers, or is it more something you think about but haven't discussed with them?

User: No, I just don't think they'd get it. Too much "I'm a manager and I know best" hubris. I think that can be true, but I also know that humans are fallible and you can often just use some kind of effective algorithm and get better results.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like there's a cultural barrier there beyond just the technical knowledge gap.

When you're using AI in those moments at work, like with the plant identification or the grass calculations, how do your colleagues react? Do they notice or ask about it, or is it more something you do quietly?

User: I don't think anyone has seen me. I don't hide it or do it quietly in an intentional way, but they would probably just think I was checking a text or something.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When it comes to tasks, I like using AI to replace the parts of my mind I don't feel attached to. Formal writing, for example, where you have to speak robotically anyway, I'm like, go ahead. Calculations, too. Busy work, grunt work, crunching information. That stuff I let AI do. But things like texting family, or writing for fun, I do myself. I suppose it comes down to tasks that involve emotion or passion. The idea of having AI text on behalf of me to a family member is very weird to me. But sending a professional email? That doesn't bother me.

AI: That's a really clear way to think about it - tasks that involve emotion or passion staying with you, while the more mechanical parts can go to AI.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Whenever I've used it at work it's been a simple picture upload. I don't get much opportunity on the shop floor.

AI: That makes sense - the shop floor environment is probably quite different from having extended back-and-forth conversations with AI.

But thinking about your personal use where you mentioned bouncing ideas off it like a journal - when you do have those longer interactions, do you tend to work through problems together step by step, or do you give it a complete request and let it handle everything?

User: It depends on the task. The shopping list is just iterating on it but is very impersonal. Other times it's more about a second opinion, just having feedback on an idea, and going back and forth. Right now I'm very interested in philosophy, so I like to use it to engage in Socratic questioning with me. It really depends on the task. But I think I'm having trouble giving a direct answer because the honest answer is, all of the above. I use it a lot, in a lot of ways.

AI: That variety makes perfect sense - it sounds like you've developed a really flexible relationship with AI where you adapt your approach based on what you need in the moment.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It has always been fine at work, just calculations and pictures. Honestly it was genuinely satisfying and felt like a "we're living in the future" moment the first time I identified a plant, it took a few seconds and gave me details about care and everything. It felt like when they download skills in The Matrix.

AI: That's such a vivid way to describe it - that "downloading skills" feeling. It sounds like that moment really captured the potential you see in AI as a tool.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think I'm lucky in that I have a theory that AI will usher in an age for people with brains like mine. ADHD, broadly skilled under achievers, who have potential but can't quite apply it. I think AI is most effectively used by holistic thinkers. It super charges ADHD hyperfocus because you suddenly have an expert to talk to about any new thing you pick up.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as particularly well-suited to complement the way your mind works rather than replace it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think things will change in your retail environment, or are you thinking more about other work contexts?

User: I want to see it integrated more at work, if not by me then by management. I don't think it will happen any time soon though, these things seem to take a long time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as "advanced reasoning in your pocket" and how you think about it complementing rather than replacing the parts of your mind you feel attached to.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's good.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical applications you've found, the barriers you see to broader adoption, and how you think about which tasks to delegate versus keep for yourself will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
