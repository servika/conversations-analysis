Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I often use AI for brainstorming tasks and writing tasks in my typical workday. Recently, a lot of my work has been in document and system creation, so when I feel like I can't word something properly, I've been using AI to help me get the wording correct. I've done the same for emails as that is also a primary part of my role.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you mention using AI to "get the wording correct" for documents or emails, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you approach that interaction?

User: Often, I already had either a rough draft of what I'm writing or enough details/framework of what I want, to give that as a jumping off point for the AI. I try to be really specific in what I'm asking for, but it'll sometimes take a couple of rounds to either get what I want or to get something that I feel like I can edit into what I want it to be.

AI: That iterative process you describe is interesting. Tell me more about those rounds of back-and-forth - what typically needs adjusting as you work through those iterations?

User: Typically just language. Often the language feels too forced, like the model is trying too hard to be "cool". So, it's a lot of language shuffling. Sometimes it's reiterating instructions that I didn't give enough clarity on.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I work a lot with Notion at my current job, which technically has a built in AI, but the entire workspace has to pay for it, which they aren't willing to do. So, it feels tricker to utilize an outside AI for some of those tasks (data updating, task creation, project management) because it lives inside it's own Notion-world, if that makes sense. Sometimes, instead of trying to remove hints from Notion, bring them to AI, and then bring them back feels too troublesome, so then I just do the work myself. So, it's more the hassle of bringing the tasks to AI that makes me do them myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the friction of moving work between different systems. Beyond those logistical barriers though, are there any types of tasks where you actively choose to do the work yourself even when it would be easy to use AI? What drives those decisions?

User: I've been working a lot on curriculum building for my position this year, but I've done most of that one my own or with my team. Because that's something that's so key to the values and training opportunities of my organization, it feels strange to bring AI in. I want the curriculum to have heart and personality behind it, so I haven't really utilized AI for that creation. I've used to to help with some wording when I feel like I can't get it quite right, but, otherwise, I feel competent enough to not use any sort of AI for it. I suppose, I mostly use AI if I feel like it can either do a better or quicker job than I can. But, with curriculum building, I feel competent enough in my own skills. Also, having to layout the foundation of the curriculum to the AI model feels more daunting and annoying than just doing it myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making about curriculum building - keeping that core work close because of the values and personality aspect. When you do use AI for work tasks, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'd say most of my task flow with AI is more collaborative. I've not given it a ton of independent tasks, though I'd like the grow in doing that moving forward. I know there are a lot of little day-to-day tasks that I could delegate, I just need to do more research on how to get there.

AI: What's holding you back from delegating those complete tasks right now? Is it more about figuring out the technical aspects, or are there other considerations?

User: It's almost entirely just needing to figure out the technical aspects. I just need to spend a little bit of time researching how AI can do those tasks before I can pass them off successfully.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Ah, good question. There's one specific person at work who is ALWAYS using AI for things, and I feel like you can tell in their document creation (HR policies, meeting notices, announcements). So, I've tried to be really intentional to utilize AI without making it seem like I'm using AI. I want the time-benefits out utilizing AI without people noticing it, if that makes sense. Otherwise, my colleagues seem to be generally open to AI and its tools, so it's encouraging to learn from each other.

AI: That's really interesting - you want the efficiency benefits but prefer that the AI assistance isn't obvious in the final output. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Generally, when utilizing AI for my job, I feel pretty satisfied. I will note, whenever brainstorming names for things (teachings, workshops, chapter titles, etc.) the suggestions always feel rather cheesy. I haven't quite learn how to write successful prompts and follow-ups that don't make the model suggest cheesy, forced options, but I haven't quite figured it out. Often, I take the suggestions and do some playing around on my own to actually craft something worthwhile. But, generally, I feel like the naming suggestions are rather unhelpful. It feels more like a robot trying to pretend to be human, but like an 80s dad with poor jokes, than actual helpful suggestions. Solely in naming, in other areas it's super helpful.

AI: That's such a specific and vivid description - the "80s dad with poor jokes" really paints a picture! How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This is something I consider. As someone in an administrative role, I see the different areas where AI could definitely start doing my job, which makes me not only nervous for my finances, but also for my feelings of success. I love repetitive, simple tasks (spreadsheet building, note-taking, envelope folding, etc) because they make me feel successful. So, it can be scary to think of not getting to do those things in the future. Where will I then find success?

AI: That concern about losing those sources of satisfaction and success is really understandable. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Like I briefly mentioned earlier, I'd love to learn more about how to use AI to take some of the "boring" tasks off of my plate (email sending, task creation, and project management), so that I can do the things that I actually enjoy: database building, training people, and going on humanitarian outreach trips. Ideally, I'd like to find ways to use AI to complete the things I don't like about my job, so that I can focus on the things that I do like about my job.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to use AI strategically - getting the efficiency benefits without it being obvious, and your honest reflection about both the excitement and anxiety around AI potentially changing your role.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: There's not anything additional that I can think of.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between collaboration and delegation, the importance of maintaining authenticity in your work, and how you think about skill development in an AI-integrated workplace will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful and honest you were throughout our conversation. Take care!
