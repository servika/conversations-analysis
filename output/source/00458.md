Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, no questions here. Sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I tend to use AI for repetitive tasks, like converting data into tables or pulling data from tables. I do a lot of specific information review, so having specific information highlighted for me to focus on is a big help. I do also use it for some email assistance to make sure I didn't forget anything and get all the information across clearly and professionally.

AI: That's helpful - it sounds like you're using AI across a few different areas. When you mention "specific information review" and having information highlighted for you, can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? What kind of information are you typically reviewing?

User: I review performance output to make sure it matches what's required from the workers. I can't give specifics about that, but I check a lot of things over the course of a day, so having things grouped by specific priorities makes my day easier.

AI: That makes sense - having AI help organize and prioritize what you need to focus on sounds like it streamlines your review process quite a bit. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to use AI for writing pointers and to make sure I don't forget details, but actually writing the emails is something I prefer to do. To me, that feels like the best division of tasks. I'm reviewing specific people's performance, so my review findings should come from me.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction you're making - using AI as a support tool for organization and detail-checking, but keeping the actual writing and judgment calls as your own work. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: The tasks I use AI for are mostly the simple and repetitive ones that can be delegated completely. It would be nice to have more functions available, but my company has a list of specific AI tools and resources we're allowed to use, and right now none of those have the functionality needed for the more complex tasks.

AI: So it sounds like you're currently doing complete task delegation for the simpler work, but company restrictions are limiting your ability to use AI for more complex collaboration. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: That's exactly it. As for my colleagues and workplace culture, the company does encourage us to use the available tools, and one way that my team and I use AI together is keeping track of notes from our meetings as we discuss options and various topics. That's built into our communication software at this point, so it's easy and helpful to use, especially for those of us who might have trouble keeping track of everything being said.

AI: It sounds like your company has taken a pretty thoughtful approach - encouraging use within certain boundaries and integrating AI into your meeting workflows. That meeting note-taking feature seems particularly valuable for your team collaboration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The most frustrating time using AI was definitely one day while working on sending out a lot of emails. For some reason the assistant was certain a word I kept needing to use was misspelled and tried to correct me every time, but I knew the word was spelled correctly. It would remember for each email after I declined the suggestion, but didn't remember from email to email.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're working through a lot of similar emails and the AI keeps making the same incorrect suggestion without learning from your corrections. It must have slowed down what should have been a straightforward task.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: That definitely is something I consider and worry about at times. The pattern analysis portion of my work could eventually be left to AI rather than needing my skills. But at the same time, a lot of my job requires a human's ability to make complex decisions and judgement calls. The slightest difference in how something is worded can be the difference between acceptable or not. So I think the most likely outcome is AI becoming a tool to use with those analysis portions of my work, while I get to focus more on the human side of things

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing both the potential for AI to handle pattern analysis while also seeing the irreplaceable value of human judgment, especially around those nuanced decisions where context and subtle differences matter so much.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Hopefully, more capable and powerful assistants become available to me, so that I can use AI for something other than just the basic task repetition. With the current limitations, there isn't much to evolve

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to maintain the human judgment aspects of your role while seeing AI as a tool for pattern analysis support.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, not that I can think of

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI delegation and human judgment, as well as how workplace restrictions shape AI usage, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
