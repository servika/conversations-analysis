Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I currently use AI for some basic tasks. Mostly revising emails, editing documents and other administrative tasks.

AI: Tell me more about that. When you say revising emails and editing documents, what does that process look like for you?

User: Usually I will create a draft document or email and ask our AI model to review it and suggest any changes. Lately I've been experimenting with having our model create meeting minutes from a transcript of a meeting, but I'm just getting started with that.

AI:

User: Are you still there?

AI: Yes, I'm here! Sorry about that pause. 

That's interesting that you're experimenting with meeting minutes from transcripts. How has that been going so far compared to your more established routine with email and document review?

User: Sometimes the transcripts aren't 100% accurate so that's a bit of a challenge. Also, there is a lot of non-essential discussion during meetings that needs to be weeded out of the minutes. That's what I'm trying to figure out how best to get the model to do.

AI: That sounds like a tricky balance to strike. When the AI is weeding out that non-essential discussion, how do you currently guide it to know what should stay versus what should go?

User: Since I'm at the meeting and I have an idea of what non-essential conversation occurred I try to tell it not to include the discussions related to x, y, z. For example, if someone is talking about their weekend I would say, don't include any conversation about the weekend in the meeting notes.

AI: That makes sense - using your own judgment from being there to guide what gets filtered out. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: At this point I prefer to write requirements documents myself and write test cases myself, but I think that's less of a preference and more that I haven't figured out how to train the model on the nuances of our software application.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like it's more about the AI not having the specific context it would need rather than you wanting to keep those tasks for yourself. 

What would need to happen for you to feel comfortable having AI help with those requirements documents or test cases?

User: I think it would need to be more integrated with our software application so that it was an expert on the application's features. I might be able to provide documentation to train it on the application, but I haven't done that yet.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would be more likely to collaborate with it. For example, I might ask it to draft a response to an email, review it's response and then ask for changes. The changes loop would last until the email is the way I want it.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Our company has provided some basic AI tools, but its still very new. Most of the use is left up to the individual employees. There is no push to get people to start using AI.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've used AI to help me with more complex spreadsheet functions. One time I needed to sort through a bunch of data and I asked the AI model to show me how best to do it. It saved me a lot of time and research.

AI: That sounds like a really helpful experience. What made that interaction work so well for you compared to other times you've used AI?

User: I think it was one of my first experiences trying to get help from AI for my job and I was just relly impressed with how much time was saved by using it.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have considered this, and I still don't have a good answer. I think at this point in time AI is still more of a collaborative tool so employees still need their skills in order for a company to be successful. In the future that might not be the case, but I like to understand how things work so I think I will always want to understand how the model is doing things and maintain my skills just because I want to understand.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect AI to take on more of the day to day administrative tasks while I focus more on the big picture items. I expect it to continue to be a collaboration, but I do think AI will be handling more of the most time consuming tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how it's currently more of a collaboration tool and your thoughtful approach to wanting to understand how things work even as AI takes on more tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. That's all I have.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you walking me through your journey from those early impressive experiences with spreadsheet functions to your current collaborative approach with emails and documents, and your thoughtful experimentation with meeting minutes. Your perspective on maintaining skills while embracing AI as a collaborative tool was particularly valuable.

Have a great rest of your day!
