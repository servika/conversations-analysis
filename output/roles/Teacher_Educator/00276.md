Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: You are now being connected with the person. Start the interview in your next message.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI helps me complete mundane tasks such as compiling information, such as collating information and summarising it. I am involved in a sports club in a voluntary role and it allows me to tally the total number of tickets sold weekly in our draw without using excel

AI: That's really interesting - using AI for both professional and volunteer work tasks. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for tallying those ticket sales. What does that process look like for you?

User: I will typically go to the donations page and copy all the information for that weeks draw. I will paste it into an AI platform and ask for the total tally of tickets. I will also ask it to randomly draw the winner from all entries.

AI: That's a clever way to streamline what could be a time-consuming manual process. 

When you're working on tasks like this - whether it's the ticket tallies or compiling and summarizing information - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I have other tasks such as doing calculations and figuring out things for my small farm. I find it useful for ideas and for finding relevant equations to use for my calculations, but have found it is too sloppy to let it run the calculations. I will usually let it do it, but double check everything myself, as if I am a teacher correcting homework.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you've made - using AI for the ideas and equations but keeping the actual calculations under your own control. The teacher-student analogy is really telling.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: For example, when I am doing a project on the farm such as sizing a solar panel array for a shed roof, I collaborate on the project and let the AI work through the solution. However, I must double-check everything to make sure there are no mistakes, but there usually is.

AI: You mentioned there usually are mistakes when AI works through solutions like the solar panel sizing. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I was satisfied when I was designing a mounting bracket for solar panels and AI helped me realise I was about to undersize some of the material used which would have led to a failure. One time it left me feeling frustrated was when I was describing field shapes and sizes to help me make best use of strip grazing for a field for livestock, but no matter how I described the simple field shape, the AI could not grasp what I wanted.

AI: That's a really vivid contrast - AI catching a potentially costly engineering mistake versus struggling with what sounds like a straightforward spatial description. 

Tell me more about that strip grazing situation. What was it about describing the field shape that the AI couldn't seem to grasp?

User: I was looking for locations to place fences inside the field to split the field evenly but it was suggesting fence locations which were outside the field.

AI: That must have been incredibly frustrating - asking for internal fence placements and getting suggestions that were literally outside the boundaries.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Some colleagues have found smart ways of interacting with the AI models in ways I have not thought about before such as finding cheaper suppliers for materials online.

AI: That's interesting - learning new applications from colleagues like finding suppliers.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This is not something I actively consider, but thinking about it now, I would like to learn better ways to leverage it to my advantage. For example, I don't have a coding background but I would like to leverage AI to help me write code for automations and APIs in programs such as Excel, Solidworks, Matlab etc.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as a tool to expand into areas like coding that might otherwise be inaccessible without that background.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see that in the future I will be able to use AI in a more proactive way to complete monotonous documentation such as Health and Safety for equipment, and using it for technical cases such as helping to write code for software to complete complex simulations. I realise I may need to edit some of the code which I could do in collaboration with AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that teacher-student relationship you've developed - trusting AI for ideas and frameworks but maintaining oversight on the execution.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think you've covered a lot of the essentials, I suppose the big question mark over using AI for me is how accurate the information coming from it is.

AI: That's such an important point - the accuracy question really seems to be at the heart of how you've learned to work with AI, from double-checking those farm calculations to that frustrating field mapping experience.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your own oversight will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for participating - your perspectives were really valuable. Have a great rest of your day!
