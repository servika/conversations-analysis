Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, all good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: It's mainly for brainstorming. I give the chatbot my ideas, and ask for its opinions, for areas to improve. Sometimes I have specific question, like how to blur the background of a picture in Gimp, or at what price I should sell my items (I own a small online macrame shop). It's kinda random how often I use it, because it's only when I've come up with another idea of products.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI serves as a sounding board for your creative process. When you say you give the chatbot your ideas and ask for opinions, what does that conversation typically look like? Are you sharing detailed descriptions of your macrame products, or is it more about the business side of things?

User: Both. When I created my business, I kept giving it the logo I was working on, so it could tell me if I was going in the right direction, if the result looked good. When I'm working on my products' pictures, I give them to the chatbot too, so I can have advice on how to edit the pictures to make them look better. I also used it when I asked for a business license, to know how to fill the fields, or when creating the listings on Etsy. It also helped me creating the sheet for my inventory.

AI: It sounds like the AI has been involved across many different aspects of building and running your business. When you're working on something like editing product photos or filling out business forms, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI - like having a conversation where you try something, show it the result, then adjust? Or do you tend to get the advice upfront and then go handle the task on your own?

User: For the creative tasks, it's very iterative yes. For the logo, I might have exchanged 50 messages with the chatbot before reaching the final version of the logo. For more administrative stuff, it's more straightforward, maybe because I don't like it, so I wanna be done with it as soon as I can.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - 50 messages for the logo versus getting through administrative tasks quickly. When you're in those longer creative conversations, what keeps you engaged in that back-and-forth process? What makes it worth continuing that extended dialogue rather than just taking the first suggestion and moving on?

User: I guess it's mostly because I go one detail at a time. I tell the chatbot about one particular thing I want to do or change, see its advice, work on it, sometimes ask clarification or complain about the result or the advice not working, and only once I'm satisfied with that detail, I go on with another one. If I give all my questions at once, I know the response won't be detailed enough on each question. Or if I have an issue with one detail and want to follow up on it, the rest of the answer will get lost in the conversation, and I'll have to scroll back up when moving on with another detail, which is annoying. Basically, since I can't "pin" a message, going back to it is annoying, so I prefer to go a step at a time.

AI: That makes complete sense - you've developed a very methodical approach to get the most useful responses. When you mention sometimes complaining about advice not working or getting frustrated with results, how does the AI typically respond to that? Does it adjust its approach when you express that kind of feedback?

User: I tries. It's usually when I ask something specific about Gimp or GSheet. It's like the chatbot doesn't know exactly how the software looks like, and its data is outdated, so it tells me to select an option that doesn't exist. In which case, it usually tries to find more recent information, but it's almost never accurate. So whether I find by myself, or I think about another approach and tell the chatbot to start from scratch and focus on that new idea.

AI: That sounds frustrating when you're trying to get specific technical help. When the AI gives you outdated information about software, and you end up finding the solution yourself or pivoting to a new approach, do you tend to share that solution back with the AI? Or do you just move on once you've solved the problem?

User: Depends on my mood 😅Most of the time, I don't take the time to give feedback, I just move on to the next question. Only when I've found the solution but need help with adjusting it, I'll tell the chatbot about my solution. Like (basic example just for illustration), let's say the chatbot couldn't tell me how to draw a rectangle on Gimp, I finally find the solution on my own, but I can't find how to set the specific size I want. Then, I'll tell the chatbot how I draw the rectangle, and ask how to set the size of it.

AI: That's really practical - using it as a continuation tool when you need to build on what you've figured out. I'm curious about the emotional side of using AI in your work. You mentioned it depends on your mood whether you give feedback. Can you think of a specific time when using AI for your business made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated?

User: It's mostly during the brainstorms or creative processes. When it gives me really good ideas of elements to put in my logo, gives me a pleasant looking picture of a logo for my shop, or when its advice on editing my products' pictures result in great quality pictures, then I'm really satisfied with it. The frustration is never very important, I just move on to something else when something doesn't work out.

AI: It sounds like the creative collaboration really works well for you - those moments when the AI contributes genuinely helpful ideas or improvements must feel quite rewarding. I'm wondering about your colleagues or other people in your network who run small businesses. Do you find yourself talking with them about using AI, or has their approach influenced how you use it at all?

User: I don't know anyone running a small business like me, or using AI for work.

AI: That's interesting - so you've essentially been figuring this all out on your own. As you've been using AI across different aspects of your macrame business, from creative work to admin tasks, have you found yourself thinking about which skills you want to keep developing personally versus areas where you're comfortable relying more on AI assistance?

User: Yeah, I hope I can learn about photography and picture editing thanks to AI. So I won't have to ask for help every time I have pictures to edit for my shop. For boring administrative tasks, however, AI will always be welcome to help me! I prefer to spend more time and energy on making macrame and taking pictures of it rather than creating the listings and keeping the inventory up to date.

AI: That's a clear vision - using AI as a learning partner for photography skills while letting it handle the administrative work you'd rather avoid. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI evolving as your business grows? Do you think your usage patterns might change?

User: I might get more comfortable on the creative side of the business, so I might ask less stuff about that. For the administrative tasks, I think it will stay the same. So I might use AI less with time, but it will still be present.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described your methodical, iterative approach to creative tasks - going detail by detail to get the most useful responses.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience using AI in your macrame business that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all. Happy to help!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a creative collaborator and administrative assistant - and how you've developed your own systematic approach to get the best results - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing about your journey building your macrame business with AI support. Thanks again!
