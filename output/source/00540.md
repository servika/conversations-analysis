Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have questions. I'm ready!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have most frequently used AI assist in generating product description text for selling handmade craft items online.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI for crafting product descriptions. Tell me more about that process. What does a typical interaction look like when you're creating those descriptions?

User: I'll usually start be explaining the details of the product I need a description for. I'll list material type, size of the finished product, and my own suggested uses or purposes for the item. Once AI has generated product description text, I edit that into something that sounds more my style and correct any errors.

AI: That sounds like a collaborative workflow where you're providing the foundation and then refining the output. When you say you edit it to sound more like "your style" - what are you typically changing to make it feel more authentically you?

User: For one specific example, I've noticed that AI generated product descriptions REALLY like the word 'whimsy,' which isn't something I use in everyday speech. I'll usually take any appearance of 'whimsy' and its variations, and I substitute another, more specific descriptor. AI descriptions also tend to have very hollow, falsely-enthusiastic-sounding concluding sentences, so I almost always remove or rewrite those.

AI: That's a fascinating observation about AI's linguistic tendencies. The "whimsy" example is so specific - it really highlights how AI can have these patterns that don't match natural speech.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I spend a lot of time looking up patterns to use to make my product. I will always do this myself, because there has been a huge influx of AI-created "patterns" that are either impossible to recreate or result in a product that is a jumbled mess rather than the object it was meant to model.

AI: That's a really compelling example of where human judgment is irreplaceable. It sounds like pattern selection requires an understanding of both technical feasibility and quality that AI-generated content often lacks.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate through it. I don't know that I've ever used it to complete a task independently, because I know AI tools often make mistakes. A typical interaction pattern involves me inputting product data and asking for a more creative descriptive output, then tweaking the result to account for data mistakes (or erroneous additions) and personalizing the 'voice' of the description.

AI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense, especially given your awareness of AI's limitations. You mentioned tweaking for "data mistakes" and "erroneous additions" - can you give me an example of the kinds of errors you typically catch in those product descriptions?

User: One thing I've seen happen more than once is when I include a material type for the product  description. The AI response will often add its own detail for flavor which doesn't necessarily match the material type I listed. For example, I might say that a product includes alpaca yarn and would need to be hand washed, and the AI description might add that it could be hand washed in hot water, which would be incorrect.

AI: That's such a specific example of how AI can undermine accuracy by trying to be helpful. It adds contextual details that sound plausible but are actually wrong for your specific materials.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Because of the huge amount of AI generated patterns and fake images similar to my type of product, there is a deep skepticism and frustration regarding the confusion this causes. Myself and many other artists will often receive requests for products to be made matching an AI generated image, which can't actually be replicated the way the image shows it.  Because of these negative connotations, there's a sense of derision against the use of AI in creative spaces like mine. It has encouraged me to make sure I keep a heavy hand of my own influence and corrections in things I use AI to generate.

AI: That gives me a really clear picture of the tension in your creative community. The frustration with AI-generated patterns creating unrealistic customer expectations seems to create pressure to distance yourself from AI use entirely.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. In contrast, I was particularly satisfied when creating a batch of product descriptions for different items all at once. Because I did each one right after the other, the AI kept the formatting and general framework of each description uniform, making what I felt was a satisfying connection that ran between each page of my online listings.

AI: That's a great example of AI's strengths - creating consistency and cohesion across multiple pieces. It sounds like the uniformity actually enhanced your brand presentation in a way that would have been harder to achieve manually.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do have concerns that it will become too easy to rely on AI-created descriptions when it comes to things of a creative nature. As AI models learn and grow, by nature it will become more difficult to determine when something has been created by a human mind or by AI. I worry that this will take the nuance and diversity out of artistic works as people become less practiced in innovating their own art, which is why I try to limit my use of AI by keeping it a tool to hone my own brainstorming or to create a framework for me to build on.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on maintaining creative authenticity. You've described a really intentional approach - using AI as a starting point rather than an endpoint.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: My hope is that it will continue to be trained to work mathematics and numbers, so I could trust it to be able to take over more tedious tasks like calculating taxes and expense reports. I expect it will continue to be a presence in the artistic world as well, though I would envision myself using it more to organize and maintain my own thoughts rather than as a source to create ideas altogether on its own.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the broader creative community's experience with AI-generated patterns has shaped your own careful approach to using AI tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all for now!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with creative authenticity, and how community dynamics influence AI adoption, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the benefits and the challenges you've encountered. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
