Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Ok that sounds great to me!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So for a typical workday I will use AI for identification of different plants, shrubs, tress, pests, etc. I will also use it for creative help, for example, its opinion on landscaping projects, and how it things somehing should be laid out.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you work in landscaping or a related field. Tell me more about how you use AI for plant and pest identification. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: So for example, if I come to a point where I find a weed I don't know the name of, I'll ask ChatGPT. I'll message it with a picture of the weed. I often also use live camera view to see hear its thoughts. This will then lead to if I need to remove the weed or not. I live in a place where they don't like invasive plants, so removing things that are invasive are advised.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you get that identification from ChatGPT and learn whether something is invasive, what happens next in your workflow? Do you typically act on that information right away, or does it influence your decision-making in other ways?

User: I often do fact check the model, to make sure it is correct. I do this by typing the name of the species into Google and seeing if they match visually.

AI: That's a smart verification step. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle creative tasks myself for sure, like landscaping projects... but I enjoy hearing the AI's opinion on my idea, or see if it has any other ideas.

AI: Interesting - so you keep the creative control but value the AI as a sounding board. When you do ask for the AI's opinion on your landscaping ideas or seek its suggestions, could you describe how that conversation typically unfolds? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth, or do you present your concept and get feedback?

User: Usually, it'll be the latter, I'll ask it's opinion and hear what it has to say. I have tried live view when on site, to see what the AI thinks in real time, but I don't find the AI is as good in that area yet. It's often only a couple of conversation turns at max.

AI: That makes sense about the live view limitations. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your field using AI tools as well, or are you more of an early adopter?

User: I work alone most of the time, so I don't have anyone around to judge my use of AI. I have heard of friends in my industry using it for identification purposes, but the creative thinking is something I started doing myself.

AI: That's really interesting that you pioneered the creative consultation aspect on your own. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfaction often comes with identification purposes, the model is often correct in these instances. As for frustration, It's typically with live view, when I'm asking the AI something in real time, showing them what I'm seeing. This is almost always when I want creative help.

AI: That distinction is really clear - identification works well but creative help through live view falls short. When the live view disappoints you for creative input, what specifically goes wrong? Is it that the AI misunderstands what it's seeing, or gives suggestions that don't make sense for the space?

User: I think it's 50/50, often certain projects are overwhelmed with shrubs and other plants, so I imagine it's a busy scene to understand for the model. Sometimes the creative suggestions just don't match my thinking, which is ok.

AI: That visual complexity challenge makes a lot of sense. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Because my work requires a hands-on approach, I can't image AI taking over a lot of my work in the near future. However, it could certainly be a companion.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it becoming more integrated into your process, or do you think it'll stay in that companion role you mentioned?

User: I will continue to use it the way I've explained in this interview. I like to see it's progress as it gets better, so I won't stop using it as a companion.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a creative companion while maintaining control over the actual design work, and how you've developed that smart verification process for plant identification.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to learn how you've found that sweet spot of using AI as a knowledgeable companion while keeping the creative and hands-on aspects of your landscaping work firmly in your own hands.

Have a great rest of your day!
