Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good and no questions,; let's do it!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to create outlines for large articles as well as get directed to new sources I may not be able to find myself without spending hours of reading through research documents. I also use AI to make tonal suggestions in my writing or for suggestions on ways to adjust syntax to match specific audiences.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across several different stages of your writing process. 

When you mention using AI to get directed to new sources, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does that interaction typically unfold?

User: Sure. Let's say I am writing an article about what to expect during a Csection and I am answering questions from our viewers. One question is asking about a rumor they heard that doctors wipe the mothers anus and put it on the baby to give them exposure to germs they need to build their immune system. Now, I know they are misunderstanding studies regarding vaginal seeding and I could write about that, but I would like to be able to direct them towards studies or official statistics on where vaginal seeding is used and how the research developed. So I ask AI if it can find me websites that discuss scholarly articles or official research documents about vaginal seeding. AI is good at finding articles and I can then search through the articles linked sources for more official documents. AI isn't great at finding scholarly articles on its own yet unless they have been published in large journals or in books.

AI: That's a really detailed example - thank you. It sounds like you've developed a specific strategy where you use AI as a starting point to find articles, then trace back through their sources to get to the more authoritative research yourself.

Tell me more about that process of deciding what to trust from AI versus what you need to verify independently. How do you make those judgments?

User: I don't trust anything at face value from AI and ALWAYS verify independently. It would be irresponsible to take anything at face value from AI.

AI: That's a clear approach. Given that you always verify everything independently, what makes AI valuable enough in your workflow that you still choose to use it as that starting point?

User: Well, AI is really great at finding articles that mention my talking points, even if they aren't the main subject or in the title of the article. I have found that this means it finds more options for me than I find myself and can cut my independent research time down by about 30%.

AI: That's a significant time savings - 30% is substantial. So it sounds like AI is particularly good at identifying relevant content that might not surface in your own searches.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes. AI could potentially write my article in its entirety and then I could go add in sources myself, but I prefer to do all the writing myself. One, because it is the appropriate thing to do, but also because I enjoy the writing process and don't want to lose out on the experience.

AI: That's really thoughtful - you're making a distinction between what's appropriate and what you personally value about the work itself.

When you say you enjoy the writing process and don't want to lose out on that experience, can you tell me more about what specifically you find rewarding about doing the writing yourself?

User: Sure. I enjoy finding clever ways to express opinions. I enjoy the process of creating a flow of writing that keeps people reading. I love when readers tell me my articles are useful, and I would feel like a fraud if I didn't write it myself. I get an endorphin rush from seeing a completed article and reading it back to myself and remembering that none of these words or sentences existed 2 hours ago. It is hard to describe. I just like to express my thoughts in a way that is clear and useful and I like seeing other people read those thoughts and get something out of it.

AI: That's beautifully articulated - there's something deeply personal about that creative process and the connection you feel with your readers through your own words.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I like to collaborate throughout the task and I tend to  talk to the AI like it is a real person. Like it is my assistant. I think, how would I talk to a real person? I don't know why, I just think it works better that way.

AI: That's an interesting approach - treating it like a real conversation with an assistant. 

Can you give me an example of what that back-and-forth collaboration looks like? Maybe walk me through a specific interaction you had recently where you were working together on something?

User: Sure. I recently had  AI help me create an outline for an article about the economical benefits of online study materials and ebooks.  I gave the model the title and some of the main ideas I want to cover. It returned an outline. I thanked it and then mentioned that I thought a couple of the outline points were too similar. So we came up with which headlines could be combined. After that was done, I asked if it thought there was an appropriate place to discuss the moral vs economical argument of pirating books and would that fit into the scope of the style of the clients website. I linked them some other articles from the website. We decided together to instead fill the space with a section discussing the price increase of ebooks vs the actual cost of creating  an ebook and the moral failings of the increase in prices for students supplies as they become cheaper to create.

AI: That's a great example of real collaboration - you're bouncing ideas back and forth, making decisions together, even bringing in considerations about the client's website style. It really does sound like you're treating the AI as a thought partner.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: It hasn't really. I mean, I guess I have some clients that ask for no AI collaboration at all and I respect that and don't use it for them. However, I am my own boss so outside of that, there is no real influence on me.

AI: That's interesting - you have complete autonomy except when clients specifically request no AI use. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have felt frustrated with AI before when it comes to giving specific constraints it can't follow. For instance, telling it that I need to have 5 subsections and no subsection should have a title longer than 6 words and the model keeps returning really long title suggestions. Then I correct it and remind it of the constraints and it apologizes but continues to return results outside the parameters provided. At a certain point you just realize it is easier and faster to fix it yourself than to rely on the AI.

AI: That constraint-following issue sounds really frustrating, especially when you've been clear about specific requirements and it keeps missing them.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes. I have already seen a loss in contracts and work due to clients just using AI to create their content or scripts. Luckily, some of those clients have recently returned to me because their readers or viewers recognized that AI was being used because it has a very distinct writing style that people have started to recognize. Still, I am worried about my professional future as a writer.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - you're seeing both sides of it, where some clients are coming back because readers can tell the difference, but you're still feeling the overall pressure on your profession.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Maybe. I would like to be able to have an AI learn my specific style so I could let it handle things like, say I have written an article and a client comes back and asks "Can you add a section in the middle with (insert title here) as the title." If I could have AI use my writing style and provided research to create these sections seamlessly I could save time and take on more clients overall. But I worry about the model using other peoples writings or styles as reference and that feels straight up like plagiarism to me.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - having AI that could authentically match your specific style for those kinds of additions or modifications. The plagiarism concern you raise is really thoughtful too.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that creative satisfaction you get from the writing process itself, and your clear boundaries around verification and authenticity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think your questions were thorough.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI as a research assistant while maintaining your creative ownership, and your honest perspective on the challenges facing writers in this evolving landscape - it's all been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through those detailed examples. It gives us a much richer understanding of how these tools are actually being used day-to-day.

Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
