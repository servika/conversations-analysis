Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here as part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, let's begin

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for tasks for two different businesses that I have.  My music event production business I try to use it to help primarily with scheduling.  I have tried to schedule staff shifts and music acts.  In my custom art business I use it to brainstorm new ways of accomplishing things and to write copy for advertising.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across two quite different types of businesses. 

When you say you use it for scheduling staff shifts and music acts, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does the AI help you with that process?

User: I have tried to use it to work with an events full schedule.  I have shifts that need covered or slots for music.  Making these shedules takes lots of time.  I would like AI to speed it up and offer several functional options. I have asked for help filling out the work or music schedules.  I input the empty schedules and add the data to populate it with. I often have availability information for band or workers, and details like what area of work or what genre of music that I need to have taken into account.    Is this what you are asking for?

AI: Yes, that's exactly what I'm looking for - those specific details are really helpful.

Tell me more about how well that's actually working for you. When you give AI all that information - the empty schedules, availability, genres, work areas - what happens next? Does it give you those functional options you're hoping for?

User: Not easily.  It struggles with repeats alot.  For example, it will schedule a band twice because it meets a genre need.  I have gotten schedules that are about 75-80% functional.  I have benefitted from this, but it is far from easy to work with.  I have not yet tried to work with my spreadsheet form data, giving it more copy and paste type data.

AI: That's really valuable feedback - so you're getting some benefit but hitting those frustrating repetition issues. 

When you get those 75-80% functional schedules, what do you typically do next? Do you go back and forth with the AI to fix those problems, or do you just take what it gives you and manually clean it up yourself?

User: I have tried to point out the errors and keep going, my experience at this point is that the correction of one error leads often to a similar error like a second scheduling of a different band.  I have begun to just stop and work manually with the partial success.

AI: That sounds frustrating - like you're playing whack-a-mole with those scheduling conflicts. It makes sense you'd just take the partial success and finish manually.

Switching gears to your custom art business - you mentioned using AI to brainstorm new ways of accomplishing things and write advertising copy. How does that experience compare? Does it feel different working with AI on those creative tasks versus the scheduling?

User: Much better experience.  I am usually delighted and inspired to find new ideas or ways to accomplish something with the brainstorming.  I enjoy being able to have conversations and talk my way into the right solution path rather than the disjointed Google searches for similar bits.  The ad copy writing assistance has been a great help.  Especially once I decide upon a format and can get a batch of similar items quickly.

AI: That's such a striking contrast - from frustration with scheduling to feeling "delighted and inspired" with the creative work. 

You mentioned enjoying the conversational aspect of brainstorming versus "disjointed Google searches." Can you describe what that conversation with AI actually feels like when you're working through a creative problem? What makes it work so well for you?

User: I like that I can go from an intial query and refine it with multiple factors at once. Sometimes the refinement is perfect, sometimes i am questioned about what I mean, my custom creativity sometimes uses odd words as they come in fragments from my customers, other times I have my eyes opened to something I had not yet considered.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like the AI is almost like a creative partner that can handle your fragmented ideas and help you explore directions you hadn't thought of.

When you're in those moments where the AI questions what you mean or opens your eyes to something new, how do you typically respond? Do you find yourself adjusting your approach or does it send you down completely different creative paths?

User: I am generally trying to accomplish something customer defined.  Each order is a puzzle to be solved.  I am generally very open to new ways or ideas to accomplish something.  I enjoy how I can with a phrase go down a rabbit hole and right back out to the next hole.  Google search takes much more time to this step.

AI: I love that description - "with a phrase go down a rabbit hole and right back out to the next hole." That agility sounds like it really matches how you naturally work through creative problems.

Since you're using AI so differently across these two businesses - struggling with the scheduling but thriving with the creative work - are there certain tasks you've decided to keep for yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I keep correspondence solidly in my court.  Partially because the messages are across a variety of platforms.  I go from [REDACTED], to email, to text depending on the other person.  I also feel that keeping my correspondence solidly in my voice keeps me centric in my branding.  I also like to deal with those details so they are in my active memory, working with them is more functional for remembering than just reading over them.    I have not used AI for shopping for my supplies in the custom creation biz.  This is honestly my most time-consuming step, but I have yet to try AI in the assistance of it.  At the core I am building "fabrics" to turn into products and there are so many sensory bits to this that I dont know how to address properly to begin to try.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping correspondence in your own voice for branding and having those details in your active memory. The shopping for supplies sounds like such a tactile, sensory process.

You mentioned that supply shopping is your most time-consuming step but you haven't tried AI for it yet because of all those sensory elements. What are some of those sensory considerations that make it feel difficult to even know where to start with AI assistance?

User: Color words are nondefinitive.  Grape purple means different things to different people, each shop also has there own interpretation.   The finished fabric must behave properly, I dont know how to discuss the qualities of a fiber and how the process of incorporating it into the fabric in different ways makes such differences.   Quantities are also a difficultbit.  I often need to work swatches and change up methods, its kind of a drawn out process where coming back to a conversation later seems unnatural to me.

AI: That really paints the picture - the subjective nature of color language, the complex relationship between fiber qualities and how they'll behave in your process, and those iterative swatches where you're learning as you go.

You mentioned that coming back to a conversation later feels unnatural to you. When you think about your ideal workflow with supplies - if you could wave a magic wand - what would that look like? Would you want everything handled in one sitting, or is there something else about the timing that matters?

User: I tend to pop into things like the shopping.  I often spend time online to narrow it, play with what I have on hand, determine what qualities I need to be different, then perhaps try to go have a real touch experience with the items, then come back online later and try to find a bargain.  Timing doesnt really play in, the customers know they are getting art and that inspiration is not forced.

AI: That sounds like such an organic, intuitive process - bouncing between online research, hands-on experimentation, physical touch experiences, and then hunting for deals. It's clearly working for you creatively.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you run these businesses, I'm curious about whether other people in your industries are using AI, or if there are any expectations around it?

User: Im a woman delightfully working away from others for the most part.  In the art biz I am one on one with each customer creating an OOAK product never to be repeated. I have no point of comparison.  In the music event production, I feel I am utilizing the AI and other productivity tools more than those who are at my level, and feel that I am missing out on uses that larger more corporate office producers have mastered.

AI: That's really insightful - working independently in the art business where everything is one-of-a-kind, but feeling like you might be ahead of peers in music event production while simultaneously wondering what the bigger operations are doing.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I get frustrated more as more layers of details play into the process with the music event world. I really enjoy the discovery of  new angles or new items when creatively brainstorming for the art bits.  I love having such ease with ad copy.  This one is truly a time saver.

AI: Those are such clear examples of when AI clicks versus when it doesn't. The creative discovery and ad copy ease sound genuinely enjoyable, while those layered details in music scheduling create mounting frustration.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI will never make the magical dream come true fiber items that my art biz does, I am confident that my skills are master level and will never be at risk of not providing opportunities.  In the music event biz, I look forward to AI advancing with the detail and decision pieces to ease my load,  but know that the event fascilitation is such a large and hands on umbrella experience that I will only be able to better execute my position with its advancement.

AI: That confidence in your master-level fiber artistry really comes through - it sounds like AI enhances your process rather than threatening it. And you see AI as potentially making you better at event facilitation rather than replacing those skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you hope things go from here?

User: Ultimately, I am a process gal and if I could have a AI partner/program that could streamline my process and lead me gently into the next step or phase I feel that much of my stress would be reduced.

AI: That's such a beautiful way to put it - having an AI partner that could streamline your processes and gently guide you to the next step. That sounds like it would really match your natural working style.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how different it feels when AI matches your natural creative flow versus when it struggles with those complex scheduling layers.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I am good.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the difference between creative collaboration and complex scheduling challenges, along with your vision of AI as a gentle process partner, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through those specific examples - it gives us such a clear picture of how AI is working in real business situations. Thanks again!
