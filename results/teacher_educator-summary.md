## Representative Insights

### How Teachers & Educators Use AI

1. "Our instructional coach brings up using AI here or there, but I am the teacher in the school who teaches everybody else how to use AI. Younger teachers are much more open to it."
   *— From conversation 00097.md*

2. "I don't think you could use AI very well as a teacher unless you have the expertise to notice when the AI makes a mistake. I find I sharpen my skills when I'm judging AI using those same skills. I treat AI like a teacher assistant in many ways."
   *— From conversation 00097.md*

3. "I hope I can use AI to create more attractive products in the future.  It's not great at that. I see a future where I continue to increase my work quality while decreasing my work time by using AI."
   *— From conversation 00097.md*

4. "As I said earlier I don't truly believe AI can take over teaching as there is far too much human interaction and relationship requirement for people to learn effectively.

I can see it's use as a tool in helping with planning and the administrative side of teaching that is a hassle but it can't truly ever take over.
I need to keep my skills with it to keep up with the younger generation who use it as a standard part of their work."
   *— From conversation 00099.md*

5. "There are certain objectives or standards that I have to teach by and certain structures that I have to follow (i.e. writing format) that AI could improve on, but due to some restrictions with curriculum I am unable to use it for that. But, yes, I think AI could do a great job helping with those things."
   *— From conversation 00112.md*

6. "I use it mostly for planning purposes. I like to use it as I am planning. I know my big ideas, so I use AI to help me break down the ideas into smaller chunks."
   *— From conversation 00112.md*

7. "I think some of my colleague's use AI for planning, but we really don't discuss it. I use it consistently, as it speeds up the process for me to get all of my planning done but there isn't a push to use them in school at all. Some have mentioned using AI to create their exit tickets when they are done with a lesson."
   *— From conversation 00112.md*

8. "I was satisfied with the results when I added the questions AI came up with in my plans, my dean was impressed at the amount of detail that went into them. When I used the questions in class, they were valid and fit well into the interactions with the students. I haven't come across any frustrations with it as of yet."
   *— From conversation 00112.md*

9. "I use it mostly for administrative tasks. I'm the head of a maths department at a virtual school, and a maths teacher, so I use it to summarise 1:1 lessons with students to give a short report for the parents. I also use it to come up with to do lists, and sometimes if I'm having trouble phrasing something in the correct way I will ask it to change the tone of something I've written. I also occasionally use AI to create lesson content, such as maths questions to use."
   *— From conversation 00123.md*

10. "We format our knowledge organisers in a specific way, and we have to use school branding - I think it would take too long to get an AI model to understand which branding to use when, and to format it how I would like it to look."
   *— From conversation 00123.md*

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "I think it's a great resource but my worry is it will cause teaching to merely be about content delivery and we will take the humanity, artistry and creativity out of teaching. We already have a generation of ipad kids and do we really want that to be our future of learning? I'm not keen to see a Wall-E-esque future of learning for our children."
   *— From conversation 00099.md*

2. "It does connect somewhat to to concerns I have about my students using AI—I would feel like a bit of a hypocrite if I used AI extensively. I also just feel like I trust myself better than any AI platform. I'm sure some of what a model could produce might be helpful, but I've been teaching a while and I think I'm good at what I do. So I'd rather think of AI as an absolute last resort."
   *— From conversation 00136.md*

3. "That's a good question and one I honestly haven't given much thought to. I do my best to keep abreast of what AI is capable of but I'm not concerned about AI taking over anything that pertains to my work…at least, not yet. I think so much of what I do necessitates human interaction and feedback."
   *— From conversation 00136.md*

4. "I don't think AI will take over classroom teaching, so I don't really worry about that.  However, I have definitely considered how helpful AI can be for teachers.  This could be for creating station ideas like discussed above, creating slide decks or presentations to explain a topic,  writing worksheets that are specific to what you teach, or even simple tasks like creating groups and playing jeopardy games.  There are so many ways AI can help take some of the load off of teachers, because right now the teacher workload is pretty heavy."
   *— From conversation 00147.md*

5. "I imagine that as the cross-language usage becomes less risky, I'll probably have more use for it in things like creating flashcards or mind-maps that include both English and whatever first language my students at that time have, but probably my attitude towards just generating base materials and then working on them myself will stay the same. Maybe I'll use it more if I ever pay off my debts and then buy a premium subscription finally."
   *— From conversation 00183.md*

6. "It's not something I concern myself with too much. Evolving is part of education, and new resources are always being introduced that change the landscape of teaching. What remains the same is that students, who are tiny humans learning to be less tiny humans, continue to need to the guidance of people in the real world with whom they can build trusting relationships built on mutual respect and educational goals. AI will not change that aspect of education."
   *— From conversation 00189.md*

7. "If a passage is challenging and the student can't play it well after repeated practise of the actual music, it implies that the student my lack certain skills that need to be aquired before playing that passage. The ai can a) explain the challenge with that passage b) what skills one requires and c) what kind of drills one can use to aquire those skills"
   *— From conversation 00258.md*

8. "In the case described above, sometimes its analysis of the challenge is more useful to me than the actual drill suggestion that it provides. So I'm really using it for brainstorming the challenge then come up with solutions myself."
   *— From conversation 00258.md*

## Future Perspectives

1. "It would have a comprehensive database of scientific literature available to it. Whilst I understand that the AI cannot be expected to be updated daily with this material, with a connection to PubMed it would certainly be possible to be able to accurately cite research from up to a year ago. I gave the students a broad period of ten years (and compared to other topics such as cancer, prion case studies are extremely rare) and still the AI was quoting inappropriate studies and giving incorrect dates for their publication/inaccurate lead scientists."
   *— From conversation 00037.md*

2. "I think the most important think to understand is the limitation of AI presently; although once these limitations are addressed, it would be important to engage science professionals (including students and teachers) to test whether the changes have been made sufficiently. It takes a lot of confidence, particularly in an area such as medicine, to say to students 'you can trust what this AI is saying' so it is likely that there will be considerable pushback until a model has proved itself flawless in this area!"
   *— From conversation 00037.md*

3. "I hope I can use AI to create more attractive products in the future.  It's not great at that. I see a future where I continue to increase my work quality while decreasing my work time by using AI."
   *— From conversation 00097.md*

4. "I think it will be a matter of experimenting with different programs and thoughts. I'd love to do more with images links to stories such as nook covers and artistic pieces. Also using it to help flesh out students ideas. Potentially teaching students to use it like when Scratch coding first came out and it became a big part of what we taught. A lot of supporting others while learning and experimenting and trying to keep ahead of the curb."
   *— From conversation 00099.md*

5. "I think it's a great resource but my worry is it will cause teaching to merely be about content delivery and we will take the humanity, artistry and creativity out of teaching. We already have a generation of ipad kids and do we really want that to be our future of learning? I'm not keen to see a Wall-E-esque future of learning for our children."
   *— From conversation 00099.md*

6. "It depends. There are many times where I may not have been clear in the structure I am looking for in the lesson, so I need to fine tune my expectations. There are other times where I can take exactly what the AI has come up with and work it into my lessons."
   *— From conversation 00112.md*

7. "My skills are based on individual need, I have a hard time seeing AI take over the true quality of a seasoned teacher. The emotions that students display cannot be read through a chat message. There are certain areas in my field that AI will be beneficial for but the human-to-human interaction is paramount to the career and an AI can't pick up on that."
   *— From conversation 00112.md*

8. "i mean, i think AI can help students clarify understanding and provide feedback, but i don't really feel that AI will be able to implement classroom teaching at the moment"
   *— From conversation 00135.md*
