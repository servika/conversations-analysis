Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for streamlining tasks. For example, once completing a piece of work, such as an inspection report, I may upload this to an AI model and ask if there are any errors or inconsistencies in my work.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a quality check after you've completed your work. Tell me more about that process with your inspection reports. What kinds of errors or inconsistencies does the AI typically catch that you might have missed?

User: Usually simple things like spelling mistakes or missed words. Sometimes something more useful such as 'You referred to this structure as a culvert in X part of the report and a bypass in X part of the report.' I would then use this advice to make my wording consistent to reduce confusion. This is particularly useful when working with clients that do not have a technical background. The AI may identify areas of a report that require a definition for someone without technical expertise.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having AI spot those consistency issues and flag technical language that might need explaining. It sounds like it's helping you communicate more clearly with your clients.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are some tasks that could definitely be improved by AI, such as uploading photos and asking the models to identify any issues with the structures etc. but this is usually not recommended, as the stakes are very high. If a structural defect were missed or if the AI identifies an issue that isn't actually something to worry about, this could cost the company lots of money. I personally have a lot of trust in AI as someone who used it alongside their studies and has a lot of experience using it, so would feel fine using it to help me with identifying issues etc. However, people who have been doing things in a certain way for their entire career and haven't put the time in to learn about AI and how it can help them are unaware of its uses and therefore don't recommended it to others.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective on the tension between AI's potential and the high stakes of your work. You mention having trust in AI from using it during your studies and having extensive experience with it.

Can you walk me through how that experience shaped your confidence? What did you learn about AI's capabilities and limitations that makes you feel comfortable relying on it in ways your colleagues might not?

User: I think by using AI a lot over the past year, I have learned that it can be temperamental and sometimes make mistakes, though I have learnt ways of identifying mistakes. I have learned that when asking it math questions, for example, it is always best to break a difficult question up and ask for help on each step, rather than just one big, multiple part question. I also often choose to use multiple models and compare answers, as this increases the reliability. However, someone who has never used AI would not know to do these things, so takes the face-value of one model not being able to do something as 'all AI is unreliable'.

AI: That's a great example of how experience builds practical wisdom about working with AI - learning to break down complex problems, cross-check with multiple models, and recognize when mistakes might happen.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I use it more for collaboration.

AI: Tell me more about what that collaboration looks like in practice. Can you walk me through a specific example of how you and AI work together on a task from start to finish?

User: As I'm working on a task I regularly check for mistakes or help with smaller sections. For example, the inspection of a large structure if often broken up into different segments (eg. the deck, structural elements, foundations), I may ask for help identifying the types of failures in a section, or for help with terminology. Being early in my career, it is nice to not have to ask someone all the time for help, and being able to ask AI first before taking a colleague away from their own work.

AI: That's really thoughtful - using AI as a first resource so you're not constantly interrupting colleagues. It sounds like AI is serving almost like a mentor or reference guide as you're building your expertise.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned earlier that some colleagues are more hesitant about it.

User: I think with people around me being hesitant to use it I feel like it is frowned upon, as if someone using AI doesn't know how to do their own job. I try not to let this interfere with the way I use it, however.

AI: That sounds like a challenging dynamic to navigate - feeling like AI use might be perceived as incompetence when you see it as a valuable tool. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think it makes me feel satisfied when I am able to complete work faster when using AI. For example, making a deadline a few days early because I was able to streamline a few steps, or when a manager is impressed about the quality of work after I had used AI to check for mistakes or inconsistencies.

AI: It sounds like those moments when AI helps you exceed expectations are really rewarding. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider this, but I think I am in a lucky position where I can grow and develop as an engineer alongside AI, and adapt the way I work as AI becomes more advanced.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - growing alongside AI rather than feeling like you're competing with it. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as you continue developing in your career?

User: I think I will learn new ways of using it to my benefit, and I can hopefully become an expert in using AI for tasks that others do not know how to use it for.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how building experience with AI has taught you practical strategies like breaking down complex questions and cross-referencing multiple models - and how that sets you apart from colleagues who might dismiss AI based on limited exposure.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thats all.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating workplace culture around AI use, learning to collaborate effectively with AI tools, and positioning yourself to grow alongside these technologies will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
