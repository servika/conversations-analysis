Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's begin

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI assisted coding to create data parsers in python to help automate the analysis of large spreadsheets and pdf files.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application. When you're creating these data parsers with AI assistance, what does that process typically look like for you? Are you writing the code together with the AI, or do you usually give it specifications and have it generate the parser for you?

User: I usually give it specifications. i.e. Search this pdf file for all email addresses and display them. Ignore any email addresses with my company's domain.

AI: That's a clear example of task delegation. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The tasks I have to handle myself are unsupported or undocumented data structures. i.e. searching a SQLite database from a new app for relevant information. Without knowledge of the database structure, I cannot specify which fields should be extracted by  the AI generated tool.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you need that domain knowledge and exploration first. So it sounds like you handle the detective work of understanding new data structures yourself, then delegate the parser creation once you know what you're looking for.

When you do use AI for the supported tasks, can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like? Once you give those specifications, do you usually get what you need right away, or is there back-and-forth refinement?

User: There is usually some back and forth refinement. In essence, I am recreating GREP in Windows with these instructions in python, but depending on how the model structures the query, it can sometimes miss data that it doesn't account for. i.e. I as the model to create a function that searches for phone numbers in a pdf. It searches for phone numbers structured like this ###-###-####, but does not account for phone numbers that aren't separated by "-" or international numbers that have a different amount of numbers.

AI: That's a really concrete example of where the collaboration aspect comes in. So you're essentially debugging and refining the AI's approach when it makes assumptions about data formats.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using similar approaches, or are you more of an early adopter in your environment?

User: I am an early adopter, specifically of AI reliance on coding. My coworkers typically use the information I synthesize from the larger dataset. My job is to refine the data for easier processing.

AI: So you're kind of the bridge between the raw data and your team - using AI to help you process and clean it up for others to work with. That's an interesting position to be in as the early adopter.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently created a GUI app that searches csv and pdf files recursively for email addresses and IP addresses. While there were some frustrations, particularly related to synthesizing the IP data correctly, I had the forethought to include file paths as part of the results, allowing users to find the original CSV or pdf quickly. This saves a lot of time if the user has to find additional information from the original document. It leads them straight to it.

AI: That's a great example of thinking ahead about the user experience. It sounds like even when the AI didn't get the IP data synthesis perfect initially, you were able to design around potential limitations by including those file paths.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's essential for testing and validation purposes. In my line of work AI is being implemented rapidly without many checks and balances

AI: That's a really important perspective - maintaining those skills as a quality control mechanism. It sounds like you see your expertise as crucial for catching when AI gets things wrong, especially in an environment where it's being adopted quickly.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself continuing in this role of directing and validating AI tools, or do you think it might change?

User: i think it may evolve in streamlining and automating tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being an early adopter who serves as both a bridge for your team and a quality control mechanism in an environment with rapid AI adoption.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for data parsing, the importance of maintaining technical skills for validation, and your role as an early adopter will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
