Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI every day. Typically for very simple tasks such as revising or writing emails. I email with a lot of "higher up" people in my company such as my CEO and VP of Finance so I like AI to revise my emails to them. Or, sometimes I will give AI a few main bullets and ask it to write it in email format

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like AI serves as your communication assistant for important correspondence. 

Can you walk me through what that revision process typically looks like? When you ask AI to revise an email to your CEO, what specifically are you looking for it to improve or change?

User: The revision process usually entails me sending a draft email to AI, and asking it to revise it. I will usually add "revise this message to my CEO" or "make this more concise" to give it more context or a specific tone I want. If I am just emailing my coworkers that I speak with every day I will say something like "Revise this, keep it casual". I am usually looking to improve my language and the flow of conversation.

AI: That's a really clear process - it sounds like you're quite strategic about tailoring the tone based on your audience and relationship with them.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I think there are a lot of tasks I do that I'm not sure if AI could help me with. Typically involving Excel spreadsheets or data from other platforms that I don't know if AI could help with, so I just do it myself. I am in HR so I also deal with a lot of sensitive or personally identifiable information for our employees so I do not want that info in the AI system

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the sensitivity around employee data is a really important consideration in HR work.

When you mention Excel spreadsheets and data from other platforms, what kinds of tasks are you typically doing with those? I'm curious what those workflows look like that you're not sure AI could assist with.

User: I am typically pulling and cleaning reports to send to my team. For example, every week I pull a report of all active providers from Paycom (our HR system). I then have  to compare that report to a different Excel spreadsheet that lists if any of those providers are still going through the onboarding process. I have  to highlight the providers still going through onboarding on the Active Providers report, so that they don't count as an active provider quite yet until they complete onboarding. Just a bunch of random reports like that where I am cleaning up data and sending them to team members

AI: That sounds like quite a bit of manual data cross-referencing and cleanup work each week. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate with it throughout a task. For example, I will send it an email to revise, and then if I want it to tweak a certain word or sentence phrasing, I'll reply and collaborate with AI until I get the email to sound how I want.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds really interactive. It's interesting how you're essentially having a conversation with AI to fine-tune the output.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I would say my company is pretty behind when it comes to adopting AI. I have  actually pushed us using AI more in the workplace, but since we deal with so much sensitive data it's hard to figure out how to use it productively. I think if my workplace was pushing it more, then I would use it for way more tasks.

AI: That's really interesting that you're actually the one advocating for more AI use despite the constraints. It sounds like you see potential beyond what you're currently able to implement.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time I felt satisfied is when I was asked to redo our onboarding "Welcome" email to new providers. It's quite a lot of paragraphs in this email, and I wanted it to be more concise and digestible for new providers. I was trying to think of ways to improve it on my own, but then I thought why don't I just run this through AI? So I did, and the very first output was perfect. It used bullet points, a couple meaningful emojis to spruce it up, and captured all necessary information. I really appreciated having a tool generate something like that so quickly

AI: That's a great example of AI really delivering exactly what you needed right away. It sounds like that experience showed you the potential for AI to handle more substantial content creation, not just email revisions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Can you clarify what you mean by that?

AI: Sure! I'm curious about whether you think about keeping your own writing or communication skills sharp, even as you use AI to help with emails and content creation. 

For instance, do you ever worry about becoming too dependent on AI for tasks like writing, or do you see it more as a tool that enhances what you can already do?

User: Oh 100%. I do worry that I rely on AI too much to write for me. I think I have  solid writing skills, but I think I could be more concise. I have  relied on AI lately to write for me. I am not sure exactly what it would look like for me to hone in on that skill - taking a writing class maybe. In reality, I probably wouldn't do that

AI: That's a really honest reflection. It sounds like you're aware of that balance between leveraging AI's strengths and maintaining your own abilities, even if actively working on it feels like a challenge in practice.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I could see myself using AI for tasks beyond email writing/revisions. Myself or my company would have  to figure out ways to mask sensitive information, and if that's the case then I'm not sure how effective AI would be since it couldn't actually analyze employee info. But, I could see myself trying to use AI for more research based projects such as different HR regulations, as well as generating ideas for HR projects such as HR events (prize wheels, ice breakers, etc.).

AI: That's a thoughtful way to think about expanding your AI use - focusing on areas where you don't need to share sensitive data but can still get real value from AI's capabilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the advocate for AI adoption in a company that's still cautious about it, and how you've found that sweet spot with email communication while being mindful of data sensitivity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope that's all. thanks~

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in a sensitive data environment, being an internal advocate for adoption, and that collaborative approach to refining content will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
