Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions yet

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Recently I worked on a research project to determine whether or not different machine learning models could accurately predict the outcome of specific batter vs. hitter matchups in a baseball game. The first steps were to extract and clean the data, the following step was to build different types of models (SVM, LightGBM and CNN) that could potentially be a good fit for the output we want, tailor the dataset input to each type of model studied, and finally use statistical methods to determine which model provided the most accurate models.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project combining sports analytics with machine learning! I can picture that workflow - from data extraction and cleaning, through model building and tailoring, to statistical evaluation.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We used AI to help clean data and also to build a basic skeleton of each model as a guiding hand.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for the data cleaning - what did that look like in practice?

User: We inputted a lot of raw statistics for each player into the model and asked it to combine certain stats to output another statistic criteria we wanted to use. We also used it to remove players that didn't fit the criteria we were looking for, i.e. players who were rookies or over a certain age.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI helped you both derive new statistical measures from existing data and filter your dataset based on specific criteria. 

For those tasks - the data cleaning and creating that basic model skeleton - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach.

User: We used AI because we believed it to be a great starting point for code we were writing. It allows you to see an overview of all potentially required sections quicker, thus allowing you to see what is missing or needs improvement. Traditional approaches also work but would have been longer to iterate through many ideas.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a way to quickly iterate and see the bigger picture before diving into the details. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like maybe the statistical evaluation phase or other aspects - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: We found that AI was not able to draw the same in depth conclusions about the picture the statistics painted. It needed to be used in conjunction with a researcher.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - that AI couldn't capture the deeper analytical insights that a human researcher brings to interpreting the statistical results.

When you did use AI for the data cleaning and model skeleton, how did you verify or validate what it produced?

User: We would spot check the cleaned data to ensure it was not jargon. For the skeleton we used it as baseline, it needed adjustments to tailor it to what we needed.

AI: Got it - so you took a verification approach with spot-checking for the data work, and treated the model code more as a starting template that required your expertise to customize.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Here's my last question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: The critical analysis of the data and assistance in drawing proper conclusions based on stats. Currently it is not reliable enough to provide actual insights we can use.

AI: That's really valuable insight - you're pointing to what sounds like the most intellectually demanding part of the research process, where you need that deep analytical thinking to interpret what the statistics actually mean in context.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a starting point for iteration while recognizing its limitations in critical analysis were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI being most valuable as a rapid iteration tool for getting started, while still requiring human expertise for the critical analytical work, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific research. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I really appreciate your time today!
