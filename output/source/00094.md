Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to research data regarding travelers and meetings for destinations. I look for statistics regarding reasons that travelers go to different destinations and what they like to do while they are there. I also like to use AI to find data regarding traveler volume over different periods of time. In addition, I do research to look for patterns regarding how meeting planners make decisions when choosing where to hold their meetings. This is done through reviewing RFP's for past meetings along with reportable data that's available online.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're doing quite a bit of market research and analysis in the travel and meetings industry. 

Tell me more about how you actually go about using AI for this research. When you're looking for those traveler statistics or analyzing RFP patterns, what does that process look like for you?

User: For travelers I will search for things like visitor history to Orlando such as what parks they visit, how long they stay, what types of hotels and their typical daily spending while on vacation. For meeting planners I am looking for details regarding past meeting histories such as total attendance, peak room night pick up, square footage needed for meeting space and total food and beverage spend.

AI: I can see you're gathering very specific metrics - visitor patterns, spending habits, room nights, meeting space requirements. 

When you're conducting these searches, how do you typically interact with AI to get this information? Do you find yourself going back and forth with follow-up questions, or do you usually get what you need in one comprehensive request?

User: I always need to ask follow up questions to refine the data or to format it specifically for output into a Google Sheet. For example, I might ask for the last five locations for the annual meeting for the American Medical Association and all available data regarding each of those meetings concerning attendance, room blocks, and other pertinent information. For a visitor scenario I would ask how many travelers visited a place like Greenville, SC for example and for any available data regarding their demographics and interests.

AI: That makes sense - so you're having ongoing conversations with AI to drill down and get the data formatted exactly how you need it.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in this research process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Right now I format the information in Google Sheets myself as I haven't been happy with the formatting options available with standard AI tools, particularly when it comes to design and formatting in a professional format.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're drawing a line at the formatting and design stage because the AI outputs don't meet your professional standards.

When you are using AI for the research and data gathering parts, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the entire research process, or do you tend to give it specific research tasks to handle independently while you move on to other things?

User: I typically assign it specific tasks. So if my client is Greenville, SC as an example, I would ask AI to give me data regarding associations or corporations that held their meetings in Greenville in 2022 and any available data regarding the size and needs of those groups. I may then have separate sessions where I ask about the individual organizations themselves like other meetings they hold.

AI: So you're breaking down your research into distinct tasks and handling them in separate sessions - one focused on meetings held in Greenville, another diving deeper into specific organizations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: I work independently so I developed my own approach.

AI: That gives you a lot of freedom to experiment and find what works best for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI was able to quickly gather details regarding all of the meetings held by the American Medical Association, including details regarding upcoming locations and RFP's for future events. I was very happy with that. I still struggle getting it to format information in a way that I intend, either I'm not presenting the details accurately enough or the formatting options for the models are limited.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like AI really excelled at the comprehensive data gathering for AMA's meeting history and future plans, but the formatting piece remains a challenge.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would love if AI could take over formatting, I've never been very good at it myself and presenting details in an infographic format for a client would be outstanding.

AI: That's a refreshing perspective - you're actually hoping AI will get better at something you find challenging rather than worrying about it replacing skills you value.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for your research process?

User: My hope is that AI will help me work more efficiently and accurately for my clients with the ability to aggregate large amounts of meeting and visitor data much more quickly than I can as a human. Also, for it to be able to design and present it in a variety of ways using tools like Slides and Sheets would be of tremendous value.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting AI to complement your skills rather than replace them - especially how you'd welcome it taking over the formatting challenges while you focus on the strategic research and client relationships.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's it! Thanks for the chat!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for travel and meetings industry research - from the specific data gathering processes to your hopes for better formatting capabilities - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
