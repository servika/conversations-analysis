Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for planning lessons and proofreading/improving correspondence.

AI: Tell me more about the lesson planning part. What does that process look like when you're working with AI?

User: I generally use it for brainstorming - coming up with lists of ideas on how I can teach a specific topic and tailor it to my pupils. I then use it collaboratively to come up with a single lesson plan or a series of lesson plans.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned using it collaboratively to develop the actual lesson plans. Can you walk me through what that collaboration looks like? How do you and the AI work together on that?

User: I build on the ideas that the AI initally comes up with for the lesson and we explore them together.

AI: What does that exploration look like in practice? Can you give me an example of how you might build on an AI's initial ideas for a lesson?

User: The children in my class have complex needs. For example, I could be teaching parachute games in gym. I might first ask for a list of parachute games and then maybe choose one of the games and ask the AI to break down step by step how I could teach my learners the game. I might ask how to incorporate elements of speech and language into the game. Or how to adapt it to include pupils with mobility issues. We might discuss which specific skills the children are learning from the game and then I might ask for other games or activities consolidating the same skill.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful way to adapt activities for your students' specific needs. When you're going through that process of building and adapting the lesson with AI, how do you decide what to keep from the AI's suggestions versus what you want to modify or handle differently yourself?

User: I know my pupils well so I reflect on the AI's suggestions and move forward with what would work for my particular pupils.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I haven't used AI to create resources yet because I don't know much about how to do that and feel I could still make what I am looking for faster myself. However, I would like to learn how to do this in the future as I feel it could save time once I've mastered it.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like there's a learning curve consideration there. Beyond resource creation, are there other aspects of your teaching work where you think "I want to keep doing this myself" even if AI could potentially help?

User: Things like writing targets for my pupils I would want to keep doing myself.

AI: What is it about writing targets for your pupils that makes you want to keep that task for yourself?

User: I know my pupils very well which is vital for writing the targets. Also, the targets need to be written in a very specific way using particular language which I think would take a lot of time to get right with AI. I am not sure about confidentiality issues also and GDPR

AI: Those are really thoughtful considerations. You mentioned confidentiality and GDPR concerns - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are there guidelines or discussions happening around AI use?

User: I am not aware of any guidelines yet. Education tends to be very far behind in the use of technology!

AI: That's an interesting observation about education being behind with technology. Given that context, how do your colleagues approach AI use - are you finding others are experimenting with it too, or are you more on your own in exploring these tools?

User: I have not discussed it with my colleagues to be honest. However I think that who is using it would probably depend on the age of the teacher.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The times I am most satisfied is when I'm really stuck for ideas and AI helps me to come up with something.

AI: Tell me more about those moments when you're really stuck. What does that situation typically look like, and how does the AI help pull you out of it?

User: It's sometimes hard to match the curriculum to the needs of my learners. Some of them are very clever but non-verbal and it can be hard to think of ways to help them to show their knowledge. AI helps by brainstorming ideas with me

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful way AI supports your work - helping you find ways for non-verbal students to demonstrate their knowledge. Have you had any frustrating experiences with AI, or times when it didn't work out as you hoped?

User: I can't think of a specific example right now but generally it would just be when I need something very specific and I am not able to get the AI to understand exactly what that is

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think AI could ever take over teaching.

AI: What is it about teaching that you feel makes it something AI couldn't take over?

User: There's such a personal element - the most important part of teaching is building relationships. Relationships with children, parents, colleagues and other agencies.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to use AI more to create actual resources e.g. worksheets

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you brainstorm ways for non-verbal students to demonstrate their knowledge - that really highlighted how you're using AI to support your deep understanding of your students' individual needs.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's everything!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative brainstorming partner while maintaining the essential human elements of teaching - especially those relationships and your deep knowledge of your students' individual needs - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
