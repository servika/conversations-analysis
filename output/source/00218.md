Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: i work as a qa engineer for a startup that does qa as a service. i frequently use ai for things like writing code comments, jsdocs, small utility functions, or conversationally when problem solving

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your development workflow. 

Tell me more about that conversational problem-solving aspect. What does that interaction typically look like for you?

User: when writing automated tests, there's often client-specific context that i don't have extensive knowledge of. it's sometimes helpful to quickly get an idea of what a client's application is supposed to do by asking ai, then to ask additional followup questions for more complex issues

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a way to quickly get up to speed on unfamiliar client domains. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: ai very rarely does a good job finding high quality locators for playwright tests, and also usually fails to follow existing code structure. anything more creative or requiring understanding of client context it also doesn't do a good job of. basically, anything that's relatively deterministic i'm comfortable using ai, otherwise i prefer to do it myself

AI: That's a really clear distinction you've drawn - deterministic tasks versus those requiring creativity or deeper context understanding. 

When you do use AI for those deterministic tasks like writing utility functions or code comments, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to delegate the complete task for it to handle independently?

User: in the example of writing playwright tests, i'll often write out all the test steps without comments, then ask for comments for each action in the test. it's usually not completely correct so i make small edits after that. there's nothing i would completely delegate, at least not without doing some editing or reviewing afterward

AI: So it sounds like you've developed a pretty collaborative workflow - you maintain control over the structure and logic, then bring AI in for specific pieces, followed by your own review and refinement.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: the company pushes their own ai pretty hard but i don't find it to be very good, and in any case i would still prefer to do things how i've described (mainly save it for determinstic/simple tasks). i feel that the company culture around ai is more about optics and appeasing investors than actual utility

AI: That's a really candid perspective about the disconnect between company AI messaging and practical utility. It sounds like you've developed your own approach based on what actually works for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: using ai for the aforementioned code comments or js docs can be a major time saver. it can be frustrating when it totally misunderstands or misses important context and inevitably wastes more time than it would have had i just done the task myself, although i tend to just avoid using it as much as possible for this reason. it can also be satisfying to quickly get context on a client that would've taken a lot of time to research

AI: It sounds like you've really calibrated your expectations - you get satisfaction from those clear time-savers but have learned to recognize when AI might actually slow you down.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: it seems clear to me that the use of ai is itself a skill and the degree to which it will take over is likely to be gradual. from my experience using available tools i'm pretty confident no serious knowledge-based work is at serious risk anytime soon

AI: That's a really thoughtful take - viewing AI use as a skill in itself rather than a replacement threat. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: i don't see it changing unless there's some major paradigm shift, like a new development in LLMs or a movement away from LLMs

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed this calibrated approach - using AI strategically for deterministic tasks while maintaining clear boundaries based on what actually works in practice.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: that's all

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of integrating AI into QA work - especially that balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while recognizing its limitations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candid thoughts about both the useful applications and the workplace dynamics around AI adoption. Take care!
