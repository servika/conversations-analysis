Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to help me research, talk through ideas and also to clean up my writing before I send certain important emails/documents. I let it follow along with the conversation when the topics are nuanced and summarize the key points and keep a log for me, so I can see how things develop.

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI as both a research partner and a conversation tracker. 

Tell me more about that last part - having AI follow along with conversations and keep a log. What kinds of conversations are you referring to, and how does that help you in your work?

User: When we are working on new ideas or product development and lots of ideas are being tossed around all the time and changed constantly, AI is better at keeping up with the changes and organizing the conversation to moniter the progression and make sure we don't forget anything.

AI: That sounds like AI is playing a really valuable role in those dynamic brainstorming sessions. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I am hesitant to put important personal or confidential information into AI

AI: That makes sense - you're being selective about what information you share.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I haven't quite figured out how to use it to effectively delegate tasks but I use it for help along the way. I have a harder time with images and AI, so I might do something like ask it to generate a social media calendar, but I can't get it to generate the content to fully automate that task.

AI: It sounds like you're still finding the right balance between what works well and what's more challenging with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: No. I would say that my colleagues are curious about AI but intimidated by it. I use it the most.

AI: So you're kind of the early adopter in your workplace. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. When I am drafting follow up emails, I can upload my notes and AI generates a personalized follow up in seconds, saving me a ton of time.

AI: That sounds like a great time-saver! 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't work as a lawyer, but I am a lawyer and every time I use AI, I think that so much of that profession could be done more efficiently and with less error by AI. It doesn't make me concerned, but it makes me think about my kids and the fields that they should eventually go into.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - thinking about the future landscape for the next generation.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I have some surface knowledge that doesn't extended too far past chatGPT. I would like it to help me more, specifically with images and content generation, but I don't have the right tools to be succesful with that, at this time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the early adopter in your workplace and how you're thinking about AI's impact on future career paths for your kids.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so. I am impressed by AI and it's capabilites and know that I have so much more to learn about it!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a conversation tracker in product development sessions, being the early adopter in your workplace, and your thoughtful reflections on how AI might reshape professions like law will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
