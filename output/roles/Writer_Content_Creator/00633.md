Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use it for curriculum and learning.  Basically, when I'm creating learning materials and struggle to come up with ideas, or need some inspiration.

AI: That's interesting - so you work in education or training. When you say you use it for inspiration when creating learning materials, what does that process typically look like for you? Can you walk me through a specific example of how that might unfold?

User: Sure.  I'm typically a very creative person, but since education is always changing, I'm required to develop materials that can adapt to a lot of different learning styles, etc.  I have a lot of experience I can pull from, but since remote learning is really big now, I've had to adapt some things for remote learning instead of an in-person classroom.  So, when I'm trying to create learning games, for example, I may be limited to using a specific program that I can share online (like Powerpoint, etc.) that requires student interaction.  I don't always have a lot of ideas when it comes to remote interaction and games that can be shared in something like Teams or Zoom.  Typically, when I've used AI in the past, I've looked into having a conversation to help inspire ideas for me.  I don't like "normal" quiz games where you ask questions and quiz students for answers.  That gets repetitive and boring quickly.  With AI conversations, I'll chat with it about unique ideas that can still get the learning done, but also being unique in the process, like taking a real-life game and making it adaptable to remote learning.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - adapting from in-person to remote learning while keeping things engaging sounds like a real challenge. 

Tell me more about those conversations you have with AI when you're brainstorming. How do you typically start those conversations, and what does the back-and-forth look like as you're working through ideas together?

User: I'll be honest- the conversations usually aren't too long because I get inspired quickly.  I'll usually start off a conversation like, "Here's my classroom situation.  I have X amount of students, we're using this online platform to learn, and I need an activity that's going to teach Y and get them engaged despite us being online.  I need to use A, B, or C platforms to create the game, but I want something unique.  I don't want a typical quiz game or assessment.  I want the game to be fun and engaging that can get everyone involved."  The AI will usually respond with about 3-5 ideas, but typically the ideas are generic and are the typical quiz games I say to not suggest.  I'll usually do a follow-up question like, "Okay, let's look at game #2.  I like the concept of it and it does get people involved, but it's a typical question and answer.  How can we change this up to be more fun or unique?"  In the process of this conversation, I'll usually get an idea that the conversation has inspired me with.  All in all, I typically don't use the suggestions the AI gives me, but I find the conversations themselves to inspire me to come up with my own ideas and get me thinking deeper and more creatively.

AI: That's really fascinating - so the AI isn't necessarily giving you the final solution, but the conversation itself is what sparks your own creativity. It sounds like you're using it almost as a thinking partner to help you work through your own ideas.

When you say the AI's initial suggestions are often too generic or typical, what happens in your mind during that back-and-forth? How does that process of pushing back on the suggestions help you arrive at your own ideas?

User: Exactly.  And it usually makes people scratch their heads because they're like, wait - that's not how that's supposed to work (ha!)  I'm ashamed to admit that I don't tend to do well with groups and I work better solo (though I work in groups because I kinda have to, ha.)  But I am a social person and learn a lot from conversation.  I just don't usually get to have these conversations with others because (no offense to my co-workers), but they're typically not fond of having to do this type of creative thinking.  
I think the back and forth forces me to think outside of the box.  It's easy to be told what to do or how to do it, and I think a lot of people sort of want that because it gives them more time to focus on things they want to focus on.  I think it's more of a personality thing perhaps?  I love thinking of creative solutions and having conversations that asks questions to make me think deeper.  I don't get that in the real life conversations I have because people don't care about that.  They care more about getting things done quick and fast whereas I want something that's going to have more of an impact.  Of course, this isn't a one-size fits all thing as some of my co-workers are creative and they think like I do.  But you get the idea.

AI: That really resonates - it sounds like AI is filling a conversational gap for you that's hard to find elsewhere. You mentioned that your coworkers often want to get things done quickly rather than dive into that deeper creative thinking.

How does this difference in approach affect how you navigate your workplace? Do you find yourself keeping your AI brainstorming sessions private, or have you shared this process with colleagues?

User: I do things more solo.  Of course, we collaborate and chat about what needs to be done and things like that.  But I really do better when I'm allowed to just be creative and run with it.  I'm super fortunate to have a supportive work environment and co-workers that allows for me to do this.  It's been like that at my other jobs as well where I've had to create things.  But I think having the success to back it up helps.

AI: That's wonderful that you have that supportive environment to work creatively. 

I'm curious about your relationship with maintaining your own creative skills. Since you're using AI as this thinking partner but ultimately coming up with your own solutions, how do you think about keeping your creative abilities sharp? Is this something you actively consider, or does it feel natural since you're still doing the heavy lifting creatively?

User: Absolutely.  I'll be honest, as much as I love AI, I'm concerned that people will use it as an excuse to become cognitively and creatively lazy because they think "I can just let the AI do it, so why bother?"  I also work a third job in creative writing and there's been a BIG conversation on AI with that.  So many authors now are letting AI write their books for them and it's led a lot of people to pushback on it.  But then, people get angry if you use AI as a conversation buddy because they think that's somehow cheating.  I don't see conversations to inspire creativity as a bad thing - it's no different than talking with a fellow writer friend or a beta reader in my eyes.  But when a writer throws out the pen and says, "AI is writing it for me", I don't think that person should call themselves a writer anymore, because the AI is the writer at that point.

AI: That's such a thoughtful distinction you're drawing - between using AI as a conversation partner versus having it do the creative work for you. It sounds like you've really thought through where those lines are for yourself.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't really say I've ever had it made me feel frustrated, but I've also never used AI in a way that I thought was going against my personal integrity.  I think there's lots of times where AI has made me satisfied, though.  Once, during a conversation about learning games, it inspired me to create an interactive game that incorporated real-world scenarios with what the students were learning and it was a huge hit.  In my writing job, I used it for research on monarchies, and in my conversation about arranged marriages with monarchies, it made me remember a huge plot hole in the novel I was working on that ended up changing the plot in a big way!

AI: Those are great examples - I love how in both cases the AI conversation led you to your own breakthrough moments. The plot hole discovery is particularly interesting since that came up organically during research.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself continuing with this conversational approach, or do you think it might change as the technology develops?

User: I want to keep the conversation going.  If it's not broke, why fix it?  Plus, I also want to respect the AI's contribution to society and not just use it to abuse it so to speak.  I want it to make society better, but not turn it into a technology that's going to make people lazy and dumb because they dump everything on the AI instead of doing it themselves.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a conversational thinking partner rather than a replacement for your own creativity, and how you've navigated the balance between leveraging AI's help while maintaining your own creative integrity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of.  I really appreciate you taking the time to hear my thoughts.  Thanks so much!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a thinking partner while maintaining creative ownership, and your thoughtful approach to where those boundaries should be, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been a pleasure talking with you - take care!
