Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, I'm ready to start.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI for written tasks, particularly email. When I need to save time, I use it to help me draft emails from scratch, or will enter in a partial message and have AI help me craft a cleaner version of my message. In my field, I communicate with a lot of colleagues and stakeholders within and beyond the organization so tone is very important. I like to use AI to help me ensure the tone of the message is right for the audience and for the point I'm trying to make. I also use AI as a creative tool to help me come up with ideas for engaging program and events that I might be able to organize.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned that tone is particularly important given your stakeholder communications. 

Can you walk me through what that process looks like when you're using AI to get the tone right? How do you typically interact with the AI to achieve the result you're looking for?

User: If I'm asking AI to help me generate an email message from scratch, I like to give it as much context as possible (explaining the background of the situation, who I'm in contact with, and the goal of the communication). For example I might say something like "I need to send a message to a student who missed the deadline for an award. I want to make sure the message makes it clear that there isn't flexibility with the deadline, but is still written in a way that's supportive of them applying for future opportunities through our office." In other situations where I've drafted an email on my own, I might copy and paste it into AI to ensure the tone is firm while still being professional. For example, this week, I asked AI to review an email that I drafted to ensure it wasn't curt or petty, as I just wanted to be direct. A lot can be misconstrued over written communication and I want to make sure my intentions are as clear as possible, and AI helps me do that.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach to using AI for communication. You're giving it quite detailed context and being very specific about the tone you're aiming for.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, there are certain tasks that I prefer to handle myself. My work requires me to write strong recommendation letters (oftentimes on behalf of a university administrator who will ultimately sign the letter) to include alongside a student's competitive award application package. While I could feed AI anonymized information about the student's qualifications and application to draft a letter, I don't feel that's appropriate. For a reference of that magnitude, I prefer that it be written by me given that I've had continual direct one on one contact with the student and have built a rapport with them. In these instances I do use AI as a thesaurus, and it's very helpful because I can give it a little more context about the point I'm trying to convey to help me come up with an alternative word, which has been much more helpful than my previous practice of Googling "what's another word for X". Also, in my role, I give a significant amount of written feedback on student applications and I don't feel that it would be appropriate to use AI to help generate feedback given my extensive knowledge and experience with these awards and because of my understanding of the student behind the application.

AI: That distinction you're making is really interesting - it sounds like there's something about the personal relationship and your direct knowledge that makes those tasks feel like they should stay with you.

When you do use AI for work tasks like email drafting or brainstorming events, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: For work like email drafting, I will mostly delegate complete tasks for AI to handle fully and independently whether that's reviewing and polishing a completed email draft, or trusting it to draft a message based on the context and parameters I provide. For these tasks, I already have an idea of the end result, so I don't do too much collaborating in these cases. On the other hand, when I'm brainstorming ideas for a program or event, I tend to collaborate with AI more, having back and forth conversation about ideas, and working with AI to tweak them until I feel they're right. I also might come back to the conversation at different stages of event planning. For instance, this summer I asked AI for help with organizing my thoughts on how to present information for a conference session and well after I settled on the information I wanted to share, I came back to the conversation to get ideas on how to put together an informative one-pager to share with attendees.

AI: That's a great example of how you adapt your interaction style based on the type of work. It sounds like for more defined tasks like emails you can be quite direct, but for creative work you're having more of an ongoing conversation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Working in an educational institution, I think there is a lot of mixed feelings when it comes to AI, especially depending on who is using it and for what. AI is still a pretty taboo topic, especially when it comes to student use. There are many instructors who view the use of AI as cheating while others encourage its use. I personally think it comes down to how AI is being used by students. If it's being used to complete full assignments, then I understand why it might be considered cheating, but if students are using AI as a research tool, as a thesaurus, to help them organize their thoughts, etc., I don't think that's bad. While AI use is generally more accepted among professional staff members, it is still taboo, especially when it comes to privacy concerns. In my use of AI, I make sure to remove any personal identifying information from my messages to avoid FERPA issues. While I know some of my colleagues use AI to help them write emails, organize data, and help them understand and navigate complex information, the use of AI isn't something widely discussed (or embraced) though it's not discouraged.

AI: That's a really nuanced view of the cultural dynamics around AI in education. It sounds like you've had to navigate some of that complexity yourself, especially around privacy considerations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was a time that I had an extended conversation (over several weeks) with AI about a challenging situation I faced at work that required me to carefully navigate a conversation with my direct report about her end of the year evaluation. While, by all accounts, she fully exceeded expectations, due to budget limitations within the department, only a limited number of "exceeds expectations" could be given across the department, and I was forced to give her a "successfully meets expectations" rating. I admittedly shared my shock and frustration with AI before finally asking it to help me brainstorm ways to speak with my supervisor to explore appealing this decision. AI helped me come up with points to discuss with my supervisor, but when the decision to appeal was not approved, I shifted and used AI to help me figure out a way to share the news with my colleague (given the context of her year at work) while still being supportive and to ensure it did not feel dismissive of her efforts that year. AI was helpful in coming up with both talking points and drafts that could be used in written communication. This was a conversation that I came back to AI for ideas and feedback over several weeks. The conversation with my direct report ultimately went very well, and I credit AI with helping me figure out how to best share the information with confidence and care.

AI: That sounds like a really challenging situation to navigate, and it's interesting how you used AI as a thinking partner throughout that extended process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, this is something that I've considered. Given my workload, I tend to rely on AI as a timesaver, especially with my written communication, and I worry there may be a point that I rely too heavily on AI and might lose my ability to think through and complete written tasks for myself. As a strong writer, this does concern me, especially knowing how satisfying it is for me to be able to communicate ideas and information in nuanced and creative ways. I don't want to give all of that power over to AI as I don't want to lose my written communication skills, but there are times I recognize that the amount of work on my plate requires that I consider how to best use my time, and AI is helpful with that.

AI: That tension between efficiency and skill preservation seems like something many people are grappling with. It sounds like you're quite conscious of finding that balance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see myself exploring other ways to use AI to save time, expanding this beyond written communication. I'd like to explore using AI to help with administrative tasks like organizing data, large-scale scheduling and even for end of year data assessment (though I don't know exactly what this might entail yet). I think using AI in these ways would be a great way to continue saving my time at work, and might give me the opportunity to spend more time working on written tasks with minimal AI support (as a way to assist with the skill preservation discussed earlier).

AI: That's a thoughtful way to think about it - potentially using AI more for administrative tasks so you can preserve the creative writing work you value.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're balancing efficiency with skill preservation, and the way you adapt your interaction style based on whether you're doing defined tasks versus more creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered it all

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in an educational environment, the thoughtful way you approach privacy considerations, and how you're thinking about balancing efficiency with maintaining your skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the concerns you have around AI use at work. Have a great rest of your day!
