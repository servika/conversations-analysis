Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! I don't have any questions at this time.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Okay. For context, I work as a writer/editor.  None of my clients use AI for content generation at this time, but I've been encouraged to use it for tasks that can make my writing/editing process more efficient (saving the clients money, and myself time). For example, if writing an article about bank accounts with promotional offers, I might use AI to compile a list of banks I should look into and their contact numbers. (Of course, I'd then contact the banks myself to confirm the current promotions/details rather than relying solely on the model's output.) I've found AI useful for the starting phase of research. Its output isn't perfect, but usually helps me get the ball rolling in terms of sourcing leads and creating an initial outline. As an editor, I have sometimes used AI as a second set of eyes -- particularly for catching typos or minor grammatical errors that can be easy to overlook when you're staring at a computer screen all day! It gives me that extra bit of confidence before submitting the completed draft. In a previous position, when working as the leader of a team of writers, I also used AI for some administrative tasks (for example, working collaboratively with the model to create a content schedule and keep track of the status of my writers' assignments).

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you've found some specific niches where AI adds value to your workflow without replacing the core creative and verification work you do.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Absolutely. I prefer to do the bulk of the writing and deeper research on my own. Regarding research, I simply don't have confidence that any of the models I have used are providing accurate information 100% of the time. I primarily write/edit in the field of personal finance and consumer/lifestyle topics, and in most cases, the best source for information about those things is still a human being with direct knowledge of the topic I'm writing about (usually an employee of the company I'm writing about). Regarding writing, I think my value as a contributor is in my human voice and perspective, as well as comprehensive knowledge of the style that is expected from my clients. A model could be trained to follow said style, and perhaps even to mimic my voice, but as useful as I find AI, I still think human creativity is crucial to my field.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've clearly thought through where your unique human expertise adds the most value versus where AI can be a helpful tool.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to delegate basic tasks -- essentially, asking the model to find information for me, and then using that information on my own rather than collaborating with the model or asking it to work through drafts with me. I kind of use it as a more intelligent extension of a web search the majority of the time.

AI: That's an interesting approach - treating it more like an enhanced search tool rather than a collaborative partner. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: To be honest, I was quite closed off to the idea of using AI in my work at all when one of my clients first introduced the idea! This was in the very early days of chatgpt gaining public attention. My client was an early adopter, and I was much more hesitant. Through speaking with clients and colleagues about it, and as more of my clients come to expect AI to be implemented into our processes, I've come to see it as a helpful tool rather than something to avoid.

AI: That's a fascinating shift - from initial resistance to finding it genuinely helpful. It sounds like the client and colleague conversations really shaped your perspective.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've been particularly frustrated when using it for image generation. I had a client who really wanted me to begin using it to create a featured image for each of my articles, so he would no longer need to license stock photography for that purpose. The first time I tried to create an image, I got a person with completely blacked out eyes! Nightmare fuel! I think my frustration came from my own lack of experience and skill at the time rather than from the model itself. I have a lot to learn when it comes to carefully crafting prompts to create good images.

AI: That does sound like nightmare fuel! It's interesting how that experience highlighted the learning curve involved in working effectively with AI tools.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think about this often. It's hard not to wonder whether writers will be completely replaced by AI in the future. Media budgets are small, the online content environment is ridiculously competitive, and my clients are always looking for ways to cut costs. However, even if there may come a time when it's no longer possible to continue on this career path, I will always maintain my skills in writing/editing. Even if I'm writing for an audience of zero, it's something I've been passionate about since childhood, and I don't see myself ever giving it up.

AI: That passion and commitment to your craft really comes through. It sounds like you've found a way to think about this that honors both the practical realities and your deeper connection to writing.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that as AI continues to develop and improve, it will become more useful to me. I can see it possibly taking on heavier lifting with some of the research, or being incorporated more heavily into the draft revision process. I can also see it becoming very useful for administrative tasks like scheduling and assignment-tracking, if it gets to a point where it can do those things with flawless accuracy.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your initial resistance shifted through client conversations, and how you've carved out this role for AI as an enhanced search tool while keeping the core creative work for yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing comes to mind!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to hear about your journey from initial hesitation to finding practical ways to integrate AI while maintaining your creative expertise.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
