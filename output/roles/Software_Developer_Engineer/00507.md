Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good !

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well I am a software developer working on fullstack development. My tasks are usually composed of fixing bugs implementing new features, optimizing code and refactoring code. I use AI like copilot to refactor code sometimes because it helps me with repetitions. I do the initial "pattern" and then the AI is usually good at repeating it with small changes. Then there's code optimization. Sometimes I notice some functions that seem to be very long and confusing so I just copy paste them into a ai chatbot and ask for variations that are more elegant. The most elegant solution made with a little tweak usually improves the code. I also use  AI for research when I am stuck on something while developing a feature.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you're using AI across several different aspects of your development work. 

When you mentioned getting stuck while developing a feature and using AI for research, can you tell me more about what that looks like? What kind of information are you typically looking for in those moments?

User: Often it's some SQL parsing function that I don't understand like a json_manipulation inside a sql script or some memory leaks that I can't identify inside a node middleware

AI: That makes sense - those are pretty specific technical issues. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I choose to do tasks that are simple to understand of medium complexity by myself since I can imagine  a lot of possible ways to write that task pretty quickly in my head and choose the best one. I let AI handle more complex tasks and refine them later since it's hard to generate those possibilities for me.

AI: That's an interesting approach - using your own judgment for tasks where you can easily evaluate the options, but leveraging AI when the solution space is harder to navigate.

When you do use AI for those more complex tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it the complete task and then refine what it produces?

User: I would say my pattern is often: "How to implement X in this function Y" then paste the context (functions and adjutant code) once I get the result more often than not I have to specify even more precisely what I need and then ask to give alternatives to the solution generated. At the end I choose the cleanest solution.

AI: So it sounds like there's quite a bit of back-and-forth refinement happening - you're definitely collaborating rather than just getting one answer and moving on.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about it with your team, or is it more of an individual thing?

User: I would say it's more of an individual thing most of my colleagues also use AI but in a very similar way so there's not much argumentation going around.  Our workplace does recommend using AI for speed and productivity, but I often try to use it with caution

AI: You mentioned trying to use it with caution - that's interesting. What makes you approach it that way? What are you being cautious about?

User: I would say that sometimes the quality of the code produced is not great and once I feel like I simply need to finish the task and I don't pay attention to what is generated I sometimes see that I committed or made code that is subpar in terms of quality. That code usually can be much simpler.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - it sounds like there's a tension between the pressure to move quickly and maintaining code quality.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When refactoring code I feel the most satisfied because it makes exactly what I want and it saves a loooot of time. The most frustrating part is when something very complex comes up and I spend a lot of time tweaking the prompt to get the right answer, but at the end I just lose time and the ai is always answering like it's the perfect answer and no alternatives are available so it creates some tension between time, quality and lack of alternatives

AI: That frustration really comes through - especially that disconnect where the AI presents its answer with such confidence even when it's not quite hitting the mark you need.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't see ai taking over complex software engineering. I try to focus on good patterns of development and I try to focus on complex tasks. Easy sub 10k lines project will be taken over by ai, but thats only for projects with low stakes. I am not worried too much I think AI will be more like an assistant

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on AI as more of an assistant for complex work rather than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you interact with it, or expect it to get better at the things that frustrate you now?

User: I think I will still interact with it in the same way, but I will use it for more use cases not just programming

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance speed versus code quality, and your cautious approach to making sure you stay engaged with what the AI produces.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the challenges with code quality when rushing, and your thoughtful approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
