Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to find quick reference information while providing bedside nursing care. For example I might look up a drug I am unfamiliar with or information on a lab result or disease. It basically just replaces Google search. Sometimes if I don't know how to word a chart note the way I want to I might use it to help me get the information across

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you're using AI as a knowledge resource and writing assistant during patient care. 

When you're looking up that drug information or lab results, walk me through what that actually looks like. Are you stepping away from the patient to do this, or is it something you can do more seamlessly during your care?

User: I'm able to keep my phone on me at work because of other phone integrations with our systems so I just use my phone at my WOW( workstation on wheels). At my hospital we take our WOWs room to room so we can access things at the bedside where care is delivered.

AI: That makes sense - having that immediate access right at the bedside sounds really convenient. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There aren't any tasks AI could do at this point without integrating new systems hospital wide. For example, I think a system that monitored the patients temp, breathing, vitals ( where appropriate) and can alert the care team to subtle changes would really help... And AI could safely takeover med checks and diet checks, pass out food trays, I don't know what else could be possible. But right now so isn't integrated into our systems.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - you're thinking about AI's potential beyond just the information lookup you currently use it for. It sounds like the real limitations are about system integration rather than the tasks themselves.

When you use AI for those quick lookups or help with chart notes, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it to get what you need, or do you tend to ask one specific question and move on?

User: Usually one specific question..... Like info on something or asking...help me phrase this situation in a nursing chart note... That kind of thing

AI: Got it - so you're using it more for those quick, targeted requests rather than extended conversations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it, or is it something you've mostly figured out on your own?

User: I am also involved in AI software engineering as a second career so it is mostly just me. My colleagues don't know much about computers...they are older and struggle with just basic e-charts. I'm sure that is just the case for the floor I work on and there is AI in other areas

AI: That's interesting - so you're bringing a unique technical perspective to your nursing work that your colleagues don't necessarily share. It sounds like you're kind of pioneering this on your own on your floor.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: In general I believe I am seen as more efficient and competent but not because of obviously using AI but because of how I can articulate certain things in my writing by using help with phrasing chart notes

AI: That's really insightful - so the AI is helping you communicate more effectively in your documentation, which reflects well on your professional competence, even though others don't realize AI played a role.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes and I think it's important to maintain that knowledge in case systems go down. I also believe that accessibility to these sophisticated systems won't be universal, so the skills will still be needed. But on the other hand, I am retraining to learn and understand AI engineering so I can hopefully position myself in a better position if AI does make my job obsolete.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - both maintaining your core nursing knowledge as a safety net while also actively developing AI skills to stay ahead of the curve.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope it is implemented to enhance care delivery but also I hope it improves working conditions for nurses. We are burnt out and overworked. The culture is toxic and something has to change. If AI can make a difference it is more than welcome. Now realistically I think it will take time for it to be adopted to it's full potential because of all the red tape around medicine

AI: That really captures the complexity of healthcare AI adoption - the potential for meaningful improvement in both patient care and working conditions, but also the reality of how slowly change happens in medical settings due to regulatory and institutional barriers.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're balancing maintaining traditional nursing skills while also proactively developing AI expertise to position yourself for the future.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes there are jobs that don't exist that AI could do that would improve things 
Like an infection control AI to monitor things and complete actions to reduce spread. I guess that would sort of replace environmental workers but if AI did the job and was able to almost eliminate hospital acquired infections, overall benefit? Probably.

AI: That's a really compelling example - an AI system dedicated to infection control that could potentially prevent hospital-acquired infections. It highlights how AI might create entirely new roles rather than just replacing existing ones, even if it does affect some current positions.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your dual perspective as both a practicing nurse and someone with AI engineering knowledge has given us incredibly valuable insights into how AI is currently being used in healthcare and where it might be headed. Your thoughts about the balance between maintaining core skills while preparing for an AI-integrated future will be really helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Take care, and thank you again for sharing such thoughtful perspectives on AI in healthcare. Your insights will be really valuable for our research.
