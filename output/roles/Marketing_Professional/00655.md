Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions, let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am working on a couple of projects right now, revolving around building a new department. If I run into the task of having to write email templates for variations of a scenario, I typically use AI to draft those templates

AI: That sounds like a practical use case for building out a new department. When you use AI to draft those email templates, what happens next in your process? Do you typically use what it gives you as-is, or do you find yourself making changes?

User: I definitely find myself making changes. The templates are usually too casual; when I ask it to make it more formal, the writing becomes stiff.

AI: Tell me more about finding that balance between casual and formal. What does that adjustment process look like for you when you're trying to get the tone just right?

User: I have to take into account the target audience. AI doesn't know the details of the scenario as well as I do

AI: That's really interesting - the context and audience knowledge that you bring to the situation. Can you give me a specific example of how your understanding of the scenario or audience led you to modify what the AI suggested?

User: Well, specific templates go to specific people. Some of those canned emails are going to people that are professionals in the industry, so the email doesn't need to go into as much detail. When the canned emails are aimed at clients, such as buyers or sellers in a transaction, the language needs to be tweaked to be more approachable, while being careful not to give too much information as to lead them down rabbit holes.

AI: That's a nuanced understanding of how different audiences need different approaches. When you're making those adjustments - whether it's reducing detail for industry professionals or making language more approachable for clients - how do you typically go about that editing process? Do you rewrite sections completely or make smaller tweaks?

User: Sometimes I tell AI to rearrange the sections so I don't have to grapple with the transitions between sections. Then I do begin to remove some terms and replace them with others, add a sentence to explain something more, and then do the smaller tweaks to make things more/less formal.

AI: It sounds like you have a pretty systematic approach - using AI for structural help with rearranging, then diving into the content yourself for those more nuanced changes. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself from the start, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I don't consult AI for a lot of things, but I suppose I should. Some tasks where I am asked to screenshot content that would be helpful for Marketing or for designers I could probably ask AI for assistance with so I can zone in on what they could find useful for their needs

AI: That's thoughtful - recognizing there might be areas where AI could help that you haven't explored yet. When you do use AI, like with those email templates, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it the initial request and then take over from there?

User: I usually do a bit of back and forth. AI's first attempt is usually decent, but needs more direction after it gives a response.

AI: What does that direction usually focus on? Is it more about the content itself, or things like tone and structure, or something else entirely?

User: Usually structure and tone

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that people around you have particular attitudes about it, or has the environment shaped how you approach using these tools?

User: My manager is the one that got me using AI to assist with the email templates. In my industry of title/escrow services, agents and buyers/sellers like to have a "human touch" - and frankly, due to the sensitive nature of this industry, there are a lot of tasks that can't be handed over to AI. It's not a very AI-friendly industry

AI: That's fascinating - the tension between efficiency and that human touch requirement, especially in such a sensitive industry. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI did make me feel fairly frustrated once. I gave it very clear instructions and it still was not able to pull out all the bullet points from the emails I gave to it. I ended up just doing it manually after a few attempts to save myself time

AI: That sounds like a time-consuming experience. What was it about that particular task - extracting bullet points from emails - that seemed to trip up the AI despite your clear instructions?

User: It wanted to summarize everything when I wanted it verbatim. Then when it was verbatim, the formatting got messed up. Then the formatting went from bullets to a table. I decided to just do it myself

AI: That cycle of trying to get it to understand exactly what you needed sounds really frustrating. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't actively consider AI taking over in any areas in my field. It does not seem to be in the near future, at least to me

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it in different ways, or expanding into other types of tasks?

User: I could see my relationship evolving to have it take over some tasks, but not very many. If it became secure enough, I'd love for AI to have access to my work email so it could sift through meeting transcripts, emails, and notes I've made to myself to pull some data for me. But the security issue remains a blocker

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the balance between efficiency and the human touch that's so important in your industry, and how security concerns shape what's actually feasible.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thanks for chatting!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating tone and audience needs, the practical challenges with formatting and instructions, and especially the security considerations in sensitive industries will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
