Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, that all sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a novelist and also a freelance content and copy writer. I use AI far more in my work as a content writer than when working on my novels. I work for various clients across a variety of topics but a typical project would be working for a hotel chain locate in a certain country who would ask me to write a series of articles about tourism in that area. Some such articles might cover: when is the best time to travel to said country, Some top tips for travelling there with children or pets, What are the best festivals and local events to catch in that country, etc.

AI: That's really helpful context - so you're working across both long-form creative writing and more commercial content creation. I'm curious about that distinction you mentioned between how you use AI in your content writing versus your novels.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process when you're working on those tourism articles for clients. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI (generally ChatGPT) in the early stages of the article process. I first ask the model the basic premise of my article, I ask it to list the top ten festivals for tourists in France or to give me 20 tips for travelling to Portugal with children or when is the best time to visit Bali and why?
I will then use this information as a jumping off point for my own research, looking up each point that the model made, fact checking it and adding more information as I find it. 

Once I have all my research done and I have done a rough first draft, of the articles body, I tend to put that draft into a chat and ask the model to create an introductory paragraph, I do this because I always struggle to  come up with the first lines of an article, and staring at a blank page is not helpful, once the model has given me a starting point the rest of the article flows much more easily. However I always rewrite that introduction myself during my edits so that no part of the article is AI written as many of my clients prohibit this. 

I may also feed the finished article into a chat and ask the model to create a except of around 60 words, an SEO-optimised tag line and a tweet linking to the article. I do this because the model will often pull out points that I had not realised were key and I can then blend the model and my own highlights to create strong links. 

I have custom preferences set for my chats so that the model knows the clents preferese tone and style and what the end goal for the article is.

AI: That's fascinating - you've developed a really structured approach where AI serves as a starting point and support tool, but you maintain control over the final content. I love that detail about using AI to overcome the blank page problem with introductions.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you moved through that process?

User: In another project for a tech comparison site I was editing a series of articles comparing very similar tech products. part of my role was to add in pros and cons for each of the products in each of the articles. It was very repetitive work and when doing it myself I struggled to come up with varied pro/cons for each product each time, especially since the article and research wasn't my own so I did not know the products all that well. 
I fed the almost complete articles into a chat and asked the model to come up with 3 different pros and cons for each product mentions using information from the articles and the models knowledge of the products as a whole, stressing that each one should be different from the others and the model should avoid using generic information that could apply to all of them. 
Again the preferences were set so the model knew which tone and language to use. 
I found this method sped up my editing process considerable. I had to fact check some of the information but doing so was much faster than me struggling to create 50+ individually varied pro/cons on my own.

AI: That sounds like it was a real game-changer for that repetitive but important task. When you were working through that process - feeding the articles in, getting the varied pros and cons back, then fact-checking - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what was driving the creative decisions in that workflow?

User: I was driving the creative decisions. I spent a substantial amount of time crafting the ideal prompt for the model so it knew exactly what I was looking for and what needed to be done. I included rules on where the information was to come from, the language and tone to use, the length of the responses, some words and phrases to avoid, and the exact format of the answers. I corrected the model if it did not follow all the instructions and modified and reran the prompt if necessary to get appropriate answers. I then fact-checked and edited every response before including anything in the live articles.

AI: That really comes through - you clearly maintained control over the entire process and were very intentional about how you directed the AI. You mentioned earlier that you use AI much more in your content writing than in your novels. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: As I mentioned earlier, I use AI to get a jump start on my tasks. Starting a job from scratch can feel a little overwhelming, and knowing I have a tool that can give me personalised research and help me get started takes away some of the reluctance to tackle a task. 

In my novel writing, I do not use AI for anything to do with story or plot, as I would then not feel that it was all my own work. However, I will use it to generate names of fictional people and places, especially if they are not integral to the story. Getting stuck because I can't think of a  name for the local sheriff who is only in one scene, or the town my characters' grandmother grew up in that is not mentioned again, can derail a productive writing session. Using AI can prevent the interruption.

AI: That's such an insightful distinction - using AI to remove friction and keep your creative momentum going, rather than for the core creative content itself. It sounds like you've found ways to preserve what feels authentically "yours" while still benefiting from AI's capabilities.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have concerns that content and copywriting jobs will be fulfilled more and more by AI over the coming years, and so jobs such as these will no longer be available to me. I understand why this will happen, as businesses can get their content written faster and cheaper by AI. I don't fear that this will put me out of a job because I am a flexible worker and believe that my role will change rather than be eradicated. I think - ethical businesses at least- will still want some human eyes on their content and, rather than writing the work, my role will perhaps be to craft the prompt for the AI to work with and to fact-check and edit once it's done. I also think there will still be a market for 'human-written' content, as some clients will always prefer that. 

In terms of novel writing, I don't believe we have anything to fear from AI's writing books. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. If they do, perhaps AI-written prose could become a genre in itself, another option available for people who want to read it, but not removing the need for human-written books.

AI: That's such a balanced perspective - seeing it as an evolution of your role rather than a replacement. Your point about ethical businesses still wanting human oversight resonates with how you already work with AI as a collaborator rather than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate changing how you use these tools?

User: Perhaps as these tools become more refined, I will begin to use them more; currently, the need for constant fact-checking and double-checking prevents me from using them in certain ways. I would like to use AI to do jobs I find tedious, such as proofreading and grammar checking my final work, but I would currently have to perform a further check after it had finished, which negates the point. 

Also, as said above, perhaps the way I look for new work will change. Rather than seeking writing roles, I will seek prompt writing roles, and rather than standard editing work, I will be looking for jobs editing AI's work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while using AI strategically to overcome specific friction points - like the blank page problem with introductions and getting unstuck on minor details in your novels.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency while leveraging AI as a strategic tool, and your thoughtful approach to adapting your professional role rather than seeing AI as a threat, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and limitations you've encountered. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
