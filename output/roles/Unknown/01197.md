Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Absolutely! Let's go!

AI: Wonderful! I love your enthusiasm. 

Let's start at the beginning then. Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I think like a lot of creatives, I have multiple projects going simultaneously. I'm not a narrow-focus creative who does one type of work and that's it - I write, I edit, I do multimedia crafts, painting, extremely niche restoration techniques, I do graphic design, printing, and even some web design. I do a lot of experimenting and testing - most projects involve some level of learning on the fly. Other than straightforward printing, there's no "typical project flow."

AI: That's fascinating - you really span a huge range of creative disciplines. It sounds like you thrive on that variety and constant learning. 

With such a diverse creative practice, walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools across all these different areas?

User: Lately I've been using it to do some research on new techniques - maybe I heard someone mention something in passing that I've never done, and I'll do a surface level recon on my own and think it MIGHT fit in my skill sets/abilities. I'll have a chat with an AI to see what other chatter is out there, and see if I'm overlooking potential pitfalls implementing that with the tools I have. For example, I asked about waterslide decals one time after hearing about it - it seemed like a good potential fit for some restoration work, but after deeper AI conversations combined with my practical knowledge, I determined it probably wouldn't be viable with the printer I have now. Better to find out via chat with an AI than to try it on an important project and ruin it with running ink.

AI: That's a really smart approach - using AI as a way to test the waters before committing resources or risking a project. The waterslide decal example is perfect - you essentially used the AI conversation to help you think through the practical constraints.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes! I found some plush patterns I was iterating on in a huge backlog - probably ten years they had been waiting for me to get time to finish them. I had no notes or ideas about what I was going to do to finish it. The body was stuffed, but it had no eyes, and I was out of inspiration at that moment. I shared a WIP picture and asked the AI what color would look good. I expected just a text response, but the AI actually edited my picture and put eyes on the plush. I was a little surprised, then impressed, and then I looked at the eyes more closely. They looked like googly eyes you might glue on a sock puppet, not polished eyes you would actually put on a soft plush animal. I was disappointed once I thought about it a little more - just the text would have been fine in that case instead of making my work look goofy.

AI: That's such an interesting experience - you went from surprise to impressed to disappointed all in one interaction. It sounds like the AI overstepped in a way, giving you more than you asked for but not necessarily what you actually needed.

When you say the eyes looked like "googly eyes you might glue on a sock puppet" versus "polished eyes you would actually put on a soft plush animal" - tell me more about that difference. What did the AI miss about the level of craftsmanship you were aiming for?

User: I do very intricate hand-embroidered and appliqued eyes - not a plastic "punch through and done" type, which is what the edited image looked like. The plush was already sewn up and stuffed, and the level of craftsmanship should have been a hint that gluing plastic eyes on top was inappropriate.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the AI completely misread the craftsmanship level you were working at. Your hand-embroidered and appliqued work requires a totally different approach than mass-produced toy assembly, and the fact that you'd already invested that level of detail should have been obvious from the image.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in these interactions?

User: When I need some creative inspiration, I'll turn to the AI as a first pass or open new avenues for exploration. I was trying to do research for a fun Halloween-themed candy project based on fictional candy with some 80s and 90s movies nostalgia factor, and unfortunately the AI didn't get it - it suggested Harry Potter candy (wrong era) and SpongeBob Krabby Patties (not candy). Going deeper seemed to have just led to hallucinations. That one was pretty disappointing. Obviously I didn't get what I needed there, so I discarded the suggestions and went in a different direction, since my first attempt didn't have the meat to support it. But in other cases, when I'm just spitballing, the AI might get me on the path just enough I can get creative and finish the idea (color choices, new designs, that sort of thing).

AI: That Halloween candy example really illustrates the limits - the AI completely missed the cultural context you were looking for and then seemed to double down with hallucinations when you tried to guide it deeper. But it sounds like there's a sweet spot where AI can give you just enough of a creative nudge to get your own ideas flowing.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Unfortunately I've given up writing. That has been the most easily displaced by AI - passable text if you aren't going for something extremely niche is pretty easy for AI these days. It can even edit AND read handwriting now, so those avenues I used to have have closed (for paying work). On the other hand, I'm a huge fan of messing around with image iteration via AI - I'll get the base idea out via AI, and then I use that output to guide a painted image by hand (or polish it digitally with image editing/repainting). I found the AI can get me the base layout I need to translate that into unusual art pieces - things I wouldn't have painted just on my own, but are "out there" enough I can get actual purchasers. That really surprised me!

AI: That's such a striking contrast - losing your writing work while discovering this new collaborative approach with visual art that's actually opening up market opportunities. The fact that AI-generated base layouts are helping you create pieces that are "out there" enough to find buyers is really intriguing.

Tell me more about that visual collaboration process. When you say the AI helps you create things you "wouldn't have painted just on your own" - what's happening there that's different from your usual creative process?

User: I think my usual style tends more to standard cartoon/comics/sketches - left on my own, I'm going to draw something with obvious outlines, color fills, and simplified shapes. The AI has pushed me to a more psychedelic, abstract shapes plus organic creatures, more negative space images, interesting color choices.

AI: That's fascinating - the AI is actually expanding your artistic vocabulary and pushing you into territories you wouldn't naturally explore. It sounds like it's breaking you out of your comfort zone in ways that are commercially successful too.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I think I already touched on the writing issues. Unfortunately a lot of writing online now feels inauthentic. I've stopped reading any recent books - I went back to the classics to keep up with the feel of a well-crafted story with intriguing writing. I don't know if we'll ever see another Nabokov-level writer is AI assistance become standard in the future.

I know a lot of people outwardly say AI is going to kill art, but I don't think that's true. I was around for early digital art and remember that same type of resistance to anything "easy" to undo making art "less" somehow. As I'm seeing it, AI is actually helping me do new and intriguing things. The problem is a lot of online art spaces are super knee-jerk/witch hunting people who use AI at all, so...I've had to keep my enthusiasm for it off the radar! I hope in a few more years that will change and I won't have to hide the AI inspiration for the base painting ideas.

AI: That's such a nuanced perspective - you're seeing both the displacement happening in writing and the creative expansion in visual art, while also dealing with the social dynamics around AI use in creative communities.

The parallel you draw to early digital art resistance is really insightful. And it sounds like you're having to navigate this strange situation where AI is genuinely enhancing your work, but you can't openly discuss that process because of community reactions.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'm hoping the image editing in the AI programs gets a bit more fluid (some of this may be my hardware limitations at the moment more than the actual capabilities). I think I saw a demo a bit ago where you could wireframe a still image and drag the subject around at points to move the head and legs, and the AI would be able to reposition the subject naturally from that - that looks so cool! I'm also looking forward to better personalization/memory, so we won't see those awkward suggestions about plastic googly eyes on my high-end plushies. ;) 

I'm not sure if I'm 100% on board with the AI helping me keep track of sales/profit, given its current problems with numbers, but over time I can see that being a time saving point as well - as well as a "business partner" of sorts that can track trends of what's working and what isn't.

AI: Those improvements sound like they'd really enhance your workflow - especially the image manipulation capabilities and the memory aspect so AI can better understand your craftsmanship level. And the idea of AI as a "business partner" for tracking trends is intriguing, though I can definitely see why you'd want to wait until the math gets more reliable!

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI across such a diverse creative practice. I particularly appreciated how you've navigated both the displacement you've experienced in writing and the genuine creative expansion you've found in visual work, plus your perspective on the community dynamics around AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: So, I'm not doing it yet, BUT I'm really intrigued about the possibility of reigniting my musical interests with AI and finally composing songs. I could see this being similar to my early experimenting with digital art - I try it for fun, but over time and with experimentation, eventually I can incorporate it into more multimedia based projects. I guess I'm much more open to experimenting and I personally don't feel it diminishes me or my creativity - it gives me opportunities to participate in something I enjoy but couldn't do on my own. :)

AI: That's a perfect note to end on! Your openness to experimentation and seeing AI as expanding what you can participate in rather than diminishing your creativity really captures something important. The parallel you draw to your early digital art experimentation suggests you have a great sense for how these tools might evolve in your practice over time.

It sounds like music could be the next frontier where AI helps you access a creative domain that was previously out of reach - much like how it's pushed your visual work into new territories you wouldn't have explored on your own.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating both the challenges and genuine creative opportunities with AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your honesty about both the wins and the disappointments!
