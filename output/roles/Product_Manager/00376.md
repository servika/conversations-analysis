Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. No questions from me.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI a huge amount in my day job. I'm a Product Manager at a regulator in the United Kingdom and am responsible for a software application. As a result, my use tends to be ad hoc. I might use it to draft a Product Requirements Document, to draft test scripts, or some user stories. It doesn't get used as part of a specific routine.

AI: That's really helpful context. As a Product Manager at a UK regulator, it sounds like you're turning to AI for specific documentation and planning tasks when they come up.

When you do use AI for something like drafting a Product Requirements Document or user stories, what draws you to use it for those particular tasks versus handling them completely on your own?

User: I would say that there are two main drivers. The first is often time pressure - if I am in a rush then having generative AI at my fingertips can accelerate my progress. The second is that an LLM will often align whatever I draft with best practice which tends to be useful. Using an AI chatbot is a good way of making sure I am doing things the right way.

AI: That's fascinating - so you're leveraging AI both as a time-saver and as a kind of best practice guide. 

Tell me more about that second point. How does the AI help you align with best practice? Are you asking it to review what you've written, or does it naturally incorporate those standards when you're drafting from scratch?

User: AI helps me align with best practice by applying relevant formats and structures (e.g. the test scripts that I used Copilot to work on earlier today identified preconditions and postconditions and reminded me of the need to employ negative testing). I typically either provide the AI with source material (a requirements worksheet) or a detailed Prompt and see what I get in return. The material that I share provides context but the standards are applied by the chatbot.

AI: That's a great example - having the AI remind you about negative testing and structure the preconditions and postconditions shows how it's filling in those professional knowledge gaps in real time.

When you're working on these tasks with AI, do you find yourself going back and forth with it - refining and collaborating throughout the process - or do you typically give it your initial prompt and requirements and then work independently with what it gives you back?

User: Most of the time one shot suffices. Occasionally, I have to iterate but I would say that is a rare occurrence. To be honest, I lack the patience and/or start to doubt whether I am using the AI in the right way when I hit a road block.

AI: That's really honest and insightful - that sense of self-doubt when iterations don't go smoothly. It sounds like when AI works well for you, it works quickly and cleanly.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Is it something that's openly discussed or encouraged at your organization?

User: My colleagues haven't really changed the way that I use AI. One of my team mates is a huge fan of ChatGPT but the wider organisation is moving relatively slowly. Most initiatives are driven by individuals. A new AI Policy has been shared and there has been the odd pilot. However, there is often uncertainty about whether actions are endorsed and natural concern regarding the risks of a data incident. Ideally, we would have a local model. I do know that the Chair and CEO are very enthusiastic though.

AI: That paints a clear picture - you're operating in that interesting space where leadership is enthusiastic but there's still organizational caution around data security and formal endorsement.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'll give you both. AI made me feel particularly satisfied about 6 months ago when I was able to draft my annual appraisal contributions. It really removed the friction and tedium from the process. AI at work made me frustrated when I attempted to use a ChatGPT integration for data analysis - it just didn't work but I suspect I didn't persevere for long enough.

AI: Those are great contrasting examples. The annual appraisal situation sounds like AI hit that sweet spot - removing tedium from something you had to do anyway.

Tell me more about that data analysis frustration. What were you trying to accomplish, and what made you decide to stop rather than keep working through it?

User: I was trying to identify key themes relating to durations and risk profiles in a caseload but for some reason it just didn't work that well.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's something I consider a lot. I feel that I need to develop skills in this area or I will get left behind, especially over the course of a career. I have taken DeepLearning AI's AI for Everyone course, a Google AI Essentials, and a Google Prompting Essentials. I also listen to the Daily AI Podcast. I am less concerned about AI fully taking over because I think you need a human to deal with other humans, especially in my role. However, I am concerned about humans with better AI skills out competing me.

AI: That's a very thoughtful approach - actively building your AI literacy while recognizing the human elements that remain essential in your role. It sounds like you see it more as augmenting your capabilities rather than replacing you entirely.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your usage patterns might change as your organization becomes more comfortable with it, or as your own skills develop?

User: I think I will use AI a lot more as it becomes more accepted and less experimental. It feels like we are very early in a transformational change. I also believe that I will use AI for a much wider range of things as the technology develops. Right now AI agents aren't that widely adopted but there's tremendous scope for them to reduce repetitive tasks. Similarly, I don't currently do basic things like developing a Prompt library for myself or my team. Obviously, as I become more familiar with the use cases I will apply them but that depends on a mixture of my understanding developing as well as my appetite for risk at my workplace.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're proactively building AI skills while recognizing the inherent human elements in your role, and that tension between individual enthusiasm and organizational caution around data security.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. That's all from me. Thanks for your time.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI adoption in a regulated environment, balancing efficiency with best practices, and the reality of working within organizational constraints will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candid perspective on both the satisfying and frustrating moments - that kind of honest feedback is exactly what helps us understand the real-world experience of working with AI tools.

Have a great rest of your day!
