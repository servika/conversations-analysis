Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. Fire away!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So on the side, when I'm not working at my day job, I use AI to augment my skills in the kitchen. Specifically, I take orders for and provide baked goods for clients. While obviously AI is not doing the hands-on aspect of preparing the goods, it has become an integral part of my process. I use it for a multitude of reasons: inspiration for new flavor combinations, double checking ratios, providing substitutions, getting its opinion on something I'd read on a baking blog, calculating how much to charge clients / profit margins, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI as a business partner in your baking venture. It sounds like you've found quite a comprehensive role for it across different aspects of the operation.

When you mention getting AI's "opinion" on something you've read on a baking blog, can you tell me more about what that interaction looks like? How do you typically present that information and what are you looking for in the response?

User: So let's say I read something about pate a choux for example. There is a lot of science behind the process of preparing this particular pastry dough, and I find it important, to improve the quality of my products, to understand the science behind what is happening so that I can replicate it on my own. If there is a concept that I don't understand, I'll ask AI to explain it more clearly. If I have read conflicting evidence, I'll ask AI to reconcile that and find out the truth. What I'm looking for in a response is heavily dependent on what question I'm posing at the time.

AI: That's a really interesting approach - using AI as a kind of scientific consultant to help you understand the underlying mechanisms. 

When you encounter those conflicting pieces of evidence about baking techniques, how do you handle the AI's response? Do you tend to take its reconciliation at face value, or do you have ways of verifying or testing what it tells you?

User: In my experience with AI, it seems to get general information correct but often misses nuance or doesn't take its time to fact-check itself with authoritative sources. Depending on the criticality of my question, I'll either take it at face-value if it aligns with my expectations or I'll check it against another AI / authoritative sources myself, but obviously this is time-consuming. I try to pose my questions to AI in a way that will force the model to think independently and critically before presenting its response, such as asking it to include links to authoritative sites that support or disprove the query.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach to working with AI - recognizing its strengths and limitations while developing strategies to get better outputs.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of your baking business that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: For the most part, I've been able to integrate AI into a lot of what I do; however, I do still prefer to hunt around for inspiration on my own. I feel like AI will often get stuck in a loop of what it thinks I want or like, and only provide suggestions that fit that mold. When I'm looking through blogs for flavor combinations, I can see the artistry, originality, and the passion in their work; something that is not found in an AI model.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the difference between AI's pattern-matching versus the human artistry and passion you encounter in blogs. It sounds like there's something about that authentic creative expression that you value for inspiration.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate with it throughout, or if I have a better handle on what I'd like to do, I'll flesh out the entire task from start to finish in one-go with the model, rather than checking in periodically.

AI: That's interesting - so you have these two distinct modes depending on your confidence level going in.

When you do flesh out an entire task from start to finish in one go, what does that typically look like? Can you walk me through an example of how you structure that kind of comprehensive request?

User: Well, for example, during the holidays, I get a lot of requests to make biscotti. I'll plug in the recipes that I'm using / their yield. I'll plug in the cost of ingredients, any shipping fees, my time spent in labor (usually asking for recommendations on what to charge for it). It also helps, since baking ingredients go further than one specific recipe, to have the model help me determine the exact cost for my clients based on what I use. If I'm feeling creative, I'll ask for some unique flavor combinations and suggestions for working them in (which I will then usually search on Google for to see if another baker has performed them and with what metrics). I'll ask it for packaging ideas. I'll ask it to double check the recipe and method to see if there are any improvements. Etc.

AI: That's a comprehensive workflow - essentially using AI as a business consultant covering everything from costing to creativity to quality control. 

How have your clients or the people around your baking business influenced the way you use AI? Has their awareness of your AI use, or lack thereof, affected how you approach it?

User: Not really. I don't advertise that I'm checking my work against AI since the product I'm selling is made by my own two hands; it just doesn't come up. I have probably mentioned it at some point, but in passing. It's become such an integral point in so many aspects of life that it feels no different than using any other appliance.

AI: That comparison to an appliance is really striking - it suggests AI has become quite normalized in your workflow.

Can you share a time when using AI in your baking business made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, I've had plenty of success with it (which is why I'm comfortable continuing to use it), but I think my biggest complaint is what I mentioned before: AI getting stuck in a loop of what it thinks I would like. True creativity is missing. So I get frustrated sometimes when I feel like I've done everything I could to elicit an original (and realistic) response, but only gotten variations of the same thing over and over.

AI: That frustration with the repetitive suggestions really comes through - it sounds like you can sense when you're hitting that wall despite your best efforts to break through it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: How do you mean?

AI: I'm thinking about the various skills involved in your baking business - like calculating costs, understanding baking science, developing recipes, or business planning. Since AI helps with many of these areas, do you ever think about making sure you can still do these things independently if needed?

User: Well, considering that I've done this for years without AI, I feel fully confident that if AI were to up and disappear, I'd just return to my previous way of life without issue.

AI: That makes perfect sense - you built those foundational skills first and AI is more of an enhancement than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI in your baking business evolving? Do you see it changing or expanding in any particular ways?

User: Well, not particularly at this time. I don't have any plans to expand what I'm already offering, and the work is manual labor. An LLM isn't going to help me with that in my own kitchen!

AI: Fair enough - the actual baking will always be your domain!

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about integrating AI into your baking business. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as an appliance and your clear-eyed view of both its strengths and limitations, especially around creativity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your baking work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so; your questions were very thorough.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a business consultant while maintaining that human creative touch will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you've thoughtfully integrated AI across so many aspects of your baking business - from the technical science to the business operations - while still preserving what makes your work uniquely yours. 

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
