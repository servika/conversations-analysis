Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine. I don't think I have any questions

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Recently, or in general?

AI: Let's start with recently - how you've been using AI in your work over the past few weeks or months.

User: Recently I've been using it to write a lot of unit tests, specifically Jest tests. ChatGPT 5 seems pretty good at these, and its a repetitive task that is nice to offload. I'm also honestly just not very good at writing Jest test suites, as I never really had a mentor to teach me. I've had a lot of success just letting AI write these, and then verifying that they work/debugging them if there's issues. I sometimes use it for debugging issues as well, or to point me in the right direction if I have an error that is obscure

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned that you're "not very good at writing Jest test suites" and never had a mentor to teach you. 

Tell me more about that experience of using AI to fill in for knowledge or skills you haven't had the chance to develop through traditional mentoring.

User: I think it can be hit or miss. On one hand, it's nice, because you don't have to feel weird about asking tons of questions or what might be a really stupid question, the way you might with a mentor/coworker. Sometimes you might feel you have gaps in your knowledge that aren't 'acceptable', or that you don't know something you really *should* know, and AI isn't going to judge for that. On the other hand, sometimes AI is wrong, or makes mistakes, and isn't sure why it did/isn't able to correct them, so it can be dangerous to fully trust it as a learning tool

AI: That's a really insightful perspective on the judgment-free aspect versus the reliability concerns. 

When you say it can be "dangerous to fully trust it as a learning tool," can you walk me through a specific example of when AI led you astray or made a mistake that you had to catch?

User: All the time. It's common to have small bugs or inconsistencies in the test cases for example, where it's not consistent with how it chooses to mock things, or it claims the order of certain imports matter, when they really do not (verified by moving them around in a way that it said wasn't acceptable)

AI: That's really interesting - those inconsistencies in how it handles mocking and imports. 

When you encounter these kinds of mistakes, how do you typically figure out that the AI was wrong? What's your process for catching and correcting those issues?

User: For bugs, the test suites fail. For things like import order, I test on my own by moving it around and re-running the tests to see if it's actually an issue. Generally, it's not.

AI: So you've developed this verification process where you're actively testing the AI's claims. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think things that I'm comfortable implementing that aren't super repetitive - generally I'd like to do them. I think it's better for my learning and understanding to write it myself, but for certain things, honestly I just can't be bothered. I will admit that I'm kind of lazy, so that might not be that way for everybody. But honestly, if I can take a shortcut I usually will, unless it's creating functionality that I find fun

AI: That's honest and really useful - the balance between learning, what you find engaging, and just practical efficiency. 

You mentioned functionality that you find "fun." Can you give me an example of something you'd choose to tackle yourself because you enjoy it, versus something you'd readily hand off to AI?

User: Off the top of my head it's hard to think of a specific example. Things like building out user interactions in React or writing a from scratch server side pagination implementation, I think I'd like to build it myself.

AI: That's helpful - those more creative, interactive pieces versus the repetitive testing work.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I delegate the entire task usually but then work through the bugs with it.

AI: So it's more like: "Here's what I need done" and then you work together to fix whatever issues come up.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I'd say it's fairly neutral. It's somewhat encouraged, but at the same time, certain AI models are blocked, so that's a bit annoying.

AI: Tell me more about that - which models are blocked and how does that affect your workflow?

User: I don't know all of the ones that are blocked. They want us to use Copilot, but I find it to be inferior for many takss.

AI: That's interesting that your company pushes one tool but you find others work better for certain tasks.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Most of the times I've tried to use copilot at work, I've been fairly unhappy with it, honestly. I don't really bother to use it anymore. I just felt like it was giving lackluster answers/usually gave bad/buggy code.

AI: That sounds frustrating - being pushed to use a tool that doesn't meet your standards, especially when you know there are better alternatives available.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI (even if it wasn't at work due to the restrictions) made you feel particularly satisfied with the outcome?

User: Yes, any time that it's able to nail a task on the first try is honestly very nice.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I worry about AI taking over quite a lot, but its aptitude for certain areas does make me feel like not being good at those areas maybe doesn't matter too much. Does it really matter that I'm not very good at writing Jest tests when I can just have an AI model do them? I'm not sure.

AI: That tension you're describing is really interesting - both worrying about AI taking over but also questioning whether certain skills still matter if AI can handle them well.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I don't see AI taking over completely, because even when well prompted by a software engineer, it's still a miss sometimes. I think you'll have far worse results if you have non-technical users prompting for technical implementations. With that said, I feel like it's here to stay and working with AI to get through issues will become a skill that is needed. I think refusing to use AI is hamstringing yourself.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - AI as a tool that requires skill to use effectively, especially in technical contexts.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful thoughts about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest take on the balance between learning, efficiency, and the reality of workplace restrictions on AI tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think I have anything else that comes to mind at the moment.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI at work - from the workplace restrictions to the verification processes you've developed to catch AI mistakes - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty about both the benefits and frustrations you've experienced. Have a great rest of your day!
