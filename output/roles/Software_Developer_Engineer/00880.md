Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, I don't think. Happy to get started!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a dialogue/conversation designer, for a company that provides AI-powered voice assistants in enterprise/business use cases. I use AI in lots of ways, pretty much in every step of the chain, from getting help in turning information on a client's website into the kind of conversational prose an AI voice assistant could give a customer over the phone, to helping me analyse data in call reviews. I also write code in python to use with our in-house AI agent builder - but it also relies on LLM calls to call the python. So i use AI to help me debug and refactor prompts, too.

AI: That's fascinating - you're working in such a layered AI environment. It sounds like you're using AI to build AI, in a sense.

When you mention turning client website information into conversational prose, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like? How do you and the AI work together on that specific task?

User: Well, it depends on the project and what the client gives us to begin with, but usually a client will just provide a document - perhaps an excel spreadsheet with all the troubleshooting and FAQ info that their (live human) agents would provide over the phone. While other times we might be given nothing more than the URL to the client's website, and be expected to start with the available content (FAQs, troubleshooting info) that's provided there. The next step is turning that into more conversational (and brief) prose that would sound good being read out over the phone. Long paragraphs and dense chunks of information need to be broken up into shorter steps. So i might possibly just give AI (Chat GPT or Claude) the pasted text from the website or the excel doc, and ask it to break it up and make it more conversational. Although i'd probably write one or two examples of my own first, and then ask the AI to replicate that tone and style for the rest. Does that make sense?

AI: That makes perfect sense - you're essentially training the AI on your specific style first before letting it handle the bulk of the work. 

Tell me more about that decision to write one or two examples yourself first. What drives that choice? What happens differently when you provide those examples versus when you don't?

User: Well, our voice agents are quite natural and conversational - the idea is for them to sound like customer service agents. And lets say ChatGPT for instance has it's own "tone" and its own quirks and habits - numbered lists, etc. It's much easier for me to set the style and tone myself - taking one or two chunks of text and then breaking them down and rewriting in conversational language and then asking the AI to match to that style - I think that's where AI shines, when it has a more clearly defined task and something to emulate or work towards.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - using AI's strength in pattern matching rather than letting it default to its own style preferences.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your workflow that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Well, I think that higher-level design - planning out a longer trouble shooting "flow" for example - while I'm sure that AI might be able to do a good job on that, i enjoy that work and also I feel like you need to have been a human being, with experience in talking to human agents on the phone, to be able to replicate that kind of user experience.

AI: That's really interesting - you mentioned both enjoying that work and feeling like it requires human experience. 

Can you tell me more about what it is about that higher-level design work that you find enjoyable? What's happening when you're planning out those troubleshooting flows that feels satisfying to you?

User: I suppose thinking about the most natural and seamless throughline - which questions, which pieces of information, etc, need to come first, in order to create the least friction and make the experience the best it can be for a user.

AI: That strategic thinking about user experience flow sounds like really meaningful work. 

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would always collaborate. I think that on some level I wouldn't fully trust it to see something through to completion. As i mentioned, I work a lot with AI - our voice agents are powered by AI - and they are often hallucinating or going "off the rails". I think the eagerness to help, to please, leads AI to try to fill in blanks rather than admit it can't do something. So i'd always want to check work - and the idea of having to comb over something *afterwards *seems more laborious and time-consuming somehow than incrementally working back and forth WITH AI on something and checking at each stage that it's still on track?

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - it sounds like you've developed a working style that leverages AI's strengths while accounting for its tendencies to overreach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that working in an AI-focused company shapes how you approach these tools?

User: Yeah, we are being encouraged to use AI as much as we can to increase productivity. The whole design team was recently bought a team ChatGPT pro subscription. The software engineers are encouraged to use Cursor. And there's a lot of in-house tools and encouragement from management to use it as much as we can.

AI: That sounds like a very AI-forward environment. With that kind of organizational push to use AI as much as possible, how do you personally navigate that? 

Do you find yourself using it more than you might otherwise, or does your collaborative approach I heard about earlier still guide how much and when you use it?

User: I think I would have used it the way i currently do to be honest - although at first i wasn't sure if it was okay (I.e. fully above board) to outsource some of the writing/rewriting tasks to AI. So to be given the greenlight on this has stopped me from worrying if it was what I should be doing.

AI: That's really helpful to understand - so the workplace culture gave you permission to do what felt natural, rather than fundamentally changing your approach.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can give you a frustrating example: I was debugging some code and an overarching prompt too. I worked for about an hour (this was actually today) with ChatGPT, and got to a point where the code was too complex for me to understand it and yet it wasn't working. We entered into a "loop" where ChatGPT kept insisting that it had solved the issue, but each time i tried it, the issue persisted, and in the end i scrapped it and went for a simpler approach, essentially wasting an hour.

AI: That sounds like a really frustrating loop to get stuck in - especially when you can feel the time ticking away. 

What was it about that situation that made you decide to finally step back and take the simpler approach? Was there a particular moment when you realized you needed to change course?

User: Apart from feeling like I'd already wasted an hour? I suppose just realising that I was trying to push to add a very small "quality of life" aspect when the simpler approach I originally had was working well enough already.

AI: That's a really honest reflection - recognizing when you're chasing diminishing returns versus accepting "good enough."

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well, i used to write full time for a living- and for a while I considered moving into software engineering. Both of these are skills which AI is getting very good at! I think these days, I have decided to write weirder stuff for fun and just chip away at programming too for my own personal pleasure, and now that I have a reasonably interesting full time job (which will most likely also be taken over by AI) I should just try to rediscover the pleasure in certain things in my spare time, rather than turning everything into a possible money-making opportunity.

AI: That's such a thoughtful way to approach it - separating the joy of doing something from its economic value. It sounds like you've made a conscious choice to preserve the intrinsic satisfaction in those skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that hopefully there will be a "sweet spot" - where AI is even better and really assists me in productivity. Less errors, quicker and more useful generations of larger amounts of text and code. But soon after that point, there will also be no need for *me *to be doing my job anymore!

AI: That's quite a perspective - seeing both the potential peak collaboration point and its own obsolescence coming after it. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner rather than delegating complete tasks, and how you've thoughtfully separated the joy of skills from their economic utility.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of at this time!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working collaboratively with AI, navigating that balance between productivity and maintaining control, and especially your perspective on finding joy in skills regardless of their economic future - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the satisfying and frustrating moments. That kind of honest reflection is exactly what helps us understand the real lived experience of working with these tools.

Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!

User: No problem at all. This was a pleasure. Cheers!

AI: Cheers! Take care!
