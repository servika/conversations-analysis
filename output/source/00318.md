Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Please go ahead.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in biotech/bioinformatics, more on the programming side of things. One of the more efficient and regular application of AI in my workflow is asking it to generate boilerplate code such as that of getting a scRNA integration pathway setup, or maybe asking it to generate a quick function to test for a specific functionality that I am curious to test. Other applications can be to replace search engine need- such as to quickly look up a command or syntax. So on a typical workday, it is more like using it intermittedly for short, mundane, or repetitive tasks, or to save time.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned using AI for boilerplate code and quick functions - when you're working on these programming tasks, how do you typically interact with the AI? 

Do you find yourself going back and forth with it to refine the code, or do you usually get what you need in one request and then work with it independently?

User: Yes, so for the most part, I do not use it directly within in actual environment. Rather, using it to quickly lookup some syntax or generate a function and copy paste as I need. Most interaction is through a web interface. This is because I want to be careful what to feed into AI- both for privacy and accuracy concerns. Moving to the next part of your question, I do go a bit back and forth with it; however, I also modify the code or use a lot of my own code. So yes, my style is back and forth, but I try to limit it.

AI: That makes sense - the privacy and accuracy concerns you mentioned are interesting. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes I mostly choose to not feed AI any private data even though it can probably help me with some aspects of data analysis. This is mostly when the data is either not published yet, or has sensitive information/PII.

AI: That's a clear boundary you've established around data privacy. 

Beyond the data privacy considerations, are there other types of programming or analysis tasks that you prefer to keep doing yourself? For instance, tasks where you feel it's important for you to maintain direct control or expertise?

User: I do feel that AI still is not quite accurate for bioinformatic tasks. It is getting good with regular computer science/programming side, however, some of the lesser known or smaller bioinformatic tools are not its strength. Hence when working on some of the more specialized, niche stuff, it is important to maintain control.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the difference between general programming tasks where AI performs well versus the more specialized bioinformatics domain knowledge where it's less reliable.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has developed any shared practices or boundaries around AI use?

User: I think it is generally well understood across the board to not use AI with sensitive data. Hence, most of the application of AI from my team is limited to getting help with regular old 'programming' and just quickly looking up stuff. Everybody has their own style to use it, or how much they use it. Apart from that, the use case is broadly what I use it for.

AI: That shared understanding about sensitive data seems like a practical approach your team has developed.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI can more often than not feel frustrating, especially in my field. As we cannot provide it the context of the project, and its limitations in biotech tools- it can often generate faulty responses and inaccurate information. For instance, I asked it about a particular tool, and to generate a small program to utilize its application; however, the responses it provided were quite off- hallucinating I would say. Even after going back and forth with it to no avail, I myself read the whole documentation of the tool in order to apply it.

AI: That sounds like a really frustrating experience - spending time going back and forth only to have to read the documentation yourself anyway. 

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying or helpful? What made that interaction work well for you?

User: Yes AI can be very helpful in asking it about documentation of some of the well known tools. For instance, I did not want to go through the whole, vast documentation of a particular library, and even searching through it was a pain because of mis-arranged topics and partitions. In this, I can usually explain the AI what I am looking for, like a function similar to this one, but that does this with a different data type, and it can yield me a useful result quickly.

AI: That's a great example of where AI really shines - helping you navigate through complex documentation efficiently. It sounds like it works well when you can describe what you're looking for conceptually.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I definitely think that AI can basically take over most of the rut work. However, it would be like mathematicians getting a calculator and they moved ahead to solve other math without worrying about arithmetic operations. In a similar way, I occasionally refresh how to do something manually, but I also have more work to get to.

AI: That's a really thoughtful analogy with mathematicians and calculators - freeing you up to work on higher-level problems while AI handles the routine operations.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see your usage patterns changing as the technology improves or as your field adapts?

User: I think it could be quite interesting because the data we deal with is sensitive. Hence, usage of AI in a completely integrated aspect would be difficult to envision unless better they develop or tie-up with a special closed model. Hence even for the workers, the chance of increasing the extent of relationship is quite limited until then.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI works well for general programming tasks but struggles with specialized bioinformatics tools, and your calculator analogy for how it frees you up for higher-level work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced ways AI fits into specialized technical work - from the privacy constraints to the domain-specific limitations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
