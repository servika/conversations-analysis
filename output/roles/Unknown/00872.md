Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I don't have any questions at this stage

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for several types of tasks. Mainly, I use it to help me generate creative ideas. For example, if I need to come up with an innovative and efficient copy for an outreach campaign, I will ask AI to generate an email for me using a very specific framework.
I also use AI to perform a quick data analysis when needed, giving it data and asking for specific insights.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI for both creative and analytical work. 

When you mention using AI for creative ideas like that outreach campaign copy, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like? How do you typically interact with the AI to get from your initial need to that final email copy?

User: I usually choose a framework that I want to use for the email, depending on whether I'm chasing conversion or engagement. Then, I tell the model the framework I want to use along with the arguments I want to use, to generate the email in a few variations. Finally, I modify the email manually until I'm fully happy with it.

AI: That's a really detailed process - it sounds like you have a pretty structured approach. 

I'm curious about that final step where you modify the email manually until you're fully happy with it. What kinds of changes do you typically find yourself making to the AI-generated versions? What is it that makes you feel the need to adjust them rather than using them as-is?

User: It's usually changes that make the email feel human-written instead of AI-written. Those are usually subtle changes like changing to fancy word to a more casual one, and removing the em dashes.

AI: That's a fascinating insight - you're essentially "humanizing" the AI output. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you're comfortable delegating to AI?

User: The tasks I handle myself, apart from the final touches like that, are anything related to planning. I need to make sure it's perfect because it's my added value, and I plan every campaign and strategy myself without AI.

AI: That's really telling - planning as your added value. 

When you say you need to make sure the planning is "perfect" because it's your added value, can you tell me more about what goes into that planning work that feels uniquely yours? What is it about planning that makes it feel different from the creative copy generation?

User: The planning involves the execution of the campaign in a proven manner, but it also needs to adapt to our specific needs. It's easier for me to adapt our strategy to the current needs directly rather than describing everything in depth to a model and not being sure that the output will be satisfactory

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like there's this element of contextual nuance and real-time adaptation that feels more efficient for you to handle directly.

When you do use AI for work, like with those email campaigns or data analysis, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate, I don;t delegate completely

AI: Tell me more about what that collaboration looks like in practice. When you're working on something like that email campaign, how does that back-and-forth actually unfold?

User: It unfolds very naturally, I enter a prompt and then the model gives me a result, which I will modify slightly with new prompts until I'm happy

AI: That iterative process sounds quite fluid. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the environment you work in shaped your approach at all?

User: Not really, I've trained myself directly

AI: Interesting that you've developed your approach independently. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It made me very satisfied one time where I needed to generate a very specific email campaign for a client. I spent time entering a complex prompt, and the result was perfect

AI: That sounds like a great moment - when everything clicked. 

What made that particular result feel "perfect" to you? Was it that it needed fewer of those manual adjustments you mentioned earlier, or something else about the output?

User: Yes, I needed very few changes, and it really followed my instructions

AI: That's a powerful experience when the AI truly gets what you're asking for. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No, I think that using AI will be the new skill, but it won't take over my work

AI: That's an interesting perspective - AI as a skill to develop rather than a replacement threat.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future than you do now?

User: Probably, but it's hard to say as I don't know how AI will evolve

AI: That's a fair point - it's hard to predict something that's changing so rapidly.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on planning being your unique added value and how you've developed this collaborative, iterative approach to working with AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing special, thanks for your questions, it was very interesting

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that collaborative, iterative process and how you think about AI as a new skill rather than a replacement have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your approach with me today. Have a great rest of your day!
