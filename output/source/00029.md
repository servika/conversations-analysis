Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project that I took part of was determing the proper use case for 3D printed materials in high temperature environments. I started by looking at a large range of filaments able to be 3D printed, sorted them based on characteristics like glass transition temperature and heat deflection temperature, and then used several of the higher strength filaments for different use cases, testing them for strength along the way

AI: That sounds like a really systematic approach to materials testing. Tell me more about how you went about testing these filaments for strength - what did that testing process involve?

User: The testing process involved following outlined international standrds that filament providers used to test their filaments. This means all samples were printed at 100% infill, and were then subjected to tests at room temperature, and then dfifernet sets of tests at elevated temperatures.

AI: Interesting - so you were following established international standards to ensure your results would be comparable to what the filament providers were reporting. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? This could be at any stage - from the initial research and sorting phase, during the testing, or in analyzing your results.

User: I primarily used AI tools in the initial research and sorting phase. I would find amterial data sheets for various filaments and have AI go through all of these documents, and select filaments that had material properties above or below limits that I had set. After this, I would also use AI to form a list of all the available filaments that met the standards I had set, and would ask it if I was misssing any. From there, I would get Ai to sort the filaments based on different properities that each one had

AI: That's a really practical application - using AI to process and sort through all those material data sheets sounds like it could save significant time. 

For that initial research and sorting phase, tell me about how you decided to use AI for those tasks versus doing it manually. What made you think AI would be a good fit for that particular work?

User: I thought AI would be a good fit because it's able to sort through information a lot faster than me. I was able to use it instead of having to go through every material data sheet individually. I find AI is also good at presenting information it finds in clear formats.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the speed and formatting advantages sound really valuable when you're dealing with multiple data sheets.

Thinking about the other parts of your research - the actual printing, the physical testing, analyzing the test results - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: As far as printing and physical testing, AI is still unable to do either one of these things. For analyzing test results, I thought that the results were to important, and that I should do it myself, because AI tools can occasionally hallucinate analysis to give the user what the model thinks it wants.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - the concern about AI potentially hallucinating analysis, especially when the results are critical. 

When you were using AI for the initial research and sorting phase, how did you verify or validate what it produced? How did you make sure it hadn't missed important filaments or misinterpreted the material properties?

User: I would do a control F through random material documents, spot checking the data that the AI had provided me with to ensure that it matched the material documents.

AI: That spot-checking approach sounds like a good verification strategy. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would want it to be better at knowing what information that it finds online is real or not

AI: That's a really insightful point - being able to better distinguish reliable information from unreliable sources would be incredibly valuable for research.

Tell me more about that challenge. Have you run into situations where AI has pulled information that turned out to be questionable or inaccurate when you were doing your material research?

User: Yes, sometimes AI would take what was said about a filament on a forum like Reddit as actual fact, and give me false information. For example, it said a filament would melt at a much higher temperature than it actually would.

AI: That's a perfect example of why source reliability is so critical in research. Getting false melting point data could have really impacted your testing decisions.

Those are all my main questions - your perspective on using AI for the data processing while being cautious about analysis due to hallucination risks was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the trade-offs between AI's efficiency in processing data sheets versus the need for careful verification and your decision to handle critical analysis yourself really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

The example you shared about AI picking up incorrect information from forums like Reddit perfectly illustrates the source reliability challenges that researchers face when using these tools.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
