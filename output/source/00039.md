Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yes sounds good, lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: one recent research project that I worked on had to do with making glasses using Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) on 1x1 cm silicon thin films. The thin films were then annealed and then analyzed with a variety of methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), polaroid optical microscopy for images, and also Raman Spectroscopy. Our goals was to find out how different polymorphs on the material would form. I worked primarily on the data analysis part of this project.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project! The combination of PVD, annealing, and multiple characterization techniques must generate quite a bit of complex data to work through.

Tell me more about what that data analysis work involved - what were the main steps you had to take to go from your raw AFM, optical microscopy, and Raman data to understanding the polymorph formation?

User: Yes I mostly focused on analyzing the Raman spectroscopy data. On the thin film, we took Raman readings of various points plotted by a coordinate system. Then I analyzed each spectrum and created a variety of heatmaps that were able to distinguish the different polymorphed based on this data. I accomplished this using python, pandas, and seaborn

AI: That's really interesting - using coordinate-mapped Raman data to create heatmaps that can distinguish polymorphs sounds like sophisticated analysis work. Python with pandas and seaborn is a great toolkit for that kind of spatial data visualization.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? Whether it was in the spectral analysis, the heatmap generation, or any other part of your workflow?

User: Yes I did use AI tools first as part of my research to better understand this topic, specifically the concepts of PVD and the details on glass and crystalline states of matter. Then in addition I also used AI tools to help code and refine the data analysis for me.

AI: That's really helpful to know you used AI in both the research and coding phases. Let me focus on one of those areas first.

For the coding and data analysis refinement part - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus figuring things out through documentation, Stack Overflow, or other traditional programming resources you might normally turn to.

User: Yes I decided to use AI as I think it would be quicker and get me the answer faster, whereas in Stack Overflow I have to look things up, read through the responses, and figure out how to apply these things to my code.

AI: That makes sense - the speed and directness of getting tailored help for your specific code situation sounds appealing compared to hunting through forums.

When you were using AI for that coding help, how did you go about verifying that the code suggestions or refinements it gave you were actually working correctly for your Raman analysis?

User: Yes well I read through the code and made sure it did what it was supposed to. I also already had a brief understanding of what the data visualization would look like, so I made sure it matched in that way.

AI: That's a smart approach - using your domain knowledge about what the visualization should look like as a check. 

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI yet - like maybe the AFM analysis, or the optical microscopy work, or even the experimental design itself - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I mean I just didn't see the need for AI in these parts yet. Like for example when I do optical microscopy, it is just me loading each sample into the microscope and taking images of the film while it anneals.

AI: That makes perfect sense - when it's hands-on experimental work like loading samples and capturing images, AI wouldn't really fit into that physical process.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask about something a bit more forward-looking: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Probably more in depth knowledge of scientific topics. I think AI currently does already a good job of overview topics, but I wouldn't really trust it for more specific and complex research problems. Instead, for these I would still rely on myself to look at research papers for information and guidance.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the depth versus breadth trade-off. It sounds like there's a trust threshold where you feel comfortable using AI for general understanding but still need to go to primary literature for the complex, specific details that really matter for your research decisions.

Tell me more about what would need to change for you to feel comfortable trusting AI with those more complex, specific research problems.

User: Well because right now I have seen many instances of AI halluncinating information when it doesn't know something. So I would probably have to see sources for where it would get its information from and also more studies to show that AI is performing in such problems.

AI: That's a really important concern - the hallucination issue is definitely something that would make anyone cautious about relying on AI for critical research details. The need for transparency about sources and validation through studies makes a lot of sense.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI for speed and efficiency while being appropriately cautious about trust and verification were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no that is it

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can be valuable for speed and initial understanding, but how the hallucination issue creates important boundaries around where you're comfortable using it, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

I appreciate you taking the time to walk me through both your polymorph analysis project and your thoughtful approach to integrating AI tools where they add value while maintaining the rigor your research demands. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again for your time today!
