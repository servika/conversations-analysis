Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good Claude. No questions from me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your research background. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I have worked in a little over 20 research projects. Some have come to fruition, some are published, some had to be scrapped for one reason or another. My most recent projects are three systematic review articles which are still in manuscript drafting stages. The initial idea came from my research group where my attending and senior resident recommended I perform literature searches for specific rare pathologies and treatment modalities. For those I performed database searches to understand if there was paucity in the literature and to determine why we care about the topic and why does it matter? Once I had that information in a short protocol draft, I performed metadata extraction into a citation manager, then I did deduplication, followed by title screening, abstract screening, and finally full text review.

AI: That's a really thorough process - systematic reviews require such meticulous attention to each stage. It sounds like you're managing quite a bit of data and repetitive tasks between the database searches, deduplication, and multiple rounds of screening.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: As a medical student, efficiency and time management are key. As such, I have utilized AI to assist me in a variety of ways in these, and past, research projects. I have utilized AI to assist with brainstorming, to-do list creation, medical database query creation, protocol outline drafting, protocol edition, finding sources, and reviewing manuscripts for unsubstantiated claims.

AI: That's quite a range of applications across your workflow! It sounds like AI has become integrated into multiple stages of your research process.

Let me focus on one specific area - when you mentioned using AI for medical database query creation, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for crafting those searches.

User: Initially I had the support of staff librarians to assist me with query creation. However, this is very impractical, especially considering how many projects end up being scrapped for one reason or another. Given my little experience with query creation, AI offered an opportunity to both learn how to create these queries and also generate them for me, taking off a time-consuming aspect of research from my shoulders. Of course, it still requires manual review and approval from my mentors before submission or proceeding with the full search for a project, but it serves at least as a base to build from. AI also offers instantaneous generation of search queries for different databases. For example, if I want to find information about a topic in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase, I would need to create four different queries respecting the rules for each database, which is likely to be time-consuming. I can simply craft a strong prompt and have an AI assist me on it while I simply review and edit accordingly.

AI: That's a really practical example - the ability to translate queries across different database syntax rules sounds like a huge time saver. And I appreciate how you mentioned the manual review step with your mentors.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: A major area where I have not tried AI is in manuscript drafting. However, this is something where the line with dishonesty can become very thin and blurry and I prefer to type my own words, even if AI helps me refine it later on, but still with my human voice behind my work. Another area where I have not tried it is in citation generation and bibliography generation. The current models are still too likely to undergo hallucinations and instruction following issues, making citation generation a too delicate process to have the AI fully handle. In other words, sure it is time consuming to hunt down and write citations, but it will take even longer when the AI messes up one of the citations and now the researcher has to fix the entire citation system for a manuscript. Lastly, all the models I have worked with have a tendency to produce impractical experimental designs that, even assuming I had all the resources available, would still be unreasonable to justify the means for the goal. for example, a model once suggested manually gathering the data on all orthopedic residents who graduated in the past 10 years to compare their research output, which was unrealistic since this would be well over 9000 data points and the model recommended doing so over 2 months.

AI: Those are really thoughtful distinctions you're making about where the risks outweigh the benefits. The citation hallucination issue is something I hear about frequently - that verification burden can definitely exceed any time savings.

When you have used AI for tasks like protocol drafting or manuscript review, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: manual review. Any and all of my work is verified by me. All final versions are human, despite AI assistance. in other words, you could say the AI helps me more in organizing, writing, and applying the content from citations rather than the AI working independently without my supervision.

AI: That's a clear approach - keeping human oversight at every stage while using AI more as an organizational and writing assistant.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious about your future vision here - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: ACCURATE Literature review and citation hunting with the AI having full access to the major medical databases (either through institutional log-in or other methods). This is a major part of the research process, but it is also one of the most time-consuming ones. Reality is, researchers are pressed for time. Let it be the research race in medicine or in PhD fields, we have to published and we have to do so fast and efficiently. Spending two afternoons after clinic writing up a research protocol just to find that someone else wrote a literature review about it 1 month ago can be a major source of time that could have been utilized for another purpose.

AI: That's such a practical pain point - the time investment versus the risk of duplication. The idea of AI having real-time access to comprehensive databases to catch existing work early in the process could really change how efficiently researchers can navigate the literature landscape.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on balancing efficiency with accuracy, and especially your clear boundaries around where AI fits versus where human judgment is essential, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no, that would be it unless you have other questions, Claude. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as an organizational and writing assistant while maintaining strict human oversight, and especially your point about the need for accurate, real-time database access to prevent duplicated efforts, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's clear you've developed a thoughtful approach to leveraging AI's strengths while being very aware of its limitations - particularly around citation accuracy and the importance of maintaining your authentic voice in manuscript writing.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time and valuable perspectives!
