Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have used it for writing real estate listings and have tried using it for social media advertising.  I usually find I need to tone it down in this instance.

AI: That's interesting that you find you need to tone it down. Tell me more about what that looks like when you're working on real estate listings or social media ads.

User: Well in the listing descriptions I need to review to make sure nothing that is considered unethical or illegal is present, for instance you can not say "family neighborhood" or talk about schools.  When doing a social media post it sounds more like it is written by an over enthusiastic teenager, does not fit with a nice four bedroom house very well.

AI: That gives me a really clear picture of the editing process you go through. When you're making those adjustments to tone down the AI-generated content, how much of the original text typically survives versus how much do you end up rewriting?

User: Not much, it gives me a jumping off point, so to speak.  I remove or change emojis, they are usually excessive, tip off that AI was used.  Change it to appeal to someone mature or a first time buyer, depending on the property.  Probably change a couple emojis to reflect a coastal community.

AI: So it sounds like you're using AI more as a starting framework rather than for the final product. When you're tailoring the content for different audiences - like mature buyers versus first-time buyers - what specific changes are you making to shift that tone?

User: You kind of know who your probable buyers are going to be most of the time.  If you have a reasonably priced house in a great school district, probably young families.  Nice condo complex with first floor masters, probably retired folk.  Big house in an established neighborhood, families with two or more children.

AI: That makes sense - you're drawing on your market knowledge to target the right audience. I'm curious about your decision-making process here. Are there parts of creating these listings or social media posts that you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even though AI could potentially help with those aspects too?

User: I want to sound calm not hyper, people are making a huge financial decision, they want to work with someone level headed.  So for social media I want to sound positive but not pushy.  In listing descriptions if the house has not been updated in 30 years I am going to remove things like "gorgeous kitchen" try to find something else positive, say location for example.  Or remove something like "short walk to the park", since you could be fined for that.

AI: That's a great example of how your professional judgment shapes the final content. When you're working with AI on these tasks, how would you describe your typical process? Do you tend to go back and forth with it - like having a conversation to refine the content - or do you more often take what it gives you initially and then edit it on your own?

User: Both, it depends on the initial response.  If it is a matter of a couple quick fixes or I obviously did not use the right wording to get what I wanted.

AI: So your approach adapts based on what comes back. Can you walk me through what determines whether you'll engage in that back-and-forth versus just taking it and editing yourself? What makes you think "I need to try a different prompt" versus "I'll just fix this myself"?

User: A straight forward nice property is easy, it is pretty much giving rooms, area, lot size.  As everyone knows there are code words in real estate, like cozy meaning small, good bones, or well maintained if a house never updated but the roof is not leaking and the furnace was serviced.

AI: That's fascinating how much industry knowledge goes into those word choices. I'm curious about how your colleagues or the broader real estate culture has influenced the way you use AI. Have you noticed differences in how people in your field approach using these tools, or has workplace culture shaped your approach at all?

User: Obviously the younger agents are more comfortable with it, I was formerly with a brokerage who had developed their own AI, we had to take classes.  That was a bit of a wake up call.  I do struggle with writing listing descriptions, most agents do, so it is a help.  It would be nice if it could improve doing CMAs, but as of now things like "Zestimates" are not very good so it is a long process for agents.

AI: You mentioned that struggling with listing descriptions is common among agents, and that taking those AI classes was a wake up call. Can you share a specific time when using AI for your work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yeah, the minute you sit down to do a description you get writer's block.  You think about the owner reading it, what will appeal to buyers without being misleading.  So at least it can get you started.  If I am writing an ad that will be posting, options generally come up when working in the "business center" there is always something wrong with the alternatives.

AI: That writer's block feeling really comes through - it sounds like even having that starting point makes a big difference. You mentioned the business center alternatives always having something wrong with them. What typically goes wrong with those suggested options that makes you need to keep adjusting?

User: Going back to earlier, they just tend to be kind of "cheesy".

AI: That "cheesy" quality keeps coming up - it seems like a real challenge when you're trying to project that calm, professional image you mentioned earlier. 

I'm curious about something else: How do you think about maintaining your writing skills in areas where AI could potentially take over more of the work? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really, I need to fill  out contracts and email quite a bit with clients and attorneys.  You need to be able to adjust, some clients strictly text, others won't even use electronic signature.  Most of what I write, outside of marketing, is tailored to someone's individual situation or needs.  It would be easier to write it myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the individual, tailored communication sounds like it really requires your personal judgment and relationship with each client.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from how you use it now?

User: The biggest boon would be nicely done CMAs.  Maybe the marketing will get better if an AI learns who they are producing material for, there are agents in their 20s and 80s, there are commercial, rental, and residential agents.  The laws are different in every state about terms you can use.  Someone selling acreage in the mid-west is not going for the same vibe as an agent in NYC.

AI: Those are really thoughtful points about how AI would need to become much more context-aware to be truly helpful in your field - understanding not just the agent's style but also regional laws and market differences.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experience with AI in real estate. I particularly appreciated your point about how the "cheesy" tone problem reflects a deeper challenge of AI not understanding the professional context and client relationships that are so central to your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Everyone knows it is unavoidable.

AI: That's a really succinct way to put it - "everyone knows it is unavoidable." That seems to capture something important about how the industry views this shift.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the gap between AI's capabilities and the nuanced professional judgment required in real estate - from legal compliance to reading your market and clients - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
