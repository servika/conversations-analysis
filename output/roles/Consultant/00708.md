Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am self-employed as a sales consultant and part-time content creator. I find I use AI less for the sales side of my job but use it frequently for content creation. I pull Chat GPT up at the beginning of every work day. Right now I'm using it most frequently to help me write an ebook, for organizing my thoughts and editing the copy. I also use it for opinions on design. I'm starting to use it more and more for social media strategy and content too - I'll often ask AI to help me come up with a visual hook, create captions, or tips on editing Reels to maximize the change of them going viral. I have been exploring using visual AI lately too, to help create photos and videos of [REDACTED] that I'm doing, but I'm having a lot less success using those features than traditional LLMs

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become a real cornerstone of your content creation process. You mentioned you use it less for the sales side of your work. 

What is it about those sales tasks that makes you lean away from using AI for them?

User: I consider myself an expert in the type of sales I do, whereas content creation is a new avenue for me. I use AI to gut check things I am learning or don't know myself, whereas in sales consulting I am the one doing the teaching and educating. I don't like using it to write emails, because I enjoy writing and want to sound like me

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a learning partner in your newer domain while maintaining your expertise and authentic voice in sales. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on content creation. Are there certain content tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to write copy myself for the same reason I like writing my own emails. I know I could outsource that to AI, but typically I ask AI to edit them or fact check, rather than writing the copy from scratch. It's important to me that I maintain my voice in all my work

AI: I can hear how important maintaining your authentic voice is to you across all your work. 

When you are using AI for content creation - like when you're working on your ebook or developing social media strategy - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I definitely collaborate, I hear a lot about "delegating" tasks to AI but I don't really know how to do that with what I do. Like I could say to AI - develop a content strategy for this niche and help me achieve XYZ, but I find it's never quite what I want so I end up collaborating anyway. I haven't found a way to successfully delegate my work load to AI

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like even when you try to delegate, you end up naturally falling into collaboration. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you're self-employed, how do you think about AI use compared to others in your field?

User: I can absolutely tell when other creators incorporate AI into their copy and to be honest I have mixed feelings about it. Without any edits, it seems really lazy.

AI: That's a really honest perspective. You mentioned having mixed feelings about seeing AI in others' work when it seems unedited.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would say it made me feel super satisfied when it helped me create my first video that went viral. AI gave me suggestions for how to best use visual/audio hooks and concise editing and the video reached over 300K people and is still growing in reach

AI: That's incredible - 300K people and still growing! That must have been such a rewarding validation of how you collaborated with AI on that project.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is, but I don't think what I do will be replaced by AI, just augmented by it. With sales, the personal touch and relationships are PARAMOUNT. AI can never replicate who I am or the way I make people feel heard, understood, and comfortable. With content creation, we're in an AI boon that has viewers craving authenticity and connection - many of them actively turn away from creators embracing AI. I enjoy using AI and learning about it because I don't want to fall behind on technology, and I understand it can help me in my careers, but I don't worry that AI will ever take over for what I do

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as augmentation rather than replacement, especially given how much authenticity matters in both your sales work and content creation.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope that my relationship with AI evolves as the technology does, particularly in the areas that are not my strengths. Like graphic design - I use Canva every day but I never formally studied design, so I find it really difficult to put together graphics and pdfs. AI hasn't gotten to a point where I'm comfortable with it designing things fully for me, or at least I don't know how to use it to that capability, but I'd love to as the technology continues to improve

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI to augment areas where you're learning versus maintaining your authentic voice in your areas of expertise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: It's interesting how AI isn't just growing linearly in a positive direction. For example, I've been using Chat GPT as my reliable LLM for a few years, but the latest release of Chat GPT 5 has me ready to cancel my subscription. The model seems actively worse for remembering things even within a single conversation, and I'm ready to look elsewhere. The implications of this are interesting to me, because at the end of the day, LLMs are just businesses and part of the capitalistic system. They exist to make money at this point, not to help humanity

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the non-linear nature of AI development and how business considerations can impact the user experience. It sounds like you've experienced firsthand how model updates don't always mean improvements for your specific use cases.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between collaboration and delegation, the importance of authenticity in an AI-augmented world, and how AI evolution affects real users will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
