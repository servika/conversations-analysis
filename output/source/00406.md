Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, and I have no questions at the moment

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have an online business where I sell print on demand products. I run this business on my own so I use AI on a day to day. Again because I am on my own in this I use it alot to bounce off ideas. I have ADHD and I find that it helps me get more focused on topics. Rather than me writing things down on my own. Even if I don't always use what the AI models tell me it still helps in the process. I also use it a lot when it comes to writing emails or messages to clients. Again my mind can get a bit scattered so for example,  I might send a draft of a work email to make sure I am not missing anything or I did not state the same thing twice. I also use AI when it comes to product research. This in particular made such a big difference because it cut the amount of time used up on research by a significant amount. Even when it comes to designs sometimes I'll use image generating tools just to get a better idea if what I have in mind will work aesthetically though I rarely do this.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves multiple functions for you, from helping with focus and organization to speeding up research. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that you don't always use what the AI models tell you, but it still helps in the process. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Making the designs that I put on my products. As mentioned before I might use AI as a form of brainstorming but I do not feel comfortable selling anything I did not make myself.

AI: That's a clear distinction you make between using AI for brainstorming versus the actual creative work you sell. 

When you use AI for the tasks you do delegate to it - like email drafts, research, or bouncing ideas around - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: Let's say I have an email I need to send. I always write a draft first rather than telling AI to create one on its own. I normally give AI a lot of information as if I was speaking with a friend or colleague and asking for their opinion on my work. So I will collaborate with it throughout a task.

AI: That collaborative approach you describe - treating AI like a colleague you're bouncing ideas off of - sounds like a natural fit for how your mind works, especially with the ADHD context you mentioned.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you're running this business on your own, have conversations with other entrepreneurs or people in your industry shaped how you think about using AI?

User: Before creating my own business I used to work at an office with many employees. We handled very important information and a mistake could cause serious consequences for our clients. Because of this it was encouraged to ask questions when we weren't sure on how to perform certain tasks. There was a strong sense of camaraderie in the office and an open line of communication between everyone. The type of place where it was normal to see employees moving constantly between their desks and other employees desks as they work to figure out their problems. I worked there for four years and was left with that habit. Now that I am on my own I use AI to imitate the way I would solve things in the office. Through learning about entrepreneurship and having an online store I came to learn about different AI tools. It started with tools such as Everbee, ChatGPT, and Leonardo AI. That quickly evolved into using a much larger range of tools.

AI: That makes so much sense - you've essentially recreated that collaborative problem-solving environment you had at your previous job, but now with AI as your colleague. It's fascinating how your workplace culture shaped your current approach to AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Early on in establishing my business finding tools that cut down the time I spent on other tasks was always extremely satisfying.

AI: Tell me more about that. What was one specific moment or tool that really stood out to you in terms of cutting down time? What was that experience like?

User: When it comes to doing product research I used to spend hours even days trying to see what products were selling and what other sellers where doing better. This was cut short by more than half the time using everbee

AI: That's a significant time savings! So going from days down to potentially hours of research time must have been a huge relief.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Because of how I use AI I don't see it as an issue. Don't get me wrong AI has huge advantages but it needs that human element. That's what makes it a great tool for someone to use but not to take over completely. At least not as it is now.

AI: That perspective about needing the human element is really thoughtful. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself continuing with this collaborative approach, or do you think it might change as the technology develops?

User: It might change as the technology develops but for the near future I see myself using it in the same way I have been using it until now.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've recreated that collaborative office environment you valued so much, now using AI as your sounding board and colleague.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, and how your previous workplace culture shaped your current approach, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
