Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions at this time. Let's get started!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in training & development in the organizational learning department of a large not-for-profit company.  I use AI to help accomplish a number of instructional design tasks. I regularly ask for assistance developing outlines for training sessions (both in person and virtual), coming up with memorable, catchy names for trainings, and developing activities for learner engagement. I also use AI to edit my work, as I don't always have someone to proofread documents or presentations for me. Less often, I use AI to generate content for slide decks or conduct more research on unfamiliar topics.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses across your instructional design work. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I tend to write learning objectives on my own, as those are often informed by key stakeholders and I need to ensure that they're written in a way that makes each objective specific and measurable, as well as directly related to the content (and participants) in a training session. 
I also handle slide deck design on my own as I prefer to have creative control, and honestly have not been impressed with the output when I've asked models to create PPTs for me in the past.

AI: That makes a lot of sense – it sounds like you keep control over the foundational elements and the visual presentation. When you do use AI for those tasks you mentioned earlier – like developing outlines or creating activities – could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am definitely more likely to collaborate. These tasks are essential to my role and I feel like I need to have a hand in them. I tend to use AI as a jumping off point and then again for edits and refinements after I've made the materials my own. For example, I might ask the model to generate multiple iterations of an outline, review all of my options, and then develop the final outline using a combination of my own knowledge, info. provided by stakeholders, and material suggested by the AI model. I then will present this finished outline to an AI model and ask it to chunk the content out into a slide by slide breakdown so that I can begin working on a slide deck. Once I'm done with a deck, I may go back to the AI and have it assess the flow of the content, determine whether all objectives were covered, assess the feasibility of the activities, and act as a copyeditor of sorts.

AI: That's a really thoughtful collaborative approach – using AI at multiple touchpoints while maintaining your expertise and judgment throughout. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace has been very slow to adopt AI and my direct manager does not see the value in it, but I have seen firsthand the benefits of using it in my work and will continue to do so. I have colleagues who are very interested in AI and have begun incorporating it to generate ideas. I am optimistic in the future AI will play in my workplace, as we begin to roll out technology like AI chatbots to assist workers.

AI: It sounds like you're somewhat of a pioneer in your organization, moving ahead despite mixed reception from leadership. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I struggled to create a training session on project management for a group that I had very little background information on. I provided an AI model the the job descriptions of the people who would be attending the training, along with some basic info. about their department and how it connects to the organization's goals and key initiatives. I was particularly satisfied with the training outline I asked it to develop, as well as the activities it suggested I incorporate into the training. Overall, this session was very well-received and got a 4.9/5 rating from participants. I felt like, without AI, I would have just kept second-guessing myself and spinning my gears, so to speak. In this case, AI really helped me settle on topics and activities and helped show me that they were relevant for my audience.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you break through that initial uncertainty and gain confidence in your approach. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about this, and this is part of why I take a more collaborative approach to working with AI. I know I can have a model quickly generate an entire training and all the corresponding materials, but I do not think the quality is (yet) at the level of materials designed by an experienced instructional designer. I also make it a point to stay up-to-date on changes and advances in my field and ensure my practices are based solidly on principles of andragogy, which AI models do not always consider first and foremost.

AI: That's a really strategic approach to staying grounded in your professional expertise while leveraging AI's capabilities. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think my relationship with AI at work will continue to evolve and expand. For example, I've recently started using AI models to generate inspiration for branding/logo design. While the images aren't up to my standards for these designs just yet, I've seen them improve and know that I'll soon be able to just prompt a model for a design that will be immediately usable. I also look forward to being able to replace stock photos used in trainings with quality, realistic AI generated images.

AI: Those are exciting possibilities, especially for creating more customized visual content for your trainings. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on taking that collaborative approach to maintain your professional expertise while still gaining AI's benefits, and how you're pioneering this in an organization that's been slower to adopt.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all I've got to say. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that collaborative approach to instructional design and how you're navigating being an early adopter in a more cautious organization will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
