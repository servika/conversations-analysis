Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no other questions. That sounds good!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To get us started, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: I have only just got back into scientific research so I am just starting to plan some projects, but haven;t completely any very recently. I have been working a more traditional job for the last 2 years. I could tell you about my most recent research project from 2-3 years ago if that would still be useful?

AI: Absolutely! A project from 2-3 years ago would be perfect for our conversation. It'll give us a good baseline to work with, and it's actually quite interesting timing since that was right when AI tools were starting to become more widely available to researchers.

Please, go ahead and walk me through that project - what was it about and how did the whole process unfold from start to finish?

User: I was researching how infectious diseases spread in agriculture. The disease I was particularly interested in was Zymoseptoria tritici infections of wheat. We ran a large-scale field experiment where we grew a field of wheat, allowed natrual infection of Z. tritici, recorded the extent of the disease in different phases and then used this data to improve models of the spread of this disease. I also in tandem with this project ran a purely theoretical research project where I was attempting to develop a spatially explicit crop disease model to test how different dispersal kernals impact disease spread.

AI: That sounds like fascinating research with both practical and theoretical components. I can imagine there were quite a few different stages involved - field work, data collection, analysis, modeling.

Where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools? I'm curious whether you tried them for any part of the field experiment data analysis, the theoretical modeling work, or perhaps somewhere else entirely.

User: The data we gathered was high-resolution images of diseased wheat leaves. I developed a machine learning, image segmentation program to automatically identify the proportion of a leaf that was infected and the number of pycnidia in infected patches. This obviously used AI, however, I coded the entire thing using online tutorials. I also coded my spatially-explicit model using online tutorials. However, this was due to my ignorance of the power of AI tools at the time. Looking back, the whole process would have been a lot quicker with AI tools. I also wish I had AI tools to help me with literature reviews before I planned these projects. However, with this project I don't think I actually used any AI assistants due to my ignorance of them at the time.

AI: That's really insightful - so you were essentially building AI-powered tools yourself through machine learning for the image analysis, but didn't have access to or awareness of AI assistants that could have helped with the coding process or literature reviews.

Since you mentioned that looking back, the whole process would have been quicker with AI tools, I'm curious: for that image segmentation work where you coded everything using online tutorials, how do you think you would approach that same task differently today with the AI tools you're now aware of?

User: I would definitely not use online tutorials to code and I would use exclusively AI tools to help me code my image segmentation program and my spacially explicit model. I believe this would have saved me weeks of work and would have helped me to focus more on actually answering research questions rather than fiddling with technical errors.

AI: That's a significant time savings you're describing - weeks of work! It sounds like the technical implementation became a major bottleneck that kept you from the actual research questions.

Now that you're getting back into research and planning new projects, tell me about how you're deciding when to use AI tools versus more traditional approaches. What's your thought process when you're faced with a task and weighing whether to bring AI into it or not?

User: AI is invaluable for me in the planning stage of my projects and has made me feel more positive about doing research than before. I use it to get a "state of the field" literature review when I am considering a research avenue and to help me identify gaps in knowledge in existing fields of research. In the past this required pain-staking and meticulous work to synthesise research across fields and identify the individuals and groups studying a subject I was interested in as well as the gaps in the cutting edge research at the moment. I think the likelihood that you could be working on a project that already had a publication was higher before AI tools also as it was harder to find publications simply using google scholar or equivalents. I experienced this when I was working on my spatially explicit disease model, we'd been working for a few weeks on it before my supervisor stumbled across an old paper that had looked at exactly what I was researching, meaning we'd wasted a few weeks of work. I think the use of AI tools now enables researchers to focus on building hypotheses, planning experiments, interpretting results and writing papers rather than the admin of sifting through literature which I personally never enjoyed. However, some current tools can make errors when providing citations so I always need to double check. I am still dubious of existing tools' capabilities for data interpretation and hypothesis building too and I enjoy this process as a researcher.

AI: This is really fascinating - you're describing AI as transforming one of the most time-consuming but less enjoyable parts of research, while you still want to maintain control over the creative and analytical aspects you find rewarding.

You mentioned being dubious about AI's capabilities for data interpretation and hypothesis building. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you hesitant to use AI for those tasks? What is it about those processes that makes you want to keep them in your own hands?

User: I am hesitant because I have seen AI tools make errors with mathematics in the past and sometimes AI tools aren't as good when working with novel questions and information. I also think that interpretting data is a relatively quick task that is fun for a researcher so there is no need to streamline this process often. Obviously there are some situations where AI tools can help, for instance if you have a massively large amount of data and need to repetitively process each data point in some way, AI tools can help to automate and streamline processes such as these. However, when it comes to key figures and interpretting what they mean for disproving/proving a hypothesis I think that this should be done by a researcher.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing a clear distinction between the automatable, repetitive processing versus the core intellectual work of hypothesis testing that defines research.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like that data interpretation and hypothesis building you just mentioned - what else has kept you from trying AI tools in other areas of your work?

User: Hypothesis building again is firstly a fun process that I enjoy. I also think researchers are better at hypothesis building at the moment as they can think more creatively about an unknown biological mechanism. When it comes to planning expriments, I think this is good when it is done in collaboration with an AI tool, but never solely by an AI tool. AI tools can still make silly mistakes and experiments have to be water tight and exact so it is best when an AI tool can give a template or outline of a plan for an experiment and then the researcher can check through everything and add details. Also as a researcher you want to know exactly what is going on in you project which you lose track of if you don't plan it yourself.

AI: That's a great point about maintaining ownership and understanding of your own work - that if you're not involved in the planning, you lose that intimate knowledge of what's actually happening.

Since you've been getting back into research and have this new perspective on AI tools, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't do well enough, what would that be and why?

User: It would be an improvement in the ability for AI tools to provide up-to-date, accurate citations in literature reviews to help me get the best understanding of current research landscapes as possible. At the moment, some tools still make citation errors and hallucinations which make you distrust every response and have to go through and verify every citation. If I could rely 100% on citations this would be a game changer for me personally.

AI: That's such a concrete and impactful wish - eliminating that verification step would remove a major friction point that currently limits how much you can rely on AI for literature reviews.

Those are all my questions for today. Your perspectives on how AI can enhance the administrative side of research while preserving the creative and analytical work that makes research fulfilling were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can transform the literature review process while researchers maintain control over the creative hypothesis-building really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you drew between streamlining the administrative tasks versus preserving the intellectually rewarding aspects of research was especially valuable.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
