Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical workday, I use AI quite a bit. I use it to craft direct messages to staff, improve the clarity/tone of messages/emails, create social media captions, brainstorm programs, and writing assistance.

AI: That's a nice range of uses. When you mention using AI to craft direct messages to staff and improve the tone of emails, what draws you to use AI for those communication tasks specifically?

User: When writing messages, sometimes it is hard to keep frustration or annoyance out of a message. While I have learned to do this more over the years, having AI to help proofread and rewrite to ensure messages are nice, concise, and easy to understand is extremely helpful and helps save time. Additionally, it is nice to have a tool that helps me realize where my messages are lacking details or essential information.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI serves as both an emotional filter and a clarity check for your communications. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When I am creating tutorials and procedural documents I prefer to do them on my own because I don't want to risk having any information about my place of employment, other individuals, sensitive information, etc. in a repository. If I do seek assistance, which is rare for these materials, it is usually in regards to proofreading. In these instances, I  alter my documents to create fictitious people and places before seeing help. By the time I make all the changes to prevent information from getting out, and then adjust to add the accurate information, it is usually quicker for me to just complete the work on my own.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the security considerations really do add layers of complexity that can outweigh the potential benefits. It sounds like the effort to sanitize the information ends up being more work than just doing it yourself.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate. I will share my thoughts or goals and a draft of where I am so far in my work. I then go back and forth collaborating on the task until I have everything the way I want it.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds quite interactive. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I have a lot on my plate any given day. My colleagues have influenced how I utilize AI when it comes to messages and brainstorming. When we are in working meetings, my colleagues will utilize AI to help brainstorm or accomplish meeting goals. At first, I didn't utilize AI and thought it was silly. It wasn't until I saw how much time it saves when helping with messages and brainstorming that I finally started to use it. As for workplace culture we have to constantly think of the needs of our customers and come up with new ways to engage them. Having AI to help brainstorm has reduced time in brainstorming sessions and helped free up time for other tasks.

AI: It's interesting how seeing your colleagues use AI in real-time during meetings helped change your perspective from thinking it was "silly" to recognizing its practical value.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. I was trying to create an email to turn down a request, but I wanted to do it in a way that didn't make the individual feel like I didn't want to work with them. I wanted the email to thank them for their passion and support. While it took a bit to get the perfect email, I was extremely happy with the end result because I was left with an email that was nice, while also rejecting their request.

AI: That sounds like a delicate communication challenge where you really needed to strike the right balance. It's great that the collaborative process helped you achieve that tone.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it is essential to maintain those skills. While AI is amazing, and definitely a great tool, it isn't perfect. You need to be able to confidently perform your duties. After all, you are getting paid to perform a service, and you need to have the education and skills to back up your position. AI can help you, for sure, but it can't get up in front of a room and present presentations and answer questions from a live audience in the moment. You need to know how to do everything, otherwise you shouldn't have the position to begin with.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the idea that AI enhances your capabilities but doesn't replace the fundamental expertise you need to do your job well, especially in those live, interactive moments.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision being able to use it more to assist with brainstorming ways to expand services beyond what I currently offer. Also, I envision being able to educate others on how to use it as a brainstorming tool.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as both an emotional filter for communications and your view that maintaining core skills is essential even when AI can assist.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the importance of security considerations, and how workplace culture can shift perspectives on AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
