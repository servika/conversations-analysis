Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, let's get started!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for a lot of creative tasks throughout the day and some more boring ones too. I love to word salad concepts and ideas into an ai and have it organize my thoughts to save time. This is especially helpful when planning large events and getting concepts together for clients. I use it to write emails a lot, so I don't waste time overthinking what I'm trying to say. I use it to handle tons of social media tasks like organizing content ideas for promos, advertising etc.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helps you in both the creative brainstorming phase and the execution side of things. 

When you mention "word salad concepts" into AI to organize your thoughts, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like? What does a typical interaction sound like when you're planning one of those large events?

User: I use the phrase word salad because I start typing and don't stop or worry about making sense or grammar. Planning a show for a large event includes specific descriptions for the performer(s), options based on the venue (like if there is a pool or if this is a dry event or if we are bringing the tank). Clients like well written descriptions and set schedules so ai really comes in handy for that.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - just letting your thoughts flow without worrying about structure initially. It sounds like you're in event planning or entertainment production.

Tell me more about that moment when you hand off your raw thoughts to AI. What happens next in that process? Does the AI typically capture what you were trying to communicate, or do you find yourself going back and forth to refine it?

User: There is always some refining! Some ai are better than others at handling my word salads. It's definitely a challenge because I will describe a setup and then halfway through decide to change it, so the ai has to be able to pivot and get it right. I usually just say "organize this" and see what it spits out. I often have to make performer schedules that also fit the performer physical limits and adjust to the specific venue and other conflicts. It can get pretty complicated so it's some in depth stuff. I love how ai can point out options though when schedules get complicated

AI: That pivot mid-stream sounds like a real test of how well the AI can follow your thinking! 

You mentioned that some AIs are better than others at handling your word salads. What makes the difference for you? When an AI successfully navigates one of those mid-stream changes versus when it doesn't quite get it right, what are you noticing in those interactions?

User: The best ai are able to pivot and ignore the first ideas/instructions and focus on the changes, while some other ai's will include the first instructions and forget the second or jumble it all up. It's frustrating when that happens, but when an ai can keep up with my brain and help me accomplish complicated tasks more quickly, I can get back to other things. I usually swap to a different ai if stuff gets too jumbled because it's easier to start over sometimes with a different ai than deal wiith major corrections.

AI: That makes total sense - when the AI gets confused, it probably creates more work than it saves. The fact that you'll actually switch to a different AI rather than keep correcting shows how important that smooth collaboration is to your workflow.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: So when it comes to the more creative side of my work, I will use ai just to get my ideas flowing but will finish something like a character/performer background myself to keep it more original so my company stands out more from the competition. I feel like ai is great for brainstorming and generic low-level creative work, but it lacks the originality I look for when I write. It's important to me that my company/performances are unique and not generic and ai has so much recycled content.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI as a creative catalyst but maintaining your own voice for the final product. 

When you say AI "lacks the originality" you're looking for, can you give me an example of what that looks like? What happens when you read something AI has generated versus something you've crafted yourself that makes you feel that difference?

User: For one, ai tends to have a tone or a feel to it? The writing is distinct to me, and I can always tell when an ai has been used. It seems to follow so many of the same patterns in grammar. It honestly feels like a distinct dialect of English. Anyway, I really love the nuances of human writing. For business stuff, Ai is wonderful. Need a professional email? ai all the way, but when I'm printing backdrops or themed banners with quotes about the performers or performances, I always write them myself. Ai might have the full English dictionary, but it can't understand the way a word can make a sentence flow or halt, and it lacks the understanding to make the maximum impact for anything creative. Like when I write a new script for a performer, it has to be perfect. It needs just the right amount of details and the right amount of emphasis on words. Ai just isnt there yet. Maybe someday though!

AI: That's such a vivid way to describe it - AI as having its own "dialect of English." I can really hear your appreciation for those subtle language choices that create flow and emphasis.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern with those business tasks versus the creative ones? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Business tasks I try to finish as quickly as possible so it's usually a collaboration. Even a professional email needs tweaking so that it sounds just right to me, but I am a stickler for grammar, and choosing the right words is crucial. I usually "word salad" my emails to an ai and have ai write them. If the changes are minor, i just copy and paste and fix them myself in my email. If an ai does a bad job, I just abandon ship and move to another ai. I don't really trust ai to handle anything independently. I really don't care for the tone it has most of the time and feel the need to change things so often that I can't imagine trusting an ai with my inbox. I would LOVE to have an ai that could handle clients though but in my style of writing. That would be an absolute dream because I don't enjoy the back and forth with clients. I much prefer to just do the actual performing.

AI: That dream scenario you mentioned - having an AI that could handle client communications but in your writing style - that sounds like it would be a game changer for your workflow since you prefer the performing side.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself talking about AI use with others in your industry, or is it something you've mostly figured out on your own?

User: I talk with my team about using ai, but outside of that, no. I figured out how to use ai to my advantage myself. It definitely took some work figuring out how to use it effectively. The benefit of using ai for brainstorming and organizing my ideas for events and performances is invaluable. It saves so much time and makes it easy to get more work done.

AI: It sounds like that learning curve was worth it once you found your rhythm with it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Once, I asked for some jokes to add to a script for a pirate performer, and half of them didn't make any logical sense, and they weren't funny at all. That was frustrating but again I simply abandon ship and try another ai. I've also been insanely satisfied when giving it really complicated schedule issues. Once I definitely thought it was impossible to squeeze an extra set in, and ai was able to stagger 6 perfomers, plus two performance areas, plus different costume change windows, and avoid other overlapping performances by other companies. It was definitely something I couldn't have done on my own.

AI: Wow, that scheduling triumph sounds incredible - six performers, multiple areas, costume changes, and avoiding conflicts with other companies. That must have felt amazing when the AI cracked that puzzle!

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have jobs I would gladly hand over to ai if I could find a capable ai. As a performer, an ai can't ever take my job, but it can absolutely take over the admin tasks associated with the industry and hopefully do a better job than I can with it.

AI: That's such a clear perspective - embracing AI for the parts of your work that aren't your passion while knowing your core skills as a performer are uniquely yours.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am very much hoping an amazing assistant ai comes out who is able to handle booking gigs and clients. Since the performance industry is constantly changing, this will be a challenge. There are so many specific details that change an event entirely, and what makes an event not only feasible but also best designed to fit the client.  For now though,  I expect that i will continue the way I'm going with using ai to brainstorm, organize, schedule, and handle writing some of those business emails.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a creative catalyst while preserving your own voice for the final product, and that vivid description of AI having its own "dialect of English."

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered the bulk of it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced ways you've integrated AI into your event planning and performance work - from those "word salad" brainstorming sessions to the dream of finding an AI assistant that could handle client communications in your style - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really fascinating to hear how you've developed such a strategic approach to working with AI while maintaining the creative elements that make your work unique. Thanks again!
