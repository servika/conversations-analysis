Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's do it.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure. I've integrated use of AI assistants for certain tasks that come back on a regular basis such as brainstorming for ideas on social posts and hashtags, or writing descriptions of properties for sale (as part of real estate marketing). I also validate my marketing strategies and brainstorm with AI assistants prior to launching campaigns. I gather ideas for newsletters. I request help with drafting longer communications but still write all individual emails myself. I also use AI regularly to speed up translations because I work in a creative field in a bilingual context. I also use AI for internet research on various topics.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses across different aspects of your work. You mentioned that you draft longer communications with AI help but write individual emails yourself. What makes you draw that distinction between longer communications and individual emails?

User: Longer communications tend to be slightly less personalized. They are usually meant to be press releases, website updates or social communications intended for wider audiences. Client and colleague emails sound more authentic when written by humans, especially when recipients are already familiar with your style of writing and tone.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction about authenticity and personal relationships. You clearly have a thoughtful approach to when AI feels appropriate versus when the human touch matters more.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Beyond what we just discussed about emails, are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I usually create all my own visuals as I have not mastered using AI for creating visual content. The few times I've tried to create something using Canva's AI, the quality was subpar. I prefer to do it myself as it currently takes less time. I also perform all my own editing when I outsource written content to AI because this way I go over everything and can feel comfortable with the final result. When I read contracts, I sometimes ask for summaries but still prefer to go over them myself out of fear of AI hallucination when it comes to more sensitive material.

AI: That's really interesting - you mention both quality concerns with AI-generated visuals and trust concerns around sensitive materials like contracts. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach to editing AI-written content.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It really depends on the task. Sometimes I will come up with a list of ideas or rough draft and request for an AI assistant to help me develop the content. I consider this collaborative work. That's what happens most often. But other times, I will be in the middle of scheduling some social posts and I will upload my post and ask the assistant to provide hashtags. Other times I will share a whole email and ask for ideas on a catchy email subject line. Does that help?

AI: That absolutely helps - it sounds like you have a flexible approach that adapts to what the specific task needs. You're describing everything from true collaboration where you start together, to more targeted assistance for specific elements like hashtags or subject lines.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work mostly independently because my role as a marketing specialist for a real estate team really encompasses most of the creative work. From time to time I delegate tasks to the team's human assistants but in general I do most of it myself with help from AI assistants. I have a lot of freedom and flexibility in my role. All that really matters are the results. My colleagues have less creative tasks and I believe they use AI mainly for administrative help.

AI: It sounds like you have quite a bit of autonomy in how you approach your work, which gives you the freedom to experiment with AI in ways that make sense for your creative tasks.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I honestly can't recall a specific instance where AI made me particularly frustrated, but I can share with you a cautionary tale from another team at the agency. A real estate team was selling a property that was fully described by an AI assistant and there seems to have been no human oversight. When the property went online, people started visiting... But quickly they realized that the great school that was advertised as being in proximity was not even close. It was in a different municipality. Frustrated potential buyers brought it up and the realtors that posted the property were very embarrassed. Accountability in property descriptions is huge. The embarrassing story made it all the way to the evening news. Personally, I feel particularly satisfied when I get tasks done quicker with AI and have more time for research and learning during my work hours.

AI: That's a powerful cautionary tale about the importance of verification, especially when accuracy has real consequences. It really illustrates why you mentioned being careful with contracts and doing your own editing.

You mentioned feeling satisfied when AI helps you finish tasks quicker so you have more time for research and learning. That's an interesting way to think about the time AI frees up.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do. All the time. As I see AI assistants becoming better and better at writing, ads, strategy, visuals, translation... I realize that from the moment they're able to synthesize everything on their own, they will technically have the ability to replace me. But today by collaborating with AI, I still feel like I'm in the driver seat. Maybe the future is that of dual human/AI collabs where humas are the operators and AI is a means to an end. But together we can write and paint and make music. What I mean is that my ideas can come to life with a skilled AI much faster than without it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing yourself as the operator in a human-AI collaboration where your ideas can come to life faster. It sounds like you're embracing the partnership while staying conscious of the bigger picture.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that, as I master new AI tools I will continue to save time and produce even better results, which will ultimately bring more success. I would also love to automate certain things and possibly save even more time that way. My hope is that despite AI's increasing skills, human input will always be necessary and therefore, people with the knowledge and skills to collaborate efficiently with AI will continue to hold positions without being replaced.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the "operator" in the collaboration and how you think about maintaining that driver's seat role as AI capabilities evolve.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: The only thing we haven't covered would be the subject of intellectual property that I've wondered about. Especially in creative fields, when using AI. (privacy and intellectual property)

AI: That's a really important topic you've brought up. Could you tell me more about what specific concerns or questions you have around intellectual property when using AI in your creative work? What situations make you think about this most?

User: Well say, I share ideas with an AI that could potentially be very lucrative if developed, how would I know if the company behind the AI that helps me develop it would not have some claims to it?

AI: That's a really valid concern about ownership and protection of your ideas when you're collaborating with AI on potentially valuable concepts. 

Have you changed how you approach sharing ideas with AI because of these concerns, or is this more something you're aware of but still working through how to handle?

User: I'm definitely cautious and looking into it. Hope this helps :)

AI: It absolutely helps - thank you for bringing that up. The intellectual property question is clearly something that's on the minds of creative professionals using AI, and your caution around it makes a lot of sense.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from your collaborative approach to the real-world consequences of AI errors to these important questions about intellectual property will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your work while maintaining that critical human oversight.

User: Thanks Claude. Take care for now.

AI: Thank you so much! Take care, and best of luck with your work in real estate marketing. Your thoughtful approach to AI collaboration was really insightful to hear about.
