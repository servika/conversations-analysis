Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to help me design lesson plans for my students and fact check content information when I am unsure.

AI: That's helpful to know you're using it for lesson planning and fact-checking. 

Can you walk me through what that lesson planning process looks like when you involve AI? How do you typically work with it to create those plans?

User: I will tell it the topic that I intend to plan the lesson around and a general format for how I would like the lesson to go (cooperative, independent, exploration-based, etc.). I will then work on an outline of the content that should be covered and use that to narrow down my options.

AI: So you're providing the topic and format, then working together to develop the content outline. That's interesting.

When you say you use that outline to "narrow down your options" - what kinds of options are you choosing between at that point? What does that decision-making process look like for you?

User: AI will usually give me lesson ideas that are not appropriate for my classroom specifically, so I have to tweak them significantly before implementation. I will get a list of potential lesson ideas and then go back to AI to refine my own ideas. Often my ideas are based off of a suggestion from AI, but sometimes it's something that I have come up with myself.

AI: That's a really clear picture of how you're working together. It sounds like AI gives you a starting point, but you're doing significant adaptation work.

When you go back to AI to refine your own ideas - whether they originated from AI suggestions or from your own thinking - what does that refinement conversation typically involve?

User: It greatly depends on the lesson. Sometimes I want to include some sort of storyline or case study type content, so I will ask AI to generate a situation for me based on certain guidelines. Other times I will ask it to make a mock-up of a worksheet so that I can get design ideas. Usually I will just use it to generate practice problems since that is what it is best at.

AI: It sounds like you've really figured out what AI does well for your needs - especially with generating practice problems. 

You mentioned that AI often gives you lesson ideas that aren't appropriate for your specific classroom. What makes those suggestions inappropriate? What does AI typically miss about your classroom context?

User: AI often gives me suggestions that require specific materials or resources that are not accessible for my classroom. It will also give me lessons that aren't really applicable to my classroom due to a large diversity of learners. If I ask AI to adapt the lessons based on my available materials, the adaptations are often not realistic. In other words, it assumes that something works when it's not physically feasible in a public school classroom.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's a gap between what AI suggests and the practical realities of your classroom environment.

When AI makes these unrealistic adaptations, how do you handle that? Do you continue working with AI to try to get something more feasible, or do you tend to take over the adaptation process yourself at that point?

User: I usually step away from AI until I can come up with a solid foundation for an idea on my own. Once I have that, I might return to AI to iron out some details or come up with practice problems.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - stepping back to develop your own foundation first, then bringing AI back in for specific pieces.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I have tried using AI to create presentations or models, but they are usually full of mistakes. Similarly, I have moved away from using AI to create worksheets from scratch. the formatting tends to be so poorly done that I have to start it over myself anyway.

AI: So it sounds like when the output requires a lot of cleanup or starting over, you've learned it's more efficient to just handle it yourself from the beginning.

Beyond those formatting and accuracy issues, are there other types of tasks where you deliberately choose to work without AI? Tasks where maybe AI could help, but you prefer to keep them for yourself?

User: I do not use AI for grading, as I feel that it would infringe on privacy as well as an obligation for me to give students the respect of looking at their work and providing genuine feedback.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making about grading and feedback being something that requires your personal attention and respect for students.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you tend to have these back-and-forth conversations rather than just giving it one complete task. Is that accurate, or does it vary?

User: Yes, I have not found AI to be very helpful when working off of a single prompt, no matter how detailed I make it. It often misinterprets something or provides inaccurate information, so I find it to be more efficient to work in little chunks.

AI: That chunking approach makes a lot of sense given what you've described about accuracy issues.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other teachers at your school using it similarly, or do you see different approaches?

User: I have seen other teachers use it to write articles and worksheets from scratch. I avoid doing so as I think that students need to understand the difference between AI generated material and human creations, and they should be able to critically examine work accordingly. Some teachers refuse to use AI at all.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective about students needing to understand the difference between AI-generated and human-created material.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have found AI to be both most satisfying and most frustrating when I use it to create diagrams. Sometimes I have a specific image that I want to use for a presentation, but I can't find an example without a background or in the right orientation free online. AI can often create those quickly for me. However, it has been incapable of making accurate images that require any complexity and/or labeling, and it can be frustrating to try to generate those.

AI: That's such a perfect example of AI being both helpful and limiting in the same task area. The simple diagrams work well, but the complex labeled ones don't deliver.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you decide what to delegate and what to keep doing yourself?

User: I do not believe that AI could reasonably take over the duties of a public school teacher. It may help speed up some of the more time-consuming tasks, but it cannot engage with students in the same way as a person. A teacher has to create the content, but they also have to present it to a greatly diverse classroom of students and know each student deeply enough to support them. While AI could potentially collect data on students, it cannot assert authority in a way that engages students that may otherwise be off task. No matter how well AI could present content, there will be students who would rather sleep or engage with other distractions. Human connection and relationships are needed in order to genuinely reach these students and encourage them to learn.

AI: That's a really comprehensive view of what teaching truly involves beyond just content creation. The relationship and authority aspects you mention are fascinating.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll change how you use it, or does your current approach feel pretty settled?

User: I assume that I will use it more heavily as its capabilities increase, but I do not see the overall format of my interactions with it changing anytime soon.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the importance of students understanding the difference between AI-generated and human-created material, and how you've developed this iterative, chunked approach that works around AI's limitations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating the practical realities of classroom teaching with AI tools, and especially how you've thoughtfully drawn boundaries around things like grading and student relationships, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your approach with me today.
