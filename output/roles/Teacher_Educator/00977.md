Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Yep, I'm ready

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a teaching assistant at a university (for mathematics). One of my main responsibilities is holding class sections (called discussions) for the students, where I go over problems and techniques in a smaller setting compared to the lectures. My standard procedure is preparing worksheets which review the week's material, and this is where I use AI to help me out.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application. When you're preparing these worksheets, how exactly does AI help you with that process? Walk me through what that looks like.

User: So I usually have a rough idea of the topics covered in a given week (e.g. "sections 3.2 and 3.3 from the textbook"). There are textbook problems, but I don't want to just regurgitate modified versions of them, since then there'd be no real reason for a lot of students to come to discussions. I try to get AI to produce me new problems that would be appropriate for the topic, but not ones that are too similar to the ones in the text.

AI: Tell me more about how you guide the AI to create problems that hit that sweet spot - challenging enough to be worth attending discussion for, but still appropriate for the topic level.

User: Honestly, I do it in a pretty elementary way. I'll usually upload a pdf of the text and point out the relevant sections, then ask for problems that are of a similar level but not too difficult. Of course, I check over each of the problems myself to make sure. Occasionally it takes a couple retries for me to find one I'm happy with, and sometimes I tweak them a bit myself.

AI: That checking process you mentioned - what are you typically looking for when you review the AI-generated problems? What makes you decide a problem needs tweaking or another retry?

User: First of all, I make sure the problem is actually solvable using the techniques we've taught. Sometimes a problem seems reasonable, but until actually trying it, there's no way to know. If the problem might take too many "mental steps" so to speak, I'll break it up into parts (for instance, part a, b, c, etc.) so that students have "checkpoints" they can get to.

AI: That's really thoughtful - the idea of creating those checkpoints. Are there certain types of tasks in your work as a TA that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Well obviously the bots can't do the actual teaching (yet!), so things like leading discussion sections and also holding office hours are up to me. Also, I don't really trust them to grade anything, between students' messy handwriting and having to ensure rubric consistency.

AI: When you think about that worksheet creation process specifically, how would you describe your working relationship with the AI? Are you more collaborating back and forth throughout the task, or do you give it the assignment and then work independently on what it produces?

User: Collaborating back and forth sounds about right. I give it a starting point, and then take a look at what it produces, but oftentimes I'm not quite happy with the output and have to retry or tweak it a bit (as mentioned). I don't think AI is capable of doing it entirely on its own yet.

AI: How have your colleagues or the broader culture at your university influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about it with other TAs or faculty?

User: One of my professors actually started talking about how good AIs had gotten at math recently, and that's part of what made me give it a try. I actually hadn't used it at all before then (there's lots of talk online about AI hallucination, but in practice I find this is rarely an issue with math nowadays). I think it's a useful tool.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI for worksheet creation made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've tried at times in the past to get them to come up with solutions to the worksheets, but never to significant success. I think the AI doesn't have a good handle on what an appropriate level of a solution is, which is a little annoying. For instance, there's no sense in using Stokes' theorem to solve a problem when students haven't even learned polar coordinates.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I've thought of it. Ultimately, I feel that's the way progress is, and sometimes it leads to things like job loss. I think it'll be a while before that happens still, so I'm not too concerned.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops?

User: I think I'll mostly use it the same way. I'm also a graduate student (comes with being a TA, naturally), and my hope is that it'll get to the point where I might be able to use it as a research aid and solve advanced problems.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experience with AI in your teaching work. I particularly appreciated how you described that collaborative back-and-forth process with worksheet creation, and your honest assessment of where AI still falls short, like with solution writing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience using AI in your work as a TA that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing in particular. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool in education, especially around creating appropriate-level problems while maintaining quality control, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
