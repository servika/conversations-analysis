Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No other questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to generate specific images for my vintage sunglasses site.  Specifically, I attempt to get my front facing  sunglasses directly onto an AI generated model for ecommerce purposes.  I use high quality photos  in .RW2 format and I have the background completely changed to transparency before I ask the AI model to apply the image onto the AI models face. (chatGPT, Copilot etc.) My goal is to get the sunglasses to look as close as possible to the real model I'm selling so the customer can see how they look on a persons face.  I also use AI to help me write code for my wordpress website using blocksy theme.  I ask it to design me specific blocks (Hero images, about us sections, privacy policies etc.) I also use it to do complete reviews of all my CSS code, functions.php, header.php and other files.  Some other uses for the AI include techniques of professional cleaning, polishing and restoring vintage sunglasses.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow you've developed with AI for multiple aspects of your business. It sounds like you're using AI quite strategically across different areas - from product photography to web development to restoration techniques.

Tell me more about that process of getting the sunglasses onto the AI-generated models. What does that workflow typically look like from start to finish?

User: I use a lightbox with specific lighting and diffusion techniques and a professional Lumix FZ300 camera to take front-on pictures of the sunglasses.  I then use tools like lightroom on android or pixelcut to enhance the colors in the photo and remove the background for transparency.  I then upload the sunglasses with transparent background into the chatgpt or copilot message box and ask the model to use the image as reference and generate different types of human models wearing the glasses

AI: That's a sophisticated photography and editing process you've set up. When you ask the AI to generate the human models wearing your glasses, how consistent are the results? Do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI to get the glasses positioned and sized correctly on the generated faces?

User: It's pretty inconsistent.  Most of the time the glasses do not come out with good accuracy.  Sometimes they look decent but I will need to adjust the zoom on the models face so the differences are less noticeable.  It does seem to get colors and overall frame styles right but it is not perfect in any sense.

AI: That inconsistency sounds frustrating, especially when you're putting in all that careful work with the photography and background removal upfront. 

When the results aren't quite right, what do you typically do? Do you keep iterating with the AI, or do you have other approaches you fall back on for getting those product images you need?

User: I will usually try different phrasing techniques to get the model to produce a male or female model, different clothes, different backgrounds etc.  I Know my images are clear and defined so I make multiple attempts and see what happens.

AI: So you're experimenting with different prompts to guide the output. When you're making those multiple attempts with different phrasings, how many iterations do you typically go through before you either get something usable or decide to move on to a different pair of sunglasses?

User: 2 or 3 and then the images will start looking much worse.  Chatgpt has been giving me a lot of model errors after trying to generate different images.

AI: Interesting that the quality actually degrades after those first few attempts. It sounds like there's a sweet spot in that initial window before you start hitting those model errors.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to edit specific blocks of code over a full code.  For example, if i ask the AI to fix a grid item block on wordpress and I post my full additional CSS i get much better results when I just focus on the specific lines of code related to my request.  I also notice that the AI is usually getting things mixed up from past messages so it's easier to keep the code focus very small.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping the scope narrow and focused. It sounds like you've learned that less context can actually lead to better, more targeted results.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it mostly, but with coding i need more assistance.  It is very frustrating getting the right code I need though and usually the explanations of what the errors are in the code throw  me off the goal.

AI: So it sounds like coding pushes you more toward needing that assistance, but the AI's explanations can actually create confusion rather than clarity. When you say the error explanations throw you off your goal, can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice?

User: If i post the full code of say my woocommerce CSS style customizations and ask it to identify a specific error or to change something it will come back with multiple explanations of what is wrong and what needs to be fixed with code.  However, this confuses me as my coding is intermediate

AI: Ah, I see - so the AI is giving you comprehensive feedback when you really just want the specific fix you asked for. It sounds like those broader explanations actually muddy the waters when you have a targeted goal in mind.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you're running your own vintage sunglasses business, how do industry peers or customers factor into how you approach using AI?

User: I'm not sure how other businesses in this industry are handling AI

AI: That's understandable - it sounds like you're kind of pioneering your own approach without much visibility into what others are doing.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm satisfied when the images i need come out perfectly as I ask them to be or when the AI finds the exact code that is causing an issue or needs improvement and it gives me a straight full copy of the code that i posted (but fixed) frustration is all the opposite of those and also the large amount of time its taking me to reach conclusive fixes while building my ecommerce website.  I also get many errors with chatgpt saying no models available for request and the copolit windows app freezing every single time I ask it to develop code longer than a few paragraphs.

AI: Those technical issues sound like they're creating real roadblocks, especially when you're trying to make progress on your website. The freezing and model availability errors must really disrupt your workflow.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially with coding or other aspects of your business?

User: Not really. I don't think these models are even close to developing entire websites.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use these tools, or are there particular improvements you're hoping for?

User: I can see the models being much more productive and handing different tasks.  I.e removing the background from my photos precisely and in the chat.

AI: That makes sense - having the AI handle more of those tedious, time-consuming steps directly within the workflow would be a real time-saver.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated hearing about your specific workflow challenges - like how the AI explanations can sometimes overcomplicate coding fixes when you just need a targeted solution, and how you've learned to keep your requests focused and narrow for better results.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I do not

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI for e-commerce - from the inconsistent image generation results to the workflow strategies you've developed - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear about your hands-on approach and the specific challenges you're navigating as you build your vintage sunglasses business. Best of luck with your website development and getting those product images just right!
