Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! I don't have any questions.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a freelance writer. I use AI to create plot outlines, brainstorm ideas for characters, settings, scenes. I use it to research places and details that appear in my books. And sometimes I use it to try and write chapters based off of outlines.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI touches many different parts of your creative process. 

When you mentioned using AI to write chapters based on outlines, tell me more about that. How does that typically work for you?

User: I provide the outline and ask AI to write the chapter. I give it a desired word count, and a desired tone, as well as any other specific instruction the chapter might need, like lots of punchy dialogues, or please use lots of description. I doesn't usually work too well, and I often have to rewrite large sections of the chapters because the writing lacks context and concrete details.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's a gap between what you're hoping for and what you're getting back. 

When you say the writing "lacks context and concrete details," can you walk me through what that looks like? What specific elements are missing that force you to do those rewrites?

User: As far as context goes, sometimes the writing will just shift locations in the middle of the chapter, or include something that doesn't logically sense from a sequence standpoint. It also tends to shift around a lot temporarily, or forget details from earlier in the chapter that are really important later on (like where the character are, or the hair color of a character, etcetera.) The writing also begins a lot of sentences with 'As [the main character was doing something], which is repetitive. As for concrete details, the descriptions are often generic and cliche, instead of poignant and creative.

AI: That paints a really clear picture of the challenges you're facing. It sounds like the AI struggles with maintaining continuity and creating that distinctive voice you're looking for.

Given these issues with chapter writing, I'm curious about your other uses - like plot outlines and character brainstorming. How do those work out differently for you compared to the actual chapter writing?

User: In  my experience, AI is getting pretty good at writing plot outlines. It can give a good plot outline based on my specific instructions, such as 'write me a simple plot outline for a book in the vein of James Patterson,' or suggest a cool plot for a book that would resonate on GoodNovel. The plots aren't perfect, but they're pretty effective with a little tweaking or further guidelines. I also find AI useful for brainstorming when I give it a specific situation. For example, I might tell it that I need motivation for a character to go wander around in a stranger's house, or ask it to brainstorm some ideas for potential settings that would work well for a small town romance that aren't overused. It's quite good at brainstorming potential ideas for any specific genre (synopsis or plot summaries). I've had a lot of success with using AI for plot lines and brainstorming, just not for the actual chapter writing. I find it's good at helping me generate ideas, but not so much at the actual writing.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - AI as an idea generator versus AI as a writer. It sounds like there's something fundamentally different about those two types of tasks.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Even for those areas where it works well - like plot outlines and brainstorming - are there parts of that creative process you prefer to handle yourself? What makes you want to keep certain tasks in your own hands?

User: I use AI as a starting point with outlines and brainstorming, but there are parts of the creative process that I'd rather do myself, mainly fleshing out the ideas or plots. The tasks I prefer to keep in my own hands are the ones that rely on a high level of creativity. I find that AI can give a baseline for ideas, but it doesn't have the ability to 'nuance creatively'. It's the small creative details that I like to add in myself, like a more creative motive for a character.

AI: That phrase "nuance creatively" really captures something important. It sounds like there's a layer of creative depth that you see as distinctly human.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: When I'm writing, I mostly collaborate. I've tried to delegate it to write complete sections, but it hasn't worked out so well. So I tend to go back and forth to collaborate with it during a task. Even when I do delegate, like ask it to write a plot outline, I often pick out specific things and ask it to tweak specific spots, or change things until I have something I'm happy with.

AI: That back-and-forth process sounds quite iterative. It seems like even when you start by delegating something like a plot outline, you end up in this collaborative refinement process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? As a freelancer, I'm curious about whether other writers you know, clients, or the publishing industry more broadly has shaped how you approach using these tools.

User: I approach these tools with caution, not because I don't think they're effective, but because I fear the backlash that could come with anyone knowing I'm using AI in my writing. It's a HIGHLY contentious topic out there in the 'writer's world', with other writers threatening to 'cancel' writers who use AI. There's a group of us out there though that understand the value, and sing its praises - we just don't sing them loudly. Unfortunately, a lot of people think that AI is going to put writers out of work. That hasn't been my experience at all, and honestly, I don't think it ever will. Writers write because they love to write. AI won't change that. It just allows me to write more efficiently but doing some of the heavy lifting and helping me come up with ideas. So to answer your question in a nutshell, other writers (and the publishing industry) have shaped how I approach using AI by essentially forcing me to use it secretly.

AI: That's such a revealing insight about the social dynamics around AI use. It sounds like there's this underground community of writers who find value in AI, but the broader culture creates pressure to keep it hidden.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently had a fairly well-developed chapter outline. It was pretty detailed. I asked AI to write the chapter based on the outline. I gave it very explicit instructions for word count, tone, style, etc. But half way through the chapter it wrote for me, it strayed so far from the outline I gave it that the chapter didn't even make sense. I was super frustrated. So I asked it to rewrite the chapter, based on the outline I provided, but to only give me a skeletal chapter (without many details). The rewrite it gave was pretty good. I used it as a baseline for the chapter and added in all the creative, nuanced details I wanted.

AI: That's a great example of how you've learned to adapt your approach based on what works and what doesn't. It sounds like you discovered that asking for a "skeletal chapter" gives you a better foundation to build on.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not afraid of AI taking over my job completely. I'm a human and AI isn't. I write because I want to, because I have stories to tell and I want to make my readers feel something. I imagine a lot of people will use AI to write their books for them, and AI might get to the point where it can write decent fiction, but writers (real writers) will always write, and people will always read stories. It is something I've actively considered, but I think, eventually, there will be both things out in the world - AI written books and human written books.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the future landscape. It sounds like you see room for both approaches to coexist.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I might start using it to write more scenes (like scenes I don't want to write myself) if it improves. In the future, I can see myself using it to create book covers, to research trending tropes, to write catchy blurbs for my books or other social media marketing things. If I can use AI to do all the grunt work that comes along with self-publishing, then it frees up more time for me to do the thing I enjoy most - the actual writing. So I guess my relationship will evolve into using AI as a personal assistant of sorts, which I haven't really tapped into yet.

AI: That vision of AI as a personal assistant handling the "grunt work" is really compelling - it sounds like you see it potentially freeing you up to focus on the parts of writing you're most passionate about.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that underground community of writers and how you've learned to work around AI's limitations by asking for skeletal chapters instead of fully fleshed-out ones.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the creative collaboration process, the social dynamics in the writing community, and how you've adapted your approach to work with AI's strengths and limitations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective as someone who's found that sweet spot of using AI as a creative partner while maintaining your own artistic vision. Thanks again!
