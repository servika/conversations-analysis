Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for a couple of things. I own a food truck that has unique menu names for my ice cream dishes. I use it for brainstorming those names. For example, I would give it a list of the ingredients and ask for a name for the menu. I also use it for calculations such as food cost analysis if I'm too busy to do it myself (which is a lot of the time!). I am planning on changing my corporate name so I also had a detailed conversation on the possibilities for that as well.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI for some pretty creative and practical aspects of running your business. 

When you're brainstorming those unique menu names, how does that process typically work? Do you find yourself going back and forth with AI to refine the names, or do you usually get what you need from the first response?

User: I sometimes never get a good name, and sometimes they come up with something great! It is never on the first try, though. I always have to go back and forth.

AI: Tell me more about that back-and-forth process. What usually happens that makes you want to keep refining the suggestions?

User: I would start by sending a list of the ingredients in the dish, and give the AI my company name (which is unique) so that they could incorporate that name into the dish somehow. I would usually like one or two suggestions and ask the bot to tweak it a bit.

AI: That's a nice collaborative approach. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do prefer to do my cost analysis myself if I have the time.  I don't trust that the numbers are always accurate from AI. It is important that those numbers are correct. For example,  the pricing on one of my main ingredients went up so I wanted to make sure that I was still making money on that item so I asked for a detailed cost analysis of that menu item. I needed an answer quickly, but I later double-checked to make sure it was accurate (and it was!).

AI: That makes a lot of sense - accuracy is crucial when it comes to your bottom line. It sounds like you're strategic about when to use AI for those calculations versus doing them yourself.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate with creative tasks, and with financial ones I leave it to complete the task independently.

AI: That's a clear distinction between how you approach different types of tasks. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you own the food truck, how do any employees or business contacts feel about your AI use?

User: My employees or business contacts are not aware of my AI use. I only use it for admin and creative tasks in my personal office. My employees are physically on my food truck, where there is no AI use.

AI: That's an interesting separation - keeping AI use for the behind-the-scenes work while the hands-on operations remain purely human.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There are 2 instances that come to mind, both related to coming up with a name for a new menu item. In the first case, it came up with the perfect name after a few rounds of back and forth with me. In the second case, I was frustrated and gave up after it made the same suggestions over and over (that were not good).

AI: That's really telling - it sounds like when AI gets stuck in a loop, it can be quite frustrating. What was different about those two situations? Was it the type of dish, how you described the ingredients, or something else that might have led to such different outcomes?

User: I honestly don't know what was different other than the way the AI responded. I presented the question the same way both times. It could be that the second one was more difficult to come up with a good name for.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI can't take over the food truck business. I have to drive the truck, load the supplies, serve the customers. As far as the admin work goes, yes it could take over some of those functions. But I don't think it will ever have the human approach that I do with my customers. The reason for my success is that people are invested in me, as a person, as well as my business.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the human element being irreplaceable in your business success.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will use it in much the same way that I do now. The only thing that could be added is that I may set it up to answer my customers (in the distant future), but I would always double-check the interaction. I can see how bigger companies would let AI do its thing, but we need the personal touch.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the personal connection with customers remains irreplaceable, and how you've found that sweet spot between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining that human touch that drives your success.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about running a food truck business while strategically incorporating AI for creative brainstorming and administrative tasks - while keeping that essential human connection with customers - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both the successes and frustrations you've experienced. It's been a pleasure talking with you!
