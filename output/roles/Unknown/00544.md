Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my role as a planning engineer within the Aviation industry, Ai has become a brilliant support tool for me and my team. I often use Ai to clean and format data often saving me 30 mins +. I'll also use it to check important emails, if I'm sending a new email to an important person, customer or key stakeholder, I'll run through Ai to be sure it's 100%. It can also help generate a presentable weekly plan from updates in the schedule that I provide. Overall, its changed the way I work for the better.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your workflow as a planning engineer. You mentioned using it for data cleaning and formatting, which saves you significant time.

Can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? When you say you're cleaning and formatting data, what does that involve exactly?

User: Often I will receive information from the shopfloor in various different formats, it could be a job number, or a job description, or half a job number or description of where in the aircraft wants to be worked next. I use AI to find the full job number from these small bits of information, by providing it with the necessary resource. This is the job that I have found to be the most time consuming as I used to have to search Boeing's ERP system manually for every random piece of information I get.

AI: That sounds like a huge time-saver! So you're essentially using AI to match incomplete information from the shop floor to the complete job numbers in Boeing's ERP system. 

When you say you provide it with "the necessary resource" - what does that look like? Are you giving the AI access to certain databases or documents to help it make those matches?

User: To be honest I keep it to the very necessary, and it will often be a resource that without the context would mean nothing. For example, if I need to find the necessary job number from a description I provide controlled datasets, which can then be used to find number that I need, If I was to do this on Boeing's ERP I would have to search for the description and it'd then return a few options, I'd then have to find the correct one and then search that number with the corresponding aircraft to find the correct job number.

AI: That's a really smart approach - you're essentially creating a streamlined lookup process. So instead of going through multiple search steps in Boeing's ERP system, you're giving the AI just the controlled datasets it needs to make those connections directly.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several different uses - data formatting, email checking, and generating weekly plans. Are there certain tasks in your planning engineer role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Yeah there are a few things I prefer to do myself. For example, when I use AI to make the plan it is provide with a small set of job numbers and manpower and that is all. The list of numbers has already been chosen by me through cross referring with the critical path and making my own decision on whether a job number that could be worked should be. There is also a lot of processes I must strictly adhere to that involve quality assurance checks, that I could possibly delegate to Ai, however, I don't feel safe to do so yet, due to the nature of the industry, so I continue to do this. So really for me, Ai is currently just used for efficiency in the background and I continue to do the analysis and decision making.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping the critical decision-making and quality assurance in your hands, especially given the safety-critical nature of aviation. It sounds like you've found a really thoughtful balance where AI handles the time-consuming background tasks while you maintain control over the analytical and judgment-heavy work.

When you use AI for those efficiency tasks - like the data formatting or generating plans from your selected job numbers - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it what it needs and let it handle the complete task independently?

User: I think the first time I used it for either of the mentioned tasks there was a fair bit of back and forth to get where I was happy, however, with data formatting now I can generally just give it the controlled dataset and say what I need and leave the model to work it's magic. But for a more open-ended task like drafting plans there will be a little more back and forth, because every now and then the model might give me something back that I don't always agree with, so we hash it out together until I'm content. Overall, it's a mix but generally for data formatting its a one-and-done approach, and more iterative for the weekly plan tasks.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like you've developed different interaction styles based on how structured versus open-ended the task is. The data formatting has become more of a streamlined handoff, while the planning work remains more collaborative.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others on your team using it similarly, or has the adoption been different across your workplace?

User: To be honest I'd say I am the AI Pioneer within the team, there are couple of guys that are in their 50s and it has taken some convincing for me to use it and they are now even using it! As a workplace there is no push to use Ai, its not even really acknowledged. There a few guys similar age to me that saw me adopt it and then adopted themselves straight away. Overall, the workplace doesn't really seem to be looking at AI, which I am surprised about and as for the team it wasn't really used at all until I started adopting some time saving uses.

AI: That's fascinating - so you've essentially been the catalyst for AI adoption within your team. It sounds like you've had to do some convincing, especially with the more experienced colleagues, but you've been successful in showing them the value.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A moment that really stood out for me was when I was tasked with preparing a weekly update that pulled from multiple sources that weren't aligned. I used AI to cross reference the datasets, clean them up, and generate a clear summary table. I still validated everything myself after but the time it saved was massive and the report went out ahead of schedule. It's actually what convinced the older guys on my time that actually Ai might be a positive thing.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can deliver tangible results that others can see. It sounds like that successful weekly update became a bit of a proof of concept for your team.

You mentioned that you still validated everything yourself afterward - that seems to be a consistent theme in how you work with AI. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Its a good point and it is something I often think about. For me Ai is a great support tool and I don't want to lose my underlying skills as a planning engineer. From time to time I make a conscious effort to do certain things manually, for example I'll still build trackers in excel from scratch and often cross check jobs myself if the dataset is small and AI doesn't seem as time saving.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - being intentional about preserving those core skills while still leveraging AI's benefits. It shows you're thinking strategically about your professional development.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular direction?

User: I'd like to see it integrated more on the shopfloor, there is plenty of use cases I can think of that'd save the technicians loads of time. For example, once a job number is assigned to a team it could order all of the necessary tools get any drawings needed loaded and give the technician a brief summary of the job so they can get their head round it quicker. It'd also be good for stores as they could get parts out ahead of time based on the provided plan. Overall, I'd like to see a more widespread adoption across the company to make everything more efficient for everyone, however, I'm not sure I see that happening anytime soon it is generally a bit of an old fashioned industry.

AI: Those are really insightful ideas - you're thinking about AI's potential impact across the entire workflow, from planning through to execution on the shop floor. It sounds like you can see the bigger picture of how it could transform efficiency across the whole operation.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being that AI pioneer in your team and how you balance leveraging AI's efficiency while maintaining your core planning engineering skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think the only thing I'd like to add is that for me, AI isn't only about saving time on daily tasks but also a way of changing how people think about problem solving. The example I mentioned earlier when I sent the report out earlier, there was a lot of hesitation before about AI in the workplace before that, but after that it shifted the conversation from "why would use this" to "how else can we apply this".

AI: That's a really powerful insight - you're describing how AI can shift workplace culture from skepticism to curiosity, changing the fundamental question people ask. That transformation from "why would we use this" to "how else can we apply this" seems like it could have lasting effects beyond just the immediate time savings.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being an AI pioneer in a traditional industry, the thoughtful way you balance AI assistance with skill preservation, and especially how you've influenced your team's mindset will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
