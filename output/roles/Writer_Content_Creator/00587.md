Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions. Let's proceed.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI multiple ways, mostly as a tool. I sometimes just need a definition or help with a particular word choice. Other times, I use it to spark ideas and brainstorm. And still other times, I use it as a first step in performing research, where I typically then ask for the sources the AI used in helping to answer my question.

AI: That's a helpful overview. Let me dig a bit deeper into one of those areas you mentioned. When you say you use AI to spark ideas and brainstorm, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? What's happening in those moments when you turn to AI for that kind of help?

User: I generally start with a sketch of whatever job I am working on. My role has typically been to draft copy for presentations, then write brochures, direct mail appeals, ads (radio scripts and print, and now social media). I will enter keywords, typically related to the company or product I am working for and the audience we are pursuing, and I just kind of like to bounce ideas off of an AI helper the way I used to do it working alongside graphic artists and designers. It's kind of hard to describe, because it is a relatively new tool for me, and I am super-conscious of plagiarism, and trying to avoid it.

AI: That comparison to bouncing ideas off graphic artists and designers is really interesting. Tell me more about that - how does the back-and-forth with AI compare to those human collaborations you used to have?

User: I have discovered in my career that people who are really good at creating visual media tend to look at communications projects differently than me. Now, AI is an extension of that same idea. I enjoy working with creative people, and I have found AI to have that same kind of "different" approach where we are both just kind of throwing different ideas and suggestions at each other, that I can then take into my own head as I try to continue my creative process. It's hard to describe, really, but the designers I have worked with have always agreed that writers and visual content creators just "see" problems and obstacles in different ways, and they have generally appreciated my feedback as much as I appreciate theirs. I have found the same kind of "different" thinking working more independently with just AI available at the inception point. I hope that is a helpful description?

AI: That's a really vivid description, thank you. I can hear how much you value that "different thinking" perspective. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned being super-conscious of plagiarism - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes you draw that line?

User: I write everything in my own words. I might be interested in how AI approaches things, but I never "copy and paste" complete sentences and claim them as my own creations. For example, I have some difficulty writing dialogue, so I have asked AI to create a conversation based on a particular concept or topic. I offer some parameters (characters, situation, etc.) and let the AI create, then assess the output for creative angles I can then explore.

AI: That's a clear distinction you make between getting creative angles versus copying text directly. When you assess that AI-generated dialogue for creative angles, what are you typically looking for? What makes you think "that's an angle I want to explore" versus "that's not quite right for what I need"?

User: There is no universal or scientific way to quantify it. It is the creative process. It involves exploring ideas, and the more ideas I find myself exposed to (that aren't my own), the more creative ideas (I want to explore) kind of reveal themselves. I hope that makes sense?

AI: That makes perfect sense - you're describing that spark of recognition when an idea opens up new possibilities for you. 

When you're in that creative exploration mode with AI, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth conversation throughout developing an idea, or do you tend to get what you need from AI and then go work independently?

User: It has been both ways as your question suggests - there really isn't a "typical" way to how I interact with AI (yet). I enjoy "shooting the breeze"-style conversations, so I really enjoy the back and forth interacting with AI (and even finding small corrections or challenges to make of the AI's responses, to keep the discussion going, or to change directions). But I also have used AI with just single, one-shot-then-off queries, then I just go back to whatever I may have been doing. I believe there are more and better ways to use AI, I just don't know what they are, so I just keep exploring to see what ways it can truly help. Btw, I love and loathe predictive text - that's an aspect of AI, isn't it? (Although I don't think that is really what this interview is about.) I have always written professionally using just a word processor, a dictionary, and a thesaurus. I find predictive text is terrible at guessing the word I am trying to find (in many, many situations), and my fumbling fingers (thumbs especially!) end up inserting automatically suggested words that I then have to go back, delete, and replace. It gets kind of frustrating, so I have gone back to writing using just a text input notepad (because tools like Google Docs won't allow me to turn off certain features). And, don't get me started on MS-Word, although I can turn off copilot there - but I learned to do my job using drop-down menus, the formatting ribbon tried to replace some steps and make things easier, but it just made things more difficult for someone who felt comfortable writing and creating publishable concepts a certain way.

AI: You've touched on something really interesting there about the tools themselves sometimes getting in your way rather than helping. That frustration with predictive text interfering with your process - that sounds like it connects to your earlier point about being very intentional about writing in your own words.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it, or are you more of an early adopter in your environment?

User: I truly think I am an early adopter in many ways. And because I am only part-time and always remote now, I do not have many personal interactions directly with other humans these days. I get paid to produce ideas and thoughts, and every now and then to complete written documents (blog posts, newsletter articles, mailings, etc.). I freelanced much of my career, so one of the frustrations as a freelancer is it is mostly spot work. I get to work on a particular project, but rarely get to be involved in entire campaigns. So, I guess I get to use AI however I choose, there is no "work culture" as a freelancer.

AI: That's really insightful - having that freedom to explore AI on your own terms without workplace constraints sounds both liberating and maybe a bit isolating. Since you mentioned you get paid to produce ideas and thoughts, can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was ghost-writing a blog post for a client. I included a term that I thought I understood and knew its origins, so I said a particular group "coined" the term. "Coined" has deeper connotations than I thought, and I was fact-checked on applying that "detail" to the term the post was discussing. Because of the fact-check feedback, I was able to go back to AI to do deeper research into the term's origins (find out who actually "coined" it -- or at least who history has attributed the term to), early users, and possible alternate meanings, and then I was able to take that AI-assisted research information and use it to clarify the position I had taken for my post.

AI: That's a great example of how AI helped you dig deeper when you needed it. It sounds like the fact-checking actually opened up a more thorough research process. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Look, I'm old. I have worked using a keyboard for 44 years. I enjoy writing, and I enjoy researching new things. I like to be aware. I take pride in trying to keep up with culture and trying new things (even if I never truly reach that level of understanding needed to use or do those new things). I think less about AI potentially taking over and more about just enjoying the few hours I get to sit and ruminate, and just create. To me, AI has been a fun new thing to explore. My arthritic thumbs hurt and seem to have a mind of their own. I have developed what some have identified as carpal tunnel. I refuse to use voice input because I can't stand my own voice, I have a stammer, and I have always written to help define what I think. I don't really know how much longer I will use AI or even want to use AI (for work or play). So, no, I guess I do not "actively consider" how AI could possibly replace someone with my skillset. I think I worry more about the sci-fi AI scenario where AI becomes sentient and decides to exterminate humans from the world because we humans have added a level of chaos to nature and our world that is as cataclysmic as anything humans (and human-made machines) have ever pondered or faced.

AI: Thank you for that honest reflection. Your perspective on just enjoying the creative process itself, regardless of the tools, comes through really clearly.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Given everything you've shared about exploration and keeping up with new things, what feels most interesting or important to you about that future?

User: Well, I did have some basic coding questions the other day. I was able to use AI to explore ways to create a semi-interactive website using HTML, CSS, and just a touch of javascript to perform a certain function (personalizing a set design with alternate pre-written (but also custom-worded) tag lines. It was an interesting interaction, and I am still in the early stages of optimizing what AI provided.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI helping you explore new territory beyond your usual writing work. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI provides that "different thinking" approach, similar to your collaborations with graphic designers, and how you maintain your creative ownership while using it as a research and brainstorming partner.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so. I think the world is learning the importance of using custom system prompts to get the most out of an AI assistant. I think more energy should be spent (although I don't know that it isn't already done so in traditional work settings?) on training people to use AI as an assistive tool, rather than always doomsaying that is taking away jobs. Thanks for letting me rant.

AI: Not a rant at all - that's a really valuable insight about the importance of training people to see AI as assistive rather than replacement technology. The point about custom system prompts is interesting too - it suggests there's a skill development aspect that could be really beneficial for people to learn.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the creative collaboration aspect and how you navigate maintaining your own voice while leveraging AI's different perspective will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Good bye. Thanks for your time.

AI: Thank you so much, and goodbye! I really appreciate you sharing your experiences with me today.
