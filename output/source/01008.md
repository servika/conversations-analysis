Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: We may begin

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to quickly gather data and compile information that are harder to just simply search myself.

AI: That's helpful - tell me more about what makes those information gathering tasks harder to search for yourself.

User: One example of my most recent use of AI; I asked "The stock market is currently at All Time Highs, the Fed Reserve is going to cut rates next week. Looking at history, what usually happens to the market?"

AI: That's a really interesting example. What drew you to use AI for that particular question rather than trying to research it through other means?

User: Although its not too complex a question, finding that answer by my own searches will take a lot longer. AI is able to do it in a fraction of the time.

AI: That makes sense - the time savings seem significant. When AI gives you that kind of analysis, like about market patterns after rate cuts, how do you typically use that information? Do you take it as-is, or do you find yourself wanting to verify or build on it somehow?

User: At the moment, I mainly use Chatgpt 5, it has up to date information. I usually take the information as-is

AI: Interesting that you trust the information as-is. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I mainly use AI for broader, time-consuming tasks. Like gathering and compiling data. But, when its decision time, I use my own judgment.

AI: That's a clear distinction you've drawn between gathering information and making decisions. Could you walk me through what that looks like in practice? When you get that market analysis from AI, what does your decision-making process look like from there?

User: Like for example I would ask AI to give me a list of top performing AI stocks with a market cap between $100 million and $1 billion.

AI: That's a great example of the data gathering. And once you have that list of AI stocks in that market cap range, how do you move from that information to actually making your investment decisions?

User: I go through the list, check the stock charts myself. And if there are things I like on the chart, I make a note of its potential.

AI: So you're doing your own technical analysis on the charts after AI provides the initial filtering. When you use AI for work like this, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it throughout your research, or do you tend to ask for specific deliverables and then work independently from there?

User: If there's a big list, I use additional filtering, like the stock has to be above its 100 day moving average. But usually the conversation wont be too long.

AI: That sounds like a pretty efficient workflow - get what you need and move on. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you approach AI similarly, or have you noticed different patterns?

User: AI use definitely has been picking up fast. The time-savings part of it is too valuable

AI: You mention the time-savings being too valuable to ignore. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated? Maybe in the earlier days, where getting a good answer was a bit difficult. But, it has mostly improved drastically since. Using AI to summarize large amounts of text/data has helped me a lot.

AI: That improvement over time sounds significant. When you mention summarizing large amounts of text and data, what kinds of materials are you typically having AI work through? And how do those summaries fit into your broader workflow?

User: One example would be the FOMC minutes that are released. I would use AI to read the previous one, then compare it to the most recent one.

AI: That's a really practical use case - having AI compare FOMC minutes to identify what's changed. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, there is no way I can process information faster than AI. So thats a concern.

AI: That's an honest concern. When you think about that challenge, how do you navigate it? Are there specific ways you're thinking about staying valuable in your work despite AI's information processing speed?

User: If you trade stocks using technical analysis, you would already assume theres a "composite operator" working against you. Nothings changed there.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - framing AI as similar to the existing competitive forces you already navigate in trading. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving from where it is today?

User: Maybe something like where its able to track a large lists of stocks, that I have set a lot of specific parameters i.e. above 100 day moving average, RSi under 40, candle patterns. And give me alerts or even trade for me when those parameters are met.

AI: That vision of AI handling complex parameter monitoring and potentially even executing trades is quite sophisticated. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on viewing AI as similar to existing competitive forces in trading - that's a really unique way of thinking about it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thats all I have.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for data gathering and analysis while maintaining your own judgment for decisions, and especially that perspective on AI as another competitive force rather than something entirely new, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your workflow and share your thoughts on where this is all heading. Take care!
