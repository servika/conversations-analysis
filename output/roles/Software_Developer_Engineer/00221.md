Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Sure

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a software developer at a science research lab...I've used AI to help me look up ways to code things or to explain how some code works. Software development is handled very differently where I work and we often work in silos based on the scientific group we are supporting, so I don't have a ton of co-workers to discuss things like this with and AI has been very helpful.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is filling a gap where you might not have as much peer collaboration available. 

Can you walk me through what that actually looks like when you're working? Like, when you hit a coding challenge or need to understand something, what does your process of turning to AI typically involve?

User: For instance, right now I'm preparing to develop a web application that will plot data from experiments. I've described what sort of plotting I'm looking for and asked Chat GPT about different Javascript plotting utilities that might be useful, and then I've asked for code to use those libraries.

AI: So you're using it both for discovery - finding the right tools - and then for implementation help with those tools. 

When you get that code back from ChatGPT, what do you typically do with it? Do you use it as-is, or does it become more of a starting point for your own work?

User: Definitely more of a starting point

AI: Tell me more about that process - what happens after you get that initial code? How do you work from there?

User: So for this plotting example, I asked the AI to generate essentially a library of plotting functions that I could then incorporate into a web page. It took some tweaking and back and forth with the AI  to be able to get it where I wanted it. Now I'm working on the web page/HTML part of it and will start incorporating that Javascript library.

AI: That back-and-forth tweaking process sounds interesting. When you're going through those iterations with the AI, are you working together on refining the same piece of code, or are you taking what it gives you, trying it out on your own, and then coming back with specific issues?

User: Typically the second scenario - taking what it gives me, trying it, and then going back and describing any problems or issues that I want changed

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your development work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Some things I like to think about on my own or trying to describe what I'm looking for would be harder and more time-consuming than just doing it myself.

AI: Can you give me an example of something that falls into that category - where describing it to AI would be more work than just doing it yourself?

User: Like if I have other code that's already been written and I don't necessarily want to bring all of that into what I'm asking for because I just want help with something specific.

AI: That makes sense - there's that context barrier where you'd need to explain too much background. 

When you do use AI for work tasks, it sounds like you've settled into a pattern where you delegate a specific piece to it, then iterate based on what comes back. Do you ever find yourself working more collaboratively with AI - like thinking through a problem together step by step - or is it mostly that delegation approach?

User: Mostly that delegation approach.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned earlier that you work more in silos - has that shaped how you think about using these tools?

User: I don't think it's necessarily shaped anything with how I use these tools, but we have discussed the use of AI in our work so it's definitely become more of a relevant tool for us

AI: What kinds of discussions have you had about AI use? Are people generally sharing how they're using it, or is it more about policies around using it?

User: A little of both, I guess. Other folks have used it for basic coding. We've also generally talked about potentially developing a chatbot or something as a tool for the scientists to use but we haven't really started seriously working on anything like that.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The going back and forth can be very rewarding and very frustrating. For example with this plotting library...it took a lot of clarification about certain details, like how the x and y axes would work or how the mouse clicks would work. Also debugging certain things. It's harder to debug because I didn't write the original code so I either have to go back and understand what the model was trying to do or I have to do a lot of back and forth describing exactly what's happening that's wrong and then exactly what it should be doing instead.

AI: That debugging challenge sounds particularly tricky - you're dealing with code that's written in someone else's style, essentially. When you're in those frustrating back-and-forth cycles, what keeps you using AI rather than just rewriting the code yourself from scratch?

User: I've gotten close to the point of abandoning ship and writing it myself, but haven't needed to yet. I think if it ever got to where the AI was just absolutely not giving me what I wanted and I wasn't able to describe something any better than I was, that would be the point that I would just write it myself.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Right now incorporating AI into what I'm doing feels useful...I think AI will eventually be able to do a lot of the code development, but knowing what to ask for and describe it is a useful skill for now. I haven't really thought about it much more than that.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm not sure, but I imagine using it more and more...perhaps in the collaborative way that you brought up earlier

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the debugging process can be both rewarding and frustrating when you're working with code you didn't originally write.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working in a more isolated environment, the iterative process of refining AI-generated code, and that balance between when to persist with AI versus doing it yourself will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me today!
