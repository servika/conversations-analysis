Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, I'm ready

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a novelist, so I have multiple creative areas. Firstly, of course, writing the novel! But then there is also creating the cover, which is a very different creative task, and also maintaining social media accounts as my author self.

AI: That's fascinating - you're juggling multiple creative disciplines as a novelist. It sounds like each of those areas - the writing itself, cover design, and social media - would require quite different creative approaches and skill sets.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools across these different areas of your work?

User: OK so Part 1, the novel. I like to use AI to brainstorm ideas. I might say 'give me 5 ideas for a YA scifi that is genre-specific' and see what sparks from the suggestions. When I have a plot, I will run it by AI to see if there's any gaping plot holes that I was too close to see. And in the editing phase, an AI-powered grammar/spellcheck. For part 2, making covers, I use AI to guide me through any Photoshop process I'm not sure of. I might ask it to generate an image if I can't find a good one on the stock photo sites. And Photoshop has an AI feature that extends an image - I find that really handy. For the third area, social media, I have AI help me with using Canva, and also suggesting colours that go well together for certain themes. I also ask AI for hashtag help.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview - it sounds like AI has become integrated into each phase of your work in different ways. I'm curious about one of those uses you mentioned.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI for brainstorming novel ideas? What was that process like, and how did it feel to work with AI in that initial creative stage?

User: I really find AI indispensable! So, for the brainstorming, as I said I would start with an initial "come up with 5 ideas for a story". Oftentimes, one idea will spark an idea for me. It might not be exactly what the AI suggested, but it's "inspired by". Then I will ask for a more specific plot, incorporating my ideas as I go. The finished plot line is pretty much my idea rather than the AI, but I find the process really gets my creativity ticking - similar to how a writing prompt is used in creative writing classes.

AI: That's a really insightful comparison to writing prompts in creative writing classes. It sounds like the AI serves as a creative catalyst rather than doing the creative work itself.

When you're in that back-and-forth brainstorming process with AI - incorporating your ideas as you go and building on what sparks for you - how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions? How does that collaboration feel to you?

User: I'm definitely the one driving the decisions, but with the inspiration. For example, we might be discussing an idea and the AI will throw something in like "the teacher has a secret identity", and that doesn't really work but then I think *what if the man next door had a secret identity?* Left to my own devices, I might not have thought of secret identities at all, or at least not so quickly. The collaboration feels great. There's some saying about how if you want to fully understand something, you should try to explain it to another person, and the AI is there 24/7 to have these conversations. In real life, nobody wants to hear about your thoughts on Chapter 15 at 3am :D

AI: That's such a relatable point about having someone available at 3am to discuss Chapter 15! And I love that example about how "the teacher has a secret identity" morphed into your own idea about the neighbor - it really illustrates that catalyst effect you mentioned.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has it shifted how you approach any part of the novel-writing process, or maybe your confidence in tackling certain tasks?

User: I've definitely become more of a plotter rather than a pantser, and I think that's been a huge improvement. And my confidence has improved because the AI always says the idea is a great idea, and while I know it says everything is a great idea, sometimes you just need to hear it!

AI: That's such an honest observation about how even knowing the AI says everything is great, it still helps! And it's interesting that AI has shifted you toward being more of a plotter - that seems like a pretty fundamental change to your creative process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: I have noticed that in some quarters, there's an almost Luddite-esque backlash towards any form of AI at all. The whole "it will take all our jobs and destroy human creativity" thing. And while I don't subscribe to that personally, I do feel the need to hide the AI involvement that I do utilise, to avoid backlash. There is also the 'get-rich-quick' crowd that will churn out entirely AI-created fiction, but I think they will be a flash in the pan and real, human-driven storytelling will prevail. Just with better spell-checks :D

AI: That tension you describe is really interesting - feeling like you need to hide something that's genuinely helpful to your creative process because of broader concerns in the field. It sounds like you see a clear distinction between how you use AI as a creative tool versus those "get-rich-quick" approaches.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think the ways you're using it now will change, or do you anticipate new areas where it might become useful?

User: I suppose it depends more on how AI evolves over the next few years. It's come so far, so fast, so who knows what it will be capable of in 5 years time? I think it will certainly be better at critiquing a full-length (70k word) novel, and that will be great. I also think (hope) models will become very tailored towards their individual user. So, for example, if my AI model and I have already worked on 4 novels, when we start the 5th one, it has a deep understanding of my 'voice' and style. The same model, purchased and used by another person, would produce different results. That's what I'd like to see, anyway!

AI: That vision of a personalized AI that develops a deep understanding of your individual voice and style over multiple projects is really compelling. It sounds like you're envisioning a long-term creative partnership that grows and evolves.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI across all the different aspects of your work as a novelist. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a creative catalyst rather than replacing your creativity, and your honest observation about the tensions in the field around AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's everything. Thank you for your time!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a creative catalyst, the shift from pantsing to plotting, and your vision for personalized AI partnerships have been incredibly valuable. It's clear you've found a thoughtful balance in integrating AI across all aspects of your work while maintaining your creative agency.

Your perspectives will be really helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your current and future novels!
