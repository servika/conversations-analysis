Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good. No, I do not have any questions before we begin.

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI is not used exclusively by either of my jobs (daycare or teaching parenting classes) how ever it is something I use to generate ideas and support both the teachers and parents. For the daycare this could look like using AI to help create lesson plans, activities, or collect thoughts about an incident that happened. For the parenting classes that can be helping a parent create a plan for a specific behavior, writing an email for a difficult interaction or help understanding what to charge clients based on the amount of time I am with them and the amount of time I spend outside of our sessions preparing for our meeting.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a creative and planning partner across both of your roles. 

I'm curious about when you mentioned using AI to "collect thoughts about an incident that happened" at the daycare. Can you tell me more about what that looks like? How does AI help you process or organize your thinking around those situations?

User: If there is a repeated behavior or a larger incident (such as a child who has become aggressive) I will use it to brainstorm consequences and behavior plans that also fit within our state guidelines and company policy. Sometimes it can be tricky to manage behavior because we are not the parents but for many of our children we actually interact more with the child in the amount of hours we spend with them than their parents do. We tend to not have authority yet need to have good behavior management or there is chaos. AI helps to 1. help me decompress if it was a rather difficult interaction. 2. Collect and organize my thoughts and 3. create a plan that stays within parameters outlined above. For instance we had a child who was specifically scratching me over and over.  I was able to process some frustration around that behavior and then organize some strategies for how to prevent the behavior and the proper discipline to use if the behavior did occur. For me it helped me to re-center and gain confidence that the plan I had was well thought out and applicable to the situation.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to use AI - it sounds like it serves multiple functions for you in those challenging moments. The part about helping you decompress and re-center is particularly striking.

When you're working through those difficult situations with AI, do you find yourself having more of a back-and-forth conversation with it as you develop the plan, or do you typically present the situation and let it generate suggestions that you then adapt?

User: I typically present the situation and let it generate suggestions that I then adapt. In fact I find myself often ignoring the follow up questions and just moving on with the plan I already had for my own line of questioning.

AI: That's a really clear pattern - it sounds like you use AI more as a springboard for your own thinking rather than as an ongoing collaborator. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to create schedules on my own. I feel that AI does not have a good grasp on the amount of time it takes for certain things. For instance, it is not good at understanding how long it takes to bring 15 toddlers outside to the playground (sometimes 15-20 minutes). It would put something like that at 2-5 minutes because that is how long it physically takes to walk outside, negating all the stopping, crying, falling down etc that happens. Similarly in my parenting classes job it doesn't factor in that many of the issues may stem from stress or difficulties in the parents life and they may be short on time, babysitters etc. They may need more time to answer a question or work through something because they have to stop and take care of a child or are also working while trying to juggle something. I've found that AI will make the generalized suggestion to add in buffer times but does not do a good job of actually presenting that itself and therefore its easier for me to just do that on my own.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like AI misses those real-world nuances and the human elements that you're so attuned to from your direct experience. The toddler playground example really illustrates that gap between theoretical time and actual time with all the unpredictable moments.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing AI use with coworkers, or is it something you've adopted more independently?

User: I am one of the only ones who use AI on a regular basis and only because I am acquainted with it from outside my normal working hours. This really is something I have adopted more independently.

AI: So you're kind of pioneering this on your own in your workplaces. That's an interesting position to be in.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Working with AI to figure out parenting plans has been helpful because I am able to enter in the "brain dump" of the notes I took while in the session with the parent and then it organizes it all. That has always been something I personally struggled with and it really helps me have a good idea of the direction I want the next session to go in before it starts. It feels good to be able to be confident in directing the parents on what is next.

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful way AI supports your work - turning that overwhelming "brain dump" into something organized and actionable. The confidence piece you mentioned seems important.

Have you had any particularly frustrating experiences with AI in your work, or has it generally been positive for you?

User: Mostly just that sometimes AI does not understand those human experiences of time and emotion (and how much time dealing with an emotional experience takes). AI tends to be very mechanical and working with small children is anything but.

AI: That makes perfect sense - there's such a contrast between AI's mechanical approach and the very human, emotional reality of working with young children and families.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I actually think that AI has helped me sharpen my skills. I don't personally use AI in a way to do the work for me but to rather streamline the work I am doing. So for me it helps sharpen the skills I already have because AI does the work of sorting and my brain has more space to be creative. Its like allowing a calculator to do the "simple math" so I have brain space and time to do the harder calculations.

AI: That's a great analogy - AI handling the "simple math" so you can focus on the more complex work. It sounds like you've found a way to use it that actually enhances rather than replaces your expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: I could see in my field (teaching and counseling) people using it similarly to what I am to stream line things. I could also see teachers using it to do things like write lesson plans, create tests and quizzes, and so on so they have more time to handle the large class sizes.  I want to work very hard not to use AI differently. I think its really important to be able to keep a "human touch" in things like counseling and teaching where I am supporting someone's education or emotional processing. I would never want to use AI so much that I simply become an assembly line for my clients thoughts and issues.

AI: That's such an important distinction you're making - using AI to enhance your capacity for human connection rather than replacing it. The "assembly line" image really captures what you're trying to avoid.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you decompress and re-center after difficult situations, and your clear intention to maintain that human touch in your counseling and teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that is it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a tool for organization and emotional processing while maintaining the human elements that are so crucial in your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving what makes your work fundamentally human. Take care!
