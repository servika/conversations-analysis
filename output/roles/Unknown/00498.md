Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm good to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My main use of AI is for strategic development brainstorming for complex organizational challenges I face. I have custom bots I use for specific uses outside of that, like a blog writing bot, grant writing bot for non profits my business serves, etc.

AI: That's interesting that you've created these specialized bots for different purposes. 

When you're using AI for strategic development brainstorming on those complex organizational challenges, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you approach working through those challenges with AI?

User: Well, typically I will spend time to write a lengthy initial prompt to establish context for a long-term challenge that I'm looking to solve. I usually spend considerable time thinking about how I want the chatbot to interact with me for that specific channel of thought. Sometimes I do this within a GPT project folder, other times I use other interfaces, depending on what the need is. For example, if it's standard business strategy, I usually work with gpt project folders. But, if it's writing focus or writing intensive, I prefer claude.

AI: That preparation work you do upfront sounds quite intentional. When you're crafting those lengthy initial prompts to establish context, what are you typically trying to capture or set up for the AI to understand about your situation?

User: I want the model to have as much information as possible about how I arrived to the challenge I'm facing, and what my end goal is. To me, AI chatbot interaction for work is not worth doing if its just to skirt easy to perform tasks. I want to use it to help me tackle complex conversations or thought processes. In order for that to be effective, most of my conversation with the chatbot is actually designed for it to gather information. For example, there have been times when I've placed a requirement in my initial prompt for the chatbot to ask me 100 open ended questions about my challenge before making any recommendations, and that each answer I provided should have its assumptions challenged with follow up questions. These conversations can sometimes take weeks to evolve. Those are my favorite ones that usually end up providing me with actionable information.

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially using AI as a thinking partner that challenges your assumptions over weeks of conversation. 

When you mention these extended conversations that can take weeks to evolve, what does that rhythm look like for you? Are you returning to these conversations daily, or is it more sporadic as ideas develop?

User: Yes, when I have a more complex challenge I'd like to solve, or am looking to develop long term strategies, I will schedule out an hour each day to work through the conversations I have set up. I continue to work on them until they have run their course, which is determined organically.

AI: So you've built this into your daily routine as dedicated thinking time. 

When you say a conversation has "run its course" and you determine that organically, what signals tell you that a particular strategic conversation with AI has reached that natural endpoint?

User: Usually it's just a gut feeling that I've squeezed the orange for all the juice I'm going to get. Practically speaking, it's when I feel like I have a good sense of the path forward and that continuing the conversation would be rudimentary or time wasting.

AI: That makes sense - trusting that instinct about when you've extracted the value you need.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you use it for these complex challenges, but are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Writing emails or solving personal challenges is not something that is appealing for me to use AI for. I get why some people do it, but I prefer to keep a personal touch in my communication with humans. To me, it's more about remaining grounded while also leaning into an exciting evolution of technology.

AI: That distinction between using AI for strategic thinking versus keeping that personal touch in human communication is really thoughtful.

When you're working through those complex strategic conversations with AI, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more collaborating back and forth throughout the process, or do you find yourself delegating specific pieces for the AI to work on independently?

User: It's a collaborative conversation. I set it up to feel like an expert consultation session, where the AI bot is an expert in the field and I am hiring it out to help me work through my thoughts and consider my challenges from angles or blindspots I may have not previously considered.

AI: I like that framing - setting it up like an expert consultation where you're the client working through your challenges together.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has their approach affected how you think about or use these tools?

User: I am typically the more advanced AI user in my circles of influence. A lot of established professionals are being culturally influenced to have reservations or fears about AI, which to me is shocking. Most of my conversations with colleagues on this topic are spent challenging them to enter the sandbox and explore how these amazing tools can be leveraged

AI: So you find yourself in more of an advocate or educator role with your colleagues. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My agency serves non profits and helps them with branding narrative and fundraising campaigns. One non profit I serve didn't have enough money to hire a grant writer, so I designed a custom bot for them to use internally to write grants. I have iterated it several times and it has been so much fun seeing this chatbot win grants for my client. It's not only saving them money they'd previously pay to contractors, but it's winning substantial grants for them.

AI: That's a great success story - creating real financial impact for your nonprofit client. The fact that it's actually winning grants shows the practical value of how you've designed that bot.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you're integrating these tools into your work?

User: AI "taking over" is not a way I like to frame AI's involvement in different genres. To develop ones skills in any given area where AI is going to be integrated within, needs to mean that you lean into AI and learn how to leverage it effectively. I share with colleagues all the time who are fearful of AI that, in my opinion, AI will not "take over" anyones job as much as it will take over the jobs of those who do those jobs poorly anyway. A graphic designer does not need to be afraid of AI taking over their job; instead, they need to see it as an incredible opportunity to expand their capacity. AI will only take bad graphic designers' jobs who are too rigid to evolve with the world.

So, to me, maintaining my skillset means maintaining my grounded approach to being personable with humans while constantly asking myself how AI can be leveraged as a tool to expand my profession's impact.

AI: That's a compelling perspective - viewing AI as an expansion tool rather than a threat, and focusing on evolution rather than replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you?

User: Within my specific profession, leveraging agentic models to perform custom long term projects or roles internally will be a huge focus. Also, my business does a lot of work in developing tech stacks and internal application systems to make non profit fundraising more effective and efficient. So, with that in mind, I'm looking to educate myself more and more on using models to create these applications and scripts more efficiently and more reliably.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on framing AI as a tool for expansion rather than replacement, and how you've created these week-long strategic thinking partnerships with AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic thinking partner and your approach to helping nonprofits leverage these tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
