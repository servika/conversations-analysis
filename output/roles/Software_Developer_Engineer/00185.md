Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, go ahead with the questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a software engineer intern, where I do both frontend and backend development. I use AI throughout my day and I am even encouraged and taught to by my senior engineers. When I am doing small tasks such as creating elements and tedious code for a mobile app, I use AI to help me generate the code for that. I also use ChatGPT to help me better understand different concepts as I learn and progress.

AI: That's really interesting that your senior engineers actively encourage and teach AI usage. 

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI for those code generation tasks? How do you usually approach it?

User: I was taught multiple methods to effectively use AI while working. For example, if I am developing a specific feature for a mobile app, I first ask AI to create a markdown file of the plan, required backend apis, files to create, functions to create, etc. I then edit and make iterations on the markdown file to exactly what I want, so I know exactly what will be implemented and have full control over it. Then, I ask the AI (e.g. Cursor) to implement the new feature based off of the markdown file. This strategy helps me control the AI's code so that there are no surprises and to make sure I fully understand everything the AI does.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - using the markdown planning phase to maintain control and understanding. 

Tell me more about that editing and iteration process on the markdown file. What kinds of changes do you typically find yourself making to the AI's initial plan?

User: Usually, when I ask an AI to develop a feature, there are many strategies and routes it could take. Asking the AI to create a markdown file to plan out a strategy before hopping straight to coding could help me control and make changes such as design changes, using different libraries, reusing existing APIs endpoints instead of creating new ones, etc.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that strategic overview before diving into implementation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Some tasks that I sometimes prefer to handle myself are braining storming new features or designing the UI, especially when collaborating with a team. Although I can use AI, I enjoy discussing and brainstorming potential ideas myself because it is something I am passionate about and find joy in doing so. Similarly, I find joy in designing the UI for apps on platforms such as Figma, so I tend to do it without AI sometimes, purely for my own satisfaction.

AI: That's really insightful - the distinction between tasks you find personally fulfilling versus ones you're happy to have AI assist with.

When you do use AI for work, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work back-and-forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: I find myself going back-and-forth with it throughout a task. I personally find it important to know what the AI code does exactly, especially when working with a team, thus I try to avoid giving the AI independent tasks.

AI: That back-and-forth approach sounds like it keeps you really engaged with the code. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned earlier that senior engineers encourage it - has that shaped your approach in specific ways?

User: Yes, my current workplace culture heavily influenced the way I use AI. It is an internship position, and so I get to learn a lot from my manager and senior engineers. One of which is how to effectively use AI and be on the driver seat when doing so. I was taught that taking advantage of AI can boost your productivity, using AI for more redundant tasks and using the time you save to spend on bigger problems. I was taught at my new internship to use AI agents in Cursor and viable strategies to use, which is something I started to find myself using outside of work in side projects.

AI: It sounds like this internship has really shaped your relationship with AI tools in a positive way.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: In the beginning of my internship, my manager advised me to play around with AI agents and make mistakes, before teaching me strategies. Initially, I was frustrated because the AI would write too much code, although I just asked for simple tasks. For example, asking the AI to help me fix a bug could change hundreds of lines of code, deleting older code and adding potentially unnecessary code. Later on, I got better at controlling the code that the AI writes, but initially there were some frustrations with too much code from the AI agents.

AI: That's a really vivid example of the learning curve - going from AI making overwhelming changes to you being able to control its scope better.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, it is something I consider. I was taught to make sure to always understand what the AI codes for me, even asking questions to clarify what is happening and why the AI is using certain methods I might not understand. Even though the code works as expected, not fully understanding the AI generated solutions could make me forget skills and potentially become worse of a developer overtime.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach to maintaining your development skills while leveraging AI's capabilities.

For my final question: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as you progress in your career?

User: I personally believe that AI is a tool that developers should use and take advantage of, and not doing so could put you behind other developers in terms of efficiency and productivity. I envision myself continuing to use AI at work as I progress in my career, hopefully using it to become a more efficient engineer as I grow.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that structured markdown planning approach - that seems like such a smart way to maintain control while leveraging AI's capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's it, thank you for the interview!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about learning to control AI's scope, the importance of understanding generated code, and how workplace culture can positively shape AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been great hearing about your journey from initial frustrations to developing such thoughtful strategies for working with AI. Best of luck with the rest of your internship!
