Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: It sounds good to me, I do not have any questions yet.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use AI to help in preparation for a shift, and effective communication with my fellow managers. I design training rubrics and guidelines, and models typically help me organize the content or clarify what I am trying to say. I also use AI to help create emails and presentations to share with my superiors and coworkers.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're in a management role where you're doing quite a bit of content creation and communication.

When you mention using AI to "organize the content or clarify what you are trying to say" - could you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you usually work with the AI to get from your initial ideas to the final training rubric or guideline?

User: For example, my company had a seasonal beverages and entree come out, so I had to make sure my team members knew how to sell or make the items, as well as what is in the items in case customers ask. I gave an AI model the description and summary of the items, and we brainstormed conversations and questions customers might have so that my team members could be prepared. We also made a PowerPoint by organizing key points into 3-4 sentence segments, slide by slide.

AI: That's a really concrete example, thank you. I'm curious about the brainstorming part you mentioned - when you and the AI were working through potential customer conversations and questions, how did that collaboration unfold? 

Were you bouncing ideas back and forth, or did you find yourself working together in a different way during that brainstorming process?

User: I usually come to my AI model with either incomplete ideas or ideas that I can't seem to formulate. The model helps me make these ideas fleshed out and clear. I think so fast that sometimes I can't express the countless ideas in my mind, so conversating with the model gives me a chance to streamline my ideas. We build off of each other's dialogue and the model listens to my feedback so we can create the best finished product possible.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like the AI serves as a thinking partner for you when your mind is moving faster than you can articulate. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your management role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks feel different to you?

User: I handle a lot of raw data myself- anything from temperature charts to customer satisfaction results, and I am responsible for inputting this data into tables for my team to understand easily. I wish my model could view this data and input it, but if I download my sheets of data it is a confusing layout and I handle computing this so that I know it is accurate.

AI: That makes sense - accuracy is clearly crucial when you're working with data that your team relies on. It sounds like you need that direct control and verification when it comes to data handling.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it seems like you're actively collaborating throughout tasks rather than just handing something off. Is that generally how you approach working with AI, or does it vary depending on the type of work you're doing?

User: While I mostly collaborate, I do delegate some tasks. Some emails I might give a few details for the content, but then I spend the majority of the conversation asking for edits to the model's draft. I also ask for opinions on job postings when needing an extra "ear" to listen.
I do enjoy having a level of control in the verification process, and to me it is easier to input it once with the knowledge that it is accurate vs inputting data into my model, then verifying truthfulness line by line.

AI: That control and verification aspect you mentioned is really interesting - especially how you weigh the effort of doing something once accurately versus the back-and-forth of verification.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself being open about using these tools, or has the workplace environment shaped your approach in any particular way?

User: I manage a historically conservative restaurant, and I think that sentiment is reflected in the majority of opinions towards AI. Most of them are scared of AI, to an extent-they're afraid it's going to steal jobs or hurt the environment. But my team members, particularly the younger ones, appreciate AI models and the ease of using one to formulate phrases to help memorize our conversation script, to streamline their conversations, as well as uses outside of work. I am not necessarily influenced by either opinion, but the owner of the restaurant has been more open and accepting of AI as of late, so it is fun helping to bridge the learning curve.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're navigating some pretty different perspectives on AI within your workplace. You mentioned it's "fun helping to bridge the learning curve" with the restaurant owner.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation that created that strong reaction?

User: A few months back I was tasked with creating a new position in our restaurant; a certified trainer. It was meant to be the first step in the leadership process, and while I had ideas and data, I couldn't put it all into an effective and persuasive argument. Exasperated, I reached out to my AI model, essentially word vomiting all of my ideas and concerns, with a request on how we could present this better. I went with one of the model's suggestions, a PowerPoint, and we took each idea and made them complete thoughts. By the time we were finished, I was so relieved, and it gave me a new respect for AI models. I began using it in the workplace more after that.

AI: That sounds like a pivotal moment for you - going from feeling stuck and exasperated to having a clear, persuasive presentation. It really illustrates that collaborative process you described earlier.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given your role in helping bridge that learning curve at your restaurant?

User: Honestly, AI helps me hone them. I realize the exponential growth in the artificial intelligence field, so I make sure I understand models to some extent while respecting their use as a tool. I think about it a lot, but given the conservative nature of the restaurant I do not think my position is in any jeopardy.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - using AI as a way to actually strengthen your skills rather than replace them.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops or as your workplace culture continues to shift?

User: I could see my own relationship strengthening with AI, but I want to stay mindful of not becoming dependent on it. I think in a way I am the trailblazer in my workplace with working with AI models, and I want to show a healthy relationship, as there are so many stories of people becoming too engrossed in  the models. Hopefully we implement more AI as a company, as I think that is a key component in our technology advancing.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being that trailblazer in your workplace while maintaining a healthy, collaborative relationship with AI rather than becoming dependent on it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I can not think of anything else, thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating different workplace attitudes toward AI, using it as a thinking partner for complex ideas, and maintaining that balance between collaboration and control will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the satisfying moments and the areas where you prefer to maintain direct control. Have a great rest of your day!
