Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here today as part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure! Recently, I've been using AI for a lot of refinement work and on tasks that are tedious and require a lot of heads down time. Specifically, I've been using AI to help refine PowerPoint wording to optimize impact statements, having it refine and summarize meeting notes to put into narrative fashion, wordsmith ing emails, and helping to refine other business communications. Additionally, I use it often to help summarize large bodies of text with key takeaways, to gut check my interpretation of data, and to help better understand industry trends and ways to problem solve newly identified industry problems. I've also used it to help edit and refine existing process documents and guidelines.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses. It sounds like you're leveraging AI across different types of communication and analysis work.

When you mention using it for "refinement work" - like with PowerPoint wording or email wordsmithing - what does that interaction typically look like? Are you starting with a draft and asking AI to polish it, or is there more back-and-forth involved?

User: We don't have the ability to have AI generate or update slides directly, so typically what I am doing is taking key phrases/sentences/passages that aren't quite hitting the message that I'm looking for and ask the AI to re word it, or make it more concise, or soften tone, etc etc. AI isn't generally creating documents/full work products from scratch for me.

AI: That's really interesting - so it sounds like you're maintaining control over the overall structure and content, but using AI as more of a precision tool for specific language choices.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: That's right! Definitely a refinement tool for me to optimize messaging at this point! I still prefer to write my emails myself, or to draft the main framework of process documents myself. These types of tasks are different because they require an additional degree of specialization/context than I feel like the AI has available to appropriately personalize. The models can't integrate a conversation into my email without me telling it about it, for example, so it doesn't make sense to have AI generate an email without the context to do so. Similarly, much of the processes we build are proprietary and/or relating to a net new product or initiative where there isn't necessarily information out there that I feel AI would be able to help with without an exorbitant amount of time spent outlining needs/constraints/context etc. In these cases, and other similar ones, it is more efficient for me to do the work.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're weighing the upfront investment of providing context against the benefit you'd get back. It sounds like you have a pretty clear sense of where that efficiency threshold lies.

When you do use AI for those refinement tasks we talked about earlier, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a specific piece to work on and then move on?

User: Right. Niche work makes some of generalized AI capabilities harder to apply. Sure.  Usually, I am simply taking a snippet or a paragraph, and asking the model to refine piece by piece vs a holistic overhaul of the document or item I am working. BUT there are instances where I've given it a broader task (I.e. summarize this information in the following way and in the following format) and have used the initial output to provide the framework, then go back and forth with several sets of refinement. I am more likely to use this method in large summarization efforts vs. refinement of emails or presentations etc.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - so for smaller refinements it's more of a one-off interaction, but for larger summarization work you're willing to invest in that iterative back-and-forth process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: Absolutely! In Team meetings we will share if one of us finds a good use case to bring AI in. I think we are all looking for ways to be more efficient, and AI is one of them. That said, there are certainly those users who are very unwilling to engage with AI because of their fear of obsolecence, so there is a large degree of variability with how often and when different employees are using AI.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's both collaboration and some hesitation coexisting in your workplace. The fear of obsolescence you mentioned is something I hear about.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. I was hosting an in person process event where we had done a lot of preparation work to develop some new guidelines that will be highly regulated, and as part of the pre work for that event, I was able to use AI to summarize all of my meeting notes into a cohesive summary from industry experts, then feed it to the working group who then took those outputs, created a framework, and then fed both to AI to create an initial draft of guidelines within minutes. This is something that would have taken HOURS to do with collating information from expert sources, internal experts, and broader general knowledge, so AI really accelerated delivery of an initial draft--even if that draft needs considerable edits.

AI: That sounds like a really powerful example of AI amplifying your team's work rather than replacing it. The fact that you could take expert input and quickly turn it into a working draft that your team could then build on seems like it really changed the dynamics of that process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's always front of mind. Ultimately, AI is still ARTIFICIAL intelligence, and subsequently, still makes mistakes, lacks context, and mis reads the required human touch and empathy needed to do things like effectively manage stakeholders. As a result, my aim is to continue to bring expertise in my domain while ALSO marrying that with those items AI is not yet able to integrate effectively. A key part of my work involves understanding behavioral influence over key metrics and managing people through informal authority and sway, so my efforts are focused on optimizing those areas while not getting complacent with my technical expertise.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - focusing on the distinctly human elements like stakeholder management and behavioral influence while staying sharp on the technical side. It sounds like you see it as complementary rather than competitive.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe that AI will continue to become an ever growing presence in my industry, and instead of pretending it doesn't exist, my plan is to embrace it and become an early adopter so that I can learn the boundaries of effective and ineffective utilization. AI will ultimately result in some reduction in workforce in my industry, but there will always be a need for truly critical thinking, so my plan is to continue to integrate It where it makes sense to.

AI: That's a really pragmatic perspective - being an early adopter to understand those boundaries of effective use rather than avoiding it altogether.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a refinement tool while maintaining control over strategy and context, and how you're actively thinking about preserving the distinctly human elements of your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope--thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that efficiency threshold, the collaborative workplace dynamics, and especially that example of the process event where AI helped accelerate your team's work - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
