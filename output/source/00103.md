Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I only use it occasionally - mainly to access a quick factual answer if I get stuck on something software related. This is normally when using a program such as Autodesk Maya. I have all used it to come up with creative ideas which I can then expand on.

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like you're using AI more as a quick reference tool and creative springboard rather than for ongoing tasks. 

When you say you use it to come up with creative ideas that you then expand on, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? What kind of creative work are you doing, and how do you take those initial AI-generated ideas and develop them further?

User: I have used this when an idea or project work is too complicated or will take too long - usually when making an asset as part of a project. Coming up with ideas for an effective and similar asset can be difficult when I have a visual in my head - AI can help to simplify things and provide a few different options quickly. I also recently used it for new ideas when creating an interior design visual, as most accessible examples are very similar and I was looking to add something different to the space.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to break through creative blocks and generate options when you need to move past similar-looking examples. 

Tell me more about that interior design visual project. When you say most accessible examples are very similar, what was it about the AI-generated ideas that helped you add something different? How did you know which suggestions to pursue versus which ones to set aside?

User: This was the inside of a hotel, with a lot of focus on lighting and a task to provide various ideas for the space (within quite strict limitations). The model was able to come up with ideas that wouldn't be seen on a Google search (when prompted with the correct instructions). From a list of AI suggestions, there is normally only one or two that are realistically feasible for a project like this so it is easy to know what can be pursued and what wont work.

AI: That's really insightful - so you're able to quickly filter the AI suggestions through your own project knowledge and constraints to identify what's actually feasible.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it occasionally for quick answers and creative brainstorming. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, it's quick and easy to decide what will work based on the human conversations that have already taken place around each project, or specific instructions that have been sent over. IU down think AI would be very useful for

AI: It sounds like you were about to mention something AI wouldn't be very useful for - could you finish that thought? I'm curious to hear what types of tasks you feel are better handled without AI assistance.

User: Sorry - I dont think AI would be very useful for most of the other work that I do. It isn't yet capable of using or helping with specific software, such as Maya, ZBrush, Rhino etc, other than offering a potential solution when stuck on an issue. The actual work still has to be done manually by a human in order to be accurate.

AI: That's a really important distinction - the hands-on technical work in those specialized software programs still requires your direct expertise and manual execution.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask it a specific question and then take that answer and work independently from there?

User: Ask a specific question only. Occasionally there will be a follow up question but very rarely a full conversation

AI: Got it - so you're using AI more like a targeted consultation rather than an ongoing collaboration.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others around you are using it differently, or is there any particular attitude toward AI tools in your workplace?

User: The attitude towards it is generally negative as it does threaten jobs within the industry. If AI can improve in terms of creating realistic 3D visuals then a lot of jobs may be lost. There are already less people being hired to entry level positions. I dont think many colleagues use AI on a regular basis

AI: That's a really honest perspective - it sounds like there's a real tension between the potential utility of AI and genuine concerns about its impact on employment in your field.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It did provide a quick solution to a mesh issue that would have taken me ours to work out alone, or at least an hour to find on Google. Normally it wouldn't be as immediately helpful and would just provide some inspiration for things I could try that I may not have thought of, when experiencing an issue

AI: That mesh issue sounds like a great example of AI being genuinely useful - saving you significant time on a technical problem.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? You mentioned concerns about AI creating realistic 3D visuals - is this something you actively consider as you develop your career?

User: Yes, I plan to start changing my career over the next year

AI: That's a significant decision. Can you tell me more about what's driving that career change? Is it primarily the concern about AI's impact on your current field, or are there other factors influencing your thinking about moving in a different direction?

User: It is mainly AI - lots of companies are letting people go and many are not hiring in the numbers they used to. This is partly due to some changes during the covid pandemic but it is also influenced by new technology. I imagine AI will be able to do a lot of the work within 5 years

AI: That's a really significant shift to be navigating. Given everything you've shared about the current state of your industry and your plans to transition careers, how do you envision your relationship with AI evolving as you move forward - both in your current work over the next year and potentially in whatever field you move into next?

User: I dont plan to use AI much more than I do currently - I think it has its place and it's interesting to learn how it works. It has been useful for answering questions and providing ideas in both my personal life and my career but I dont think I will use it for anything other than factual questions etc in my next career either

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective on how AI is affecting hiring and employment in your field, and how that's influencing your career decisions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No,  I think that covers everything

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a targeted tool for specific problems, the real workplace concerns about employment impacts, and how that's shaping career decisions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candid perspective on both the practical benefits and the broader industry challenges. Take care!
