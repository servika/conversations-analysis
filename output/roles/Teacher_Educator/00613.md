Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope. I'm ready to begin,

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in education in an SLLD/Life Skills classroom. I work with middle school aged students on the Autism Spectrum. They have significant communication deficits and their academic levels are well below their age and grade level. They are very bright and intelligent, but the challenge is being able to facilitate their ability to show what they know. I use AI to create specific picture prompts because there are not a lot of materials readily available for students that are our age and academic level. Most of it is very babyish and suited to preschoolers, kindergarteners, or first / second grade.

AI: That's fascinating - you're addressing such a specific and important gap in educational materials. 

Tell me more about creating these picture prompts. What does that process look like when you're working with AI to develop them?

User: I typically start with a skill that i'm trying to target. The most recent was prepositions. Our students have difficulty with using in, on , behind, in front, etc correctly. I like to create digital materials that the students can interact with on a Smart Board or chromebook (with touch screen). I'll send a prompt that describes the kind of picture that I need. For example, something like, "Generate a cartoon image of a middle school aged boy riding a horse in a grassy field." Then I get an image. If I like it, I download it and save it to use in the materials. If something needs to be altered, I send a follow up prompt to tweak the image until it suits my needs.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful process. When you're tweaking those images with follow-up prompts, what kinds of adjustments do you typically find yourself making? What details matter most for your students?

User: Sometimes there are odd anatomical inconsistencies, or some other element that is wrong, like the horse is floating in the air, or the boy has one hand, something like that. Other times, it will be that the boy in the image looks too young, or has the wrong expression on his face, like he looks sad or mad. I'll send follow up prompts to try and guide the model to a better image.

AI: I can see how those details would be really important for your students - having age-appropriate characters and clear, logical scenes. 

When you think about this work of creating these materials, are there parts of the process you prefer to handle yourself rather than having AI help with, even though it technically could assist with those aspects?

User: For image generation, I prefer AI to help. I could use programs to draw or create images myself, but it is so much easier and faster to have AI generate higher quality images than I could ever make.  I also need a lot of images for each skill so that I can assess a lot of different variables. That would take me forever without AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the volume and quality needs you have would make that incredibly time-consuming without AI.

When you're working with AI to create these materials, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the entire process of making the materials, or do you tend to delegate the image generation part and then handle other aspects independently?

User: I tend to delegate the image generation, then create the digital materials, sometimes Boom Learning cards, sometimes Google Slides, myself. Usually some kind of written prompt with multiple choice answers, tap to choose or click and drag.

AI: That's really helpful to understand - so you've got this clear division where AI handles the image creation and you design the interactive learning experience around those images.

How have your colleagues or your school's culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any particular reaction or guidance around incorporating these tools?

User: The materials are overwhelmingly well received. The images are rich and engaging, and the materials that I create with them are easy to understand and easily customizable so that we can target specific learning goals quickly and easily.

AI: That's wonderful that they've been so well received! It sounds like you've found a really effective approach.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was very satisfied at the end of last school year (it's currently September, the beginning of a new school year) I used AI to create a batch of images to work on main ideas. I used the AI for writing short paragraphs to go with the images for that one. I created a Boom Deck and was able to engage students and have them practice looking at the images, reading the short text, and choosing the main idea for each set.  One thing that is super frustrating to me is that when creating Boom Learning cards, they have explicitly forbidden the use  of AI generated images when putting decks up for sale in their stores. I don't understand why.

AI: That satisfaction with seeing your students engage with those main idea materials really comes through - it sounds like a great success! 

The Boom Learning restriction is interesting and I can understand your frustration, especially when the materials are working so well for your students. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. I know a lot of people are concerned about AI taking jobs, musicians, artists, etc. I think that the musicians and artists who learn to leverage AI and evolve with it will be the successful ones in the future. I think that coming up with ways to let AI enhance whatever we are attempting to do can only benefit.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on evolving with the technology rather than seeing it as competition.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or are you pretty satisfied with how you're incorporating it now?

User: I'd like for entities like Boom Learning to come to some acceptance of the use of AI and let people create and share/sell richer and more engaging learning materials. I've used AI to help me make middle school age appropriate social stories to use with my students. I'd like to do more of that. Right now there is a definite lack of age AND academic appropriate materials for kids that I work with. I think that AI is a bridge to creating the needed content quickly.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI is helping you fill such a critical gap in age-appropriate materials for your students, and your view on evolving with the technology rather than being displaced by it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: This already kind of exists, but I think that MAP testing could evolve and get better. Online testing that adjusts to the learner's answers to keep the work challenging but within their abilities.

AI: That's a really insightful point about adaptive testing - especially given your experience working with students who have such varied abilities and needs. The idea of AI helping assessments become more responsive and appropriately challenging for each individual learner makes a lot of sense.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI to create specialized educational materials and fill gaps in existing resources will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's clear you're doing important work for your students.
