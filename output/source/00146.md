Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a freelance software developer. I mainly make web and mobile apps. I use code claude for rapid prototyping

AI: That's interesting - rapid prototyping is such a key part of development work. 

Tell me more about that. What does your rapid prototyping process look like when you're using Code Claude?

User: I build out the web app from scratch by typing in each step in the claude code terminal. Then I periodically check to make sure everything is right

AI: So you're working step by step through the terminal, building incrementally and checking your progress along the way. 

What draws you to that approach rather than, say, asking Claude to build larger chunks at once?

User: I've tried to use claude to build everything at once. It highly unlike that'll it'll work and can take longer to debug than building everything incrementally. And then it's still going to have problems with it

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've learned through experience that the incremental approach actually saves you time in the long run, even though it might seem slower upfront.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I've tried to get AI to do just about everything. But I still test the app myself

AI: Interesting - so testing is something you keep in your own hands. 

What is it about the testing process that makes you want to handle that part yourself rather than delegating it to AI?

User: It's the most crucial part in determining if the app works and AI is too likely to say it works when it doesn't

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the reliability factor when it comes to quality assessment.

When you are using Claude for your development work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I give it the complete task. If I catch it making a mistake I'll delegate

AI: So you start by delegating the complete task, but then shift into more of a collaborative mode when you spot issues that need correction.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you're freelancing, how do your clients factor into how you approach using AI?

User: My colleague also use AI. It doesn't change the way I use it. I don't like to tell the clients because then they think they can do everything themselves

AI: That's a really candid perspective - the concern that clients might underestimate the complexity of what you do if they know AI is involved.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There been several times when AI has tried to do things the wrong way and even after guiding it, it'll insist on doing things the way it was trying to

AI: That sounds really frustrating - when you're trying to guide it toward the right approach but it keeps reverting back to its original method.

Can you think of a specific example where this happened? What was the task, and what was AI insisting on doing differently from what you knew was the right way?

User: I was righting an app for displaying all the musical scales. AI tried to derivate the notes programmatically but there are so many random rules like double sharps that I knew it was best to just hardcode the notes

AI: Ah, that's a perfect example - music theory has all those edge cases and exceptions that seem logical to hardcode, but AI kept trying to solve it algorithmically even when you knew from experience that wouldn't work cleanly.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it's better to become a generalist in more areas now than an expert in one

AI: That's a really thoughtful strategy - broadening your skillset rather than going deep in just one area.

What's driving that thinking for you? How do you see that generalist approach serving you as AI capabilities continue to evolve?

User: If I have basic knowledge of something I can use AI in more areas

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that foundational knowledge across different areas gives you the context to effectively guide and collaborate with AI in more domains.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope AI will get better than I can use it more efficiently. I don't plan on stopping using it

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on becoming a generalist to better leverage AI across different areas, and your practical approach to testing - keeping that crucial quality control in your own hands.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Sometimes AI will be willing to do something one day like make system level changes and then it won't the next day

AI: That's a really interesting observation - the inconsistency in what AI is willing to tackle from day to day. That kind of unpredictability must make it challenging to rely on for certain types of work.

Do you have any sense of what might be driving those differences, or is it just something you've learned to work around?

User: I think it's the creators trying to make AI more secure

AI: That makes sense - security updates and policy changes happening behind the scenes that affect what the AI will and won't do.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of working with AI - from the incremental development approach to dealing with inconsistent capabilities - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thanks

AI: You're very welcome! I really appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences. Have a great rest of your day!
