Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, that sounds fine.

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI daily at work. Mainly I use it to help write or revise emails messages, help me research items I'm trying to learn more about, help me learn different software programs better or provide suggestions on how to implement those programs into my tasks to gain efficiency.

AI: That's a nice range of uses. When you mention using AI to help you learn software programs better - can you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: I may ask it what programs are available to help me accomplish a certain task, or if I'm already familiar with a program I will ask AI to walk me through executing a more complex task.

AI: When AI walks you through those more complex tasks in software programs, how do you usually work through that process? Do you follow along step-by-step with AI guiding you, or do you have it map out the whole approach first and then work independently?

User: I usually follow step by step so I can ask clarifying questions or alert the AI when a specific step isn't working

AI: That's really helpful to understand. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: It is more common that there are tasks I cannot yet have AI complete than tasks that it can complete and I choose not to have AI do them because I prefer to.

AI: That's an interesting distinction. Can you give me an example of a task where AI just can't quite handle what you need it to do? What usually gets in the way?

User: I think most frequently gets in the way is the version of the AI program that my employer allows. There may be functionality that exists but our particular license does not allow. Things like agentic AI

AI: I see - so it's often about access limitations rather than the AI's capabilities themselves. When you do have access to the AI tools your employer provides, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I believe our culture is accepting of AI, but there is a lot of emphasis on data protection and still double checking the information provided by AI to confirm accuracy

AI: That emphasis on data protection and verification makes a lot of sense. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: An example of being frustrated was when I was using AI to try to accomplish a specific task in Power Automate and the instructions AI was providing was not working but the AI just kept providing a loop of the same instructions or suggestions, forgetting it had already provided that information and the information I had provided regarding it not working.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - getting stuck in that loop where it's not remembering what you've already tried. When that happens, what do you typically do to move forward with the task?

User: I may close out of the conversation and start over, try again later, or find alternative ways to get the information not utilizing AI

AI: That makes sense. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes I do actively consider it. I choose not to atrophy skills even if I think it is likely AI may completely take them over at some point. However, I also try to be aware of including development it may be less likely to take over, or take over as quickly

AI: Can you give me an example of a skill you're intentionally maintaining even though AI might handle it, and maybe one you're developing that you think AI is less likely to take over?

User: Microsoft Excel functions, formulas, macros, etc. are skills I still work to maintain that I believe in the near future AI will be able to take over almost completely. Gaining nuanced knowledge of my business and our processes, that may or may not be explicitly documented somewhere is an example of knowledge AI is less likely to be involved in as immediately

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - the distinction between technical skills versus that deep institutional knowledge. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine it will continue to become more and more engrained into my daily work and understanding the various options available and best ways to utilize them will be increasingly important

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on intentionally maintaining skills while also strategically developing knowledge that's harder for AI to replicate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I am good.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating workplace AI limitations, dealing with those frustrating loops, and your strategic approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
