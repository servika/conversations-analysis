Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm someone who works in SEO. I transitioned from freelance writing, so it was a natural pivot with AI looming. For some clients, I use AI to make quick Instagram captions based on images I share. I also use it to create local service area pages for small businesses.

For example, I have an exterminator company I work with. I structured pages like so:

Service-areas/saint-james/ant.

Would repeat this for each service in that area with internal linking and some facts about the town. Stuff like that. I also use it for my writing tasks as well. I don't use it for blog content, but I help it structure blog posts for me. I also use it to review spelling and things like that.

I've also used it to help with some coding, "Vibe Coding" you could call it. I build some WordPress sites for clients, and I'll use it for CSS. I also use it to assist with troubleshooting.

AI: That's a really practical range of uses across different parts of your SEO work. You mentioned you don't use AI for blog content itself, but you do have it help structure blog posts. 

Can you tell me more about that distinction? What makes you comfortable using AI for structuring but not for the actual content creation?

User: I work for two different marketing agencies. I make pretty good money writing for them (freelance), but they're against AI content. They only allow me to structure blog posts with it. One agency terminated someone for using it blatantly, so it's a bit taboo right now.

AI: That's really interesting - you're navigating these different workplace policies around AI use. 

When you're working on your own SEO projects versus these agency clients, how does that difference in rules affect the way you approach your work? Do you find yourself thinking differently about tasks when you know AI is or isn't an option?

User: Yes, definitely do. When it's my own work, sometimes I rely on it for full content creation, like the service pages. Then, I can A/B test the content via search console to see how well it ranks. From there, I can make my own judgements about it. 

It also enables me to do the work I do for the agencies at a smaller scale for local businesses at a cheaper price, and for less time.

AI: That's a fascinating way to think about it - using your own projects as testing grounds to learn what works. 

When you're doing that A/B testing with AI-generated content versus your own writing, what have you discovered? Are there patterns in what performs better or worse?

User: I've mostly tested the AI content for service area pages. I've done some blog content for a dental consulting firm in NYC, and I've had some success there. I'm not charging them a lot, so I can't dedicate as much time to handwritten content. The service area pages rank very well, but it depends on the competition and the service area (if that makes sense).

AI: That makes complete sense - the competition and local market dynamics would definitely impact how well any content performs.

When you're creating those service area pages with AI, are you typically giving it very detailed prompts and then using what it produces, or do you find yourself going back and forth with it - more of a collaborative process where you're refining and adjusting as you go?

User: I have projects with instructions set up in ChatGPT that offer some general content rules. I'm a Plus user. 

Then, I'll start a conversation and go back and forth until we have a solid page done. Then, I'll give it the next town or area and it gives me the same content but for that town. The back and forth does take around a half hour or so to get right, but that could be me being picky. Despite the mass production, I still want these pages to be unique.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really thoughtful - spending that time to get it right even though you're scaling across multiple areas. 

You mentioned wanting the pages to be unique despite the mass production aspect. What does that back-and-forth process look like when you're trying to achieve that balance? What are you typically refining or pushing back on?

User: For local pages, I'll ask for more details about the town. I'll start with a shell of headings that I like, sometimes work on some graphics, and then see what it produces.

Then, I like to focus on specific details for each town. For example, Saint James has the famous General Store (Saint James, NY, if that helps for clarification). If the model doesn't include this, I'll push back for a blurb about it.

AI: That's a really smart approach - using those local landmarks and details to make each page genuinely relevant to that specific area. 

When you're pushing back for details like the General Store in Saint James, how reliable do you find AI at incorporating those kinds of specific local knowledge? Do you often have to provide that information yourself, or does it surprise you with what it knows?

User: Sometimes it does a good job, but other times it may make some small mistakes or not mention something I want. Of course, I have to go through and ensure that it's getting street names right and other key details. I would say I don't trust it fully there yet. But as an editor/writer, that's part of my process anyway.

AI: That editing mindset makes a lot of sense - treating it as another draft that needs your professional review. 

Thinking about all the different ways you use AI in your work - from those local pages to Instagram captions to CSS help - is there a particular type of task where you feel most satisfied or confident about the collaboration? Where does it feel like the best fit for how you like to work?

User: I definitely feel the most satisfied with Instagram captions. I can create instructions, provide an image, and the caption is solid. Service area pages are good, but sometimes they need some tweaks. Coding is hit or miss, but to be honest, that could be because of my lack of coding knowledge. As someone who has very little, it's still much better than I am. 

When I have it review things like whether or not UK English is present in my text, I wish it wouldn't ramble sometimes and try to recommend other changes. But I usually cut it off and it fixes itself, that's probably my biggest gripe. I'll also say that's it been a lot more efficient at helping me solve WordPress problems, server problems, and other websites issues compared to Google search. I don't know that I'd be able to effectively help my clients quickly without it.

AI: That efficiency gain for troubleshooting is really striking - being able to solve client issues quickly rather than digging through search results.

When you think about maintaining your own skills in areas where AI is helping you so much - like the coding work or even the content creation - is that something you actively think about? Do you worry about getting rusty, or do you see it more as freeing you up to focus on other areas?

User: Luckily, many of the agencies I write for don't allow AI directly in the work, so I can keep up with my writing skills. The real worry there is the value of the skill, like will it be gone soon? In other areas, AI has helped me expand into SEO rapidly. I'm also getting a lot better at reading and editing code. 

It's almost like how if you plop someone down in Italy for a long time, eventually they'll pick up on the language. While I don't know how to write a lot of code from scratch, I can read it and edit it myself once it's written. Does that make sense? I'm curious to see how that continues to grow.

AI: That language immersion analogy is brilliant - you're developing a kind of fluency through exposure and editing rather than starting from scratch. That's a really interesting way to think about skill development alongside AI.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Are you thinking it'll stay roughly the same as it is now, or do you see it changing as the technology develops or as workplace attitudes shift?

User: For writing, it will likely turn into editing work in the future. For my SEO business, it seems like that will grow, and I imagine I'll find new ways to remain competitive with AI. I've experimented with building sites from scratch compared to using page builders, so that's already starting to happen. 

I imagine in 5 to 10 years I'll be a one-man agency with a few competent AI agents that handle tasks for me. While scary, the potential is certainly interesting because I imagine many businesses will still want to focus on their business rather than the marketing.

AI: That vision of becoming a one-man agency with AI agents handling different tasks is really compelling - and it sounds like you're already testing the foundations for that with your experiments.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using your own projects as testing grounds and that language immersion analogy for developing coding skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating different workplace policies, using AI as a scaling tool, and that collaborative approach to content creation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing how you're thinking strategically about both the immediate practical applications and the longer-term evolution of your work with AI. Thanks again!
