Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me, I dont have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as an engagement specialist for the mental wellbeing department of a large insurance company. People will call in seeking mental health or community resources. I might use AI to search for community resources quickly based on information the member has provided. If a member shares that they are looking to speak with a counselor on a specific topic I may utilize AI to search for providers in their area that have experience in that topic.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work you're doing. When you're using AI to search for those community resources or providers, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically interact with the AI tool to get the information you need?

User: Sure lets say a member requests we look for a provider with experience in** **Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) I could open up an AI and ask it to think longer, search web resources, or deep research, I would then put in the members city asking for providers with experience in EMDR. In another example I might ask the AI to generate a list of free clinics the member might be eligible for in their local area. AI also assists in things such as finding homeless shelters, food banks, etc. Typically I use it when a member requests immediate resources

AI: That's really helpful to understand. It sounds like you're using AI when members need resources right away during the call. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: We have internal tools that let us see more common distinctions between counselors. For example if we wanted to view only marriage counselors, or Christian counselors we have easy tools to filter that out. If the member wants an older female who works with high stress professionals with a non-denominational approach AI can step in to help narrow down the field. Ultimately our goal is to the assist the members to the best of our ability as efficiently as possible. AI is great at handling more complex nuanced tasks.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using your internal tools for straightforward filters but turning to AI when the member's needs are more complex or nuanced.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Usually it would be a more collaborative approach. Since I am typically searching while a member is on the phone with me, I can give the AI real time information to consider to help narrow down a members specific requests

AI: That real-time collaboration sounds really dynamic - being able to feed the AI new information as you're learning more about what the member needs during the call.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My supervisor has taken the approach in discussions with us that AI is going to be integrated into our job, not as a complete replacement, but as a supplementary tool to best assist the member. Because of this its important to stay ahead of the curve so to speak in making sure we use AI resources ethically, responsibly, and within privacy guidelines as laid out by HIPPA, etc.

AI: That's interesting that your supervisor is being proactive about AI integration while emphasizing the ethical and privacy considerations. It sounds like there's organizational support for learning how to use these tools responsibly.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Certainly, there is some level of fear regarding the ability of AI to replace my current role entirely. I do intake, I gather the members information, listen with empathy to what they are currently struggling with. Sometimes I can complete the call myself, other times I pass the call onto one of our internal licensed counselors, or other legal/financial resources. We heard a demo where an AI rep took a call and it was virtually indistinguishable from talking to a "real" person. So certainly there is that fear/frustration that AI may be able to replace our role entirely.

AI: That's a really honest and understandable concern - hearing a demo where AI sounded so human-like in a role similar to yours would definitely be unsettling. It sounds like the empathy and human connection you bring to these calls is something you value about your work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I like to think that the human aspect in my role is something that shouldnt be replaced, even though I am not a counselor myself I am the first line of contact and set the tone for the member's additional interactions with our program. Some people might feel insulted that AI is feigning empathy/sympathy. Its a difficult balance to find when you're dealing with mental health and such personal topics. Ultimately I think the best way to use AI in a field such as mine is to supplement as I have been doing. AI is making incredible leaps in assuming a human persona though with realistic interactions.

AI: You've raised such an important point about the authenticity of empathy in mental health contexts - that some people might feel insulted by AI feigning those emotions when they're sharing something so personal.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: One way that AI might evolve our work would be in the data input, if AI is able to populate information quickly based on what it hears in the call. (First, last name, DOB, Address, employer, etc.) This allows the representative to be able to focus on the heart of the matter, which is finding out what the members needs are and how we can accommodate them.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - using AI to handle the administrative data entry so you can focus fully on understanding the member's actual needs and providing that human connection.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the balance between using AI as a supplement while preserving the authentic human connection that's so crucial in mental health support.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I dont think so

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining that essential human element in mental health support will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating these tools into such sensitive and important work. Take care!
