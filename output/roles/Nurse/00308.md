Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here as part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. 

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's have the first question.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a supervisor for an ambulance company. I work both on an ambulance and in an office. When I am on an ambulance I use AI in order to get background on medical conditions of patients that I am transporting. We don't do EMS type of calls, we transport patients who are already in the system with issues that have already been investigated. Sometimes this requires special information related to their issues. I also use AI to double check things like medic math and applications related to running medications or investigating the components of those medications.
Secondly, I work in an office and have used AI to help design protocols and feedback for employee tasks. I most recently used AI to design a one-on-one feedback survey regarding monthly inventory checks done on our ambulance fleet.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across such different aspects of your work. 

Tell me more about when you're using AI to get background on medical conditions during patient transport. What does that interaction typically look like in the moment?

User: Typically I get information from a nurse regarding the patient. We try to sort out the essentials together before transfer of care. Sometimes a patient is on a lot of medications...some of which I am unfamiliar with. So I use AI to educate myself during the transport of the patient.
Sometimes the patient provides information during transport that I have to investigate using AI.
It's a great resource for education and information.
In terms of medic math I might use AI to calculate IV rates needed for total volume of fluids running or something like that. Usually AI helps with background information though rather than tactical or practical day-to-day operations.

AI: So it sounds like AI is serving as an educational resource during those transports. When a patient mentions something unfamiliar or you encounter medications you don't know, you're turning to AI for that background knowledge.

I'm curious - are there certain medical situations or types of information where you prefer to rely on your own knowledge and experience, even though AI could potentially help?

User: Anything EMS related or acute changes in the patient would default to me doing what I know. AI is best used when I know I don't know and need the information or background. If I am slightly unsure or am doing something I haven't done in awhile I might use AI to help double check. This is all predicated on the situation not being an emergency though.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing a clear line between emergency situations where you rely on your training and experience, versus non-emergency situations where AI can serve as that educational backup.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have back-and-forth conversations with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: When I use AI in the back of an ambulance I use it as a granular search engine basically. I'm not looking for advice or conversation, I'm looking for answers that are concrete. Like what is Synthroid and what conditions would lead to a 100mcg daily dose...for example. Any conversation that takes place would just be me seeking clarity.

AI: So in the ambulance, you're using it more like a targeted lookup tool - getting specific factual information quickly rather than having extended discussions.

What about when you're working in the office side of your role - like when you were designing that feedback survey for inventory checks? How did your interaction with AI work differently in that context?

User: In those cases I am collaborating with AI and trying to get projects or write-ups to be effective and high quality. I am looking for advice both on content and design. I got the AI to help me design a survey based on questions I needed answered by staff, so the AI was able to give me a layout and design that looked good and covered everything I needed. It also offered a hierarchical ordering that made the meeting more powerful in terms of presentation.

AI: That's really interesting - so your approach shifts quite a bit depending on the context. In the ambulance it's more like quick factual queries, but in the office you're actually collaborating with AI on design and structure.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently than the people around you?

User: I work with very young medics, for most of them this is their first job and it's a stepping stone to working on an EMS ambulance. So we're talking 19-25 year-olds. They have been using AI since high school in many cases.
I don't see a lot of quality in terms of how they are using AI. In their case they seem to use it as a dodge or a shortcut. I get AI resignation letters that are no different then cutting and pasting a form letter online.

AI: That's a really striking contrast - you're using AI as a targeted educational tool and for collaboration, while you're seeing your younger colleagues use it more as a way to avoid putting in their own effort.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It was frustrating to some extent putting together the survey, because I had trouble fine tuning the design. Despite my inputs I was getting the same thing returned. It wasn't until I called out the lack of change that change was effected.
Honestly though it was a small complaint. AI rarely let's me down and the small complaints are so trivial compared to alternatives like trying to do everything from scratch in Microsoft Word or looking up specific information on Google about a medications and then trying to find specifically what I need from the listed sites....it's truly amazing.

AI: That frustration with the survey design makes sense - it sounds like you had to be pretty direct about what wasn't working before AI adjusted its approach.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't believe AI will impact paramedicine in terms of jobs. The mechanics of ambulances and stretchers and moving people into and out of houses and hospitals are too tactile and offer too many varieties of challenges. There is also the element of liability for all of this. Also, emergency situations are messy and require speed and flexibility. I don't see AI having a huge negative impact with EMS.
If anything AI will make paramedics way better. Safety features on driving ambulances will get better (assuming full automation of driving is still at least ten years out). Making equipment and diagnostic related equipment better is an obvious advantage, especially regarding AED and Lifepack gear.
I think AI will also have the potential to help train and education EMS providers to a much higher standard using scenario software and dummies for practice.
AI will be a much worse threat in replacing doctors I suspect. Radiologists are already obsolete if not for the protection of inertia in the system.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you see AI enhancing paramedic work rather than replacing it, especially given all the physical and unpredictable elements of what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as the technology develops?

User: I think those who chose to embrace it will prosper and benefit. By the time it starts naturally showing up everywhere it will be too late to take the most advantage of it. In terms of paramedicine it is going to make figuring out patient conditions much faster and easier. This will result in better patient outcomes. 
EMS relies on TRANSPORTATION, COMMUNICATION, and INTERVENTION. All three of these is going to be massively impacted by the rise of AI. What I'm doing myself right now is just the beginning.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI differently in emergency versus non-emergency situations, and your view that early adopters will have significant advantages.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both an educational tool and collaborative partner, while maintaining clear boundaries around when to rely on your own expertise, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
