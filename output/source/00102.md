Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use AI for content creation for my company's website and social media accounts for the purposes of marketing. I also will use AI to help organize the tasks I have each week and have on a couple of occasions used AI to brainstorm marketing ideas.

AI: That's helpful context - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your marketing workflow. 

When you're creating content for your website and social media, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you and the AI work together on those pieces?

User: The business I run is a cidery/winery and as part of our business we attend wine festivals and craft fairs put on by others. When I'm updating the website's Events page where all these events are listed I will give the AI the name of the event, date, time, location, and then I will feed in the event description posted by the host of the event from Facebook or their website. If this isn't available I'll include a brief description of the event including who is hosting it and the general vibe. The AI will then take all of the information provided and come up with a brief event 'blurb' which will appear on the Events page and a longer description that will appear on the page of that particular event on our site. I then copy and past the generated content, proofread and edit, and move on to the next event. I update the website approximately once a week in this way.

I also use an AI to come up with the copy for facebook and instagram posts for our business. I like to have at least one post scheduled every day of the week. I will give the AI which product is on sale for the coming week, what events are going on over the coming weekend, and any other topics I want to have addressed during the week, such as promoting grocery stores carrying our products. The AI will then come up with seven days' worth of posts. I then create graphics to go with the posts, copy and paste the generated text, proofread and edit as necessary, and schedule the posts for the week.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - thank you for walking me through that. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach where you provide the raw information and AI helps structure it into the right format for different platforms.

When you're proofreading and editing the content that AI generates, what kinds of changes do you typically find yourself making? What does the AI get right versus what needs your touch?

User: The AI tends to get overly repetitive, using the same structure for every event description or post. Sometimes it gets information wrong, particularly regarding dates. It will also sometimes over-emphasize a point, like mentioning the product we have for sale on our website in every single post, including those relating to our wholesale partnerships or events we're attending where it doesn't quite fit.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a good sense of where AI excels and where it needs human oversight. The repetitive structure and contextual missteps you mention seem like common patterns.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your marketing work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I tend to decide what to focus on each week which I'm sure is something I could use AI to decide for me. I will write shorter pieces of copy on my own just because it's faster than writing out a prompt, getting a response, and then editing it. I also come up with the graphics to go with social media posts on my own. I have had AI generate ideas for graphics in the past but it was a lot of suggestions of using collages and in general not very good.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - especially about the shorter copy where the prompt and editing process would take longer than just writing it yourself. 

When you do use AI for the longer content pieces and weekly planning, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with the AI to refine what you're looking for, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and then work with whatever it produces?

User: I tend to give it all the information up front. Then I take what's generated and work through that. If a post for a particular day is very different from what I'm looking for I'll have it rewrite that particular post. I very rarely have to have all of the posts rewritten.

AI: That's a really efficient approach - sounds like you've found a good balance between giving comprehensive initial instructions and making targeted adjustments when needed.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned running the cidery/winery, I'm curious whether you're making these decisions independently or if there are other perspectives that shape how you approach AI.

User: My husband and I run the business for the most part. I adopted AI into my workflows before he did but he will use AI now when making posts for Facebook or event descriptions for Facebook. He is less tech savvy than I am and doesn't understand AI as well but it seems to work well enough for him. The tone of his posts doesn't always match what I post because we're not using the same account to generate the copy, but I don't think that differs more than it would anyway being two different people making posts. We're a very small business and I don't believe our other employees who do office work utilize AI. I would hesitate to suggest it to them as they're older and I think their steeper learning curve wouldn't be worth the disruption to their work.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - it sounds like you've taken the lead on integrating AI and your husband has followed your example, even with different comfort levels with the technology.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: About a month ago I had the AI I was working with start to really struggle with dates and times and start to confuse details of events after doing a really good job for several weeks. I usually try to keep my social media post creation all in the same 'conversation'. The copy that was being generated wasn't usable which was of course frustrating. Since I know a little bit about how AI works what I did at that point was have the AI write a prompt for me to use to start a new conversation. I read over what it generated, made a few tweaks, and then opened up a fresh conversation with the same model and gave it the generated prompt. It then started working properly again to create content in the format I preferred but was no longer getting its dates and details confused. I imagine that if I knew less about using AI I would have been incredibly frustrated and would not known what to do when things started going wrong.

AI: That's a really smart solution - using the AI to help you create a better prompt for a fresh conversation. It sounds like your understanding of how AI works really paid off in that moment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider when deciding what to delegate versus what to keep doing yourself?

User: I don't like writing copy and don't mind having the AI take over that part of the job. If I get rusty I don't care. Although, I think editing the responses does help keep it fresh for me. If there's brainstorming to be done I will sometimes use an AI to generate a list of ideas, but then I'm still the one choosing how to proceed. I wouldn't want to give that task over entirely to AI. I feel like the management level tasks are things I should continue to do independently.

I also don't like to have AI take over any jobs/tasks that I don't thoroughly understand and can't already do myself. I have had AI generate lists of skills for me to acquire so I can better understand and tackle projects in different areas (not work related) and I can see myself doing the same if I needed to pick up a new work-related skill.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - it sounds like you've drawn some clear boundaries between the creative and strategic decisions you want to maintain control over versus the execution tasks you're comfortable delegating.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from how you use it now?

User: Provided it gets better at 'remembering' information and understanding time I would love to use it more for managing some of the planning and scheduling aspects of the job. Things like noticing that we haven't made a post about a particular topic in a while and it should probably be done soon, or my being able to give it dates of future events and then having it be aware of the current date and remind me about the event.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining control over the management-level decisions while delegating the tasks you find less enjoyable, and that clever solution you found when the AI started getting confused with dates.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've systematically integrated AI into your marketing workflow, the boundaries you've set around what to delegate versus keep control of, and especially that practical problem-solving example with the prompt refresh - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your process in such detail. Have a great rest of your day!
