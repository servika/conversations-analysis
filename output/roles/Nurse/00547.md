Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to refine my emails and generate educational content. The main task in my job is to create educational material like powerpoints and pdfs for hospice nurses so they can stay up to date with things like LCD guidelines and best practices. AI helps me to research and organize the information in a way that is concise and informative.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work, helping hospice nurses stay current with their practice. 

Tell me more about how AI helps you with the research and organizing part - what does that process typically look like for you?

User: I have a trained GPT that knows exactly how I like the powerpoints and pdfs to be formatted so I will usually give it a topic like "Heart Failure Hospice Care" and maybe some additional pdfs that are provided to me by the organization with information about guidelines or recent changes to procedures. I also sometime include screenshots of the forms the nurse's have to fill out so the model knows exactly what the nurses should be instructed on. The model then researches the topic and provides an outline for me to use.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you've really customized this process to work smoothly for your specific needs. 

When the model provides you with that outline, what happens next? Do you typically use it as-is, or do you find yourself making adjustments based on your own knowledge of what the nurses need?

User: I have to make adjustments based on what fits in a single slide or looks good on a PDF, its mainly formatting adjustments.  But sometimes the model gets minor things like dates mixed up. I then have to manually copy and paste the information into each slide and add images. With the pdfs, I'll normally copy and paste into word, add images, and export as a PDF.

AI: So you're essentially doing the final assembly and quality control while the AI handles the initial research and structuring. 

I'm curious about those minor errors you mentioned, like dates getting mixed up. How do you typically catch those - is it something you've developed a system for checking, or does it come from your existing knowledge of the subject matter?

User: I will usually look through all of the documents provided to me by the organization and fact-check everything so I know if there are any hallucinations. I always fact-check anything the model generates.

AI: That's a really thorough approach. It sounds like you've found a good balance where the AI handles the heavy lifting of research and organization, but you maintain oversight on accuracy.

Are there certain tasks in this process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer for AI to do most of the work. The most tedious part is copying and pasting everything into Powerpoint and sourcing the images online. I do this because currently AI isn't good at it. I have tried using programs that will make the presentations but they are normally full of hallucinations or irrelevant information and the generated images aren't anatomically correct which is a major issue in my line of work.

AI: That makes complete sense - anatomically correct images would be crucial for hospice nurse education. It sounds like you'd actually prefer to delegate even more to AI if the technology could handle those visual elements reliably.

When you're working through this process with your trained GPT - from giving it the topic and documents to getting the outline - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you collaborating back and forth throughout, or do you tend to give it the full task upfront and then work with what it produces?

User: I give it the full task upfront and then collaborate with it by telling it what tweaks need to be made.

AI: That collaboration piece is interesting. 

Can you walk me through what those tweaks typically look like? Are you usually asking for content changes, structural adjustments, or something else entirely?

User: Usually structural adjustments but sometimes I also need to tell it to make something more concise or more in depth depending on what I need.

AI: That gives me a good picture of your workflow. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at your organization use AI similarly, or are you kind of pioneering this approach?

User: I am the only one in the organization that creates the educational material so I am the only one using AI for this specific purpose but my boss is aware that I use AI and is very encouraging about it. I regularly get compliments on the work I put out.

AI: It sounds like you've found a really effective system that's working well for both you and your organization.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When OpenAI got rid of the legacy models like 4o I was really frustrated because the results GPT 5 gave me were terrible compared to what I was previously getting from 4o. I have since switch to Claude AI and found that the models perform creative writing and research tasks much better.

AI: That transition from 4o to GPT-5 sounds like it was a real disruption to your established workflow. 

What specifically about Claude's performance with creative writing and research made it work better for your educational material creation? What differences did you notice?

User: The writing flows more smoothly and sounds a lot more natural. It isn't obvious that it is AI writing it, whereas GPT5 sounds very robotic and doesn't follow instructions well. Claude is also better at following instructions so the research ends up being better.

AI: That instruction-following capability sounds crucial for your work, especially with that trained format you mentioned earlier.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No, its not because I know AI is constantly evolving and I evolve with it. If AI can do something better than me, that's great. There are plenty of skills AI isn't great with that I can learn.

AI: That's a really adaptive mindset. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What would you hope to see change or improve?

User: I envision AI being more attuned to my needs and the educational content I like to produce. It will eventually be trained on everything I do and the knowledge base would be updated periodically when there are changes in procedures. It will also be better at writing like I do- basically an extension of me.

AI: That vision of AI as an extension of yourself is really compelling - almost like having a collaborator that knows your work style intimately.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your workflow and how you've adapted to different AI tools. I particularly appreciated your perspective on evolving alongside AI rather than worrying about skill replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've built this specialized workflow for hospice nurse education, and especially how you've navigated the transition between different AI models, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
