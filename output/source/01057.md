Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions - let's go ahead and get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a software engineer, currently working as an independent Android app developer. I'd say my main usage categories are (1) research, (2) learning, and (3) as a quasi-peer programmer / code reviewer. For example, for research I might ask a chatbot to offer alternative APIs or approaches to solving small coding problems. For learning, I heavily use AI when learning new technologies (I'm currently learning Python) - suggesting resources, giving code samples, etc. As a peer programmer, AI can be useful to double check small pieces of code - it's not as great as a second set of human eyes, but it's helpful as a solo developer.

AI: That's a really comprehensive way you've broken down your usage. I'm particularly interested in that "quasi-peer programmer" role you mentioned.

When you're using AI as that code reviewer or peer programmer, what does that interaction typically look like? Are you working back and forth with it on a piece of code, or do you more often present it with finished code to review?

User: I do both. If we're working with real production code, it's more likely it's something I already wrote, double checked, and integrated into the codebase myself. If I want a quick double check to make sure there are no typos or logic errors, AI can be great for that. That's probably the most common use case. If I'm collaborating, I'm usually passing code back and forth in large chunks. It might look something like this: "Implement this method for me" -> I would take this, use it as inspiration, create my own implementation, and build and test myself. If i have questions or want another inspiration for an alternative approach, I might paste a couple functions back into the chat and ask for ideas or review. At the moment, I don't find AI very useful to direct work on my codebase. But for inspiration, it's great.

AI: That distinction between using AI for inspiration versus direct work on your codebase is really interesting. 

When you say AI isn't very useful for direct work on your codebase, what specifically makes that challenging? Is it about context, or accuracy, or something else entirely?

User: I think in terms of maintainability and correctness, in a complex codebase, all AI code needs to be double checked. It's definitely not plug and play for me right now. In terms of accuracy, one thing that sticks out is that the bot typically won't have access to source code or documentation for dependencies. In an Android app with hundreds of dependencies, that can be a problem. Information can be out of date. I suppose that's a context issue too. If the code is completely correct, it's generally going to need to be cleaned up to fit the style of the codebase, be made maintainable, tested, and double checked for performance and fit with the rest of the code. I haven't found a tool that can accomplish all of that yet, but again personally, I think it's important to review and test everything myself anyways.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - especially the point about dependencies and the maintenance aspects. It sounds like you have a pretty deliberate approach to what you keep under your own control.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: In general I think I'm using AI where I can. One exception that does come to mind that I've tried before is autocomplete and refactoring tools in the IDE. I ended up turning them off. I think that came out of (1) a desire to reinforce my own skill set. Literally typing the code myself helps me learn. and (2) out of a desire to keep the codebase in a consistent style, and make decisions out of personal preference (probably a secondary concern, as the autocomplete can usually pick up on that. I will say I am open to trying the IDE integration again in the future.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - the connection between physically typing code and learning is something I hadn't considered before.

You mentioned reinforcing your own skill set. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your day-to-day work?

User: AI hasn't really changed my thoughts in that regard. As a software engineer, it's already critical that I stay up to date and keep learning every day.

AI: That's a good point - staying current has always been part of the job.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you're working independently now, has that changed how you approach using these tools compared to when you might have worked in a team setting?

User: My most recent work in a team was a few years ago, before AI was widely available. So I don't have any direct experience with that. If I were to hire someone and create my own culture, I would probably emphasize using AI to boost productivity, but be very strict about professionalism quality and double checking everything.

AI: That balance between productivity and quality control makes sense. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There have been plenty of times when hallucinations, long conversations with long context, or the AI just following what I'm saying (even when I'm incorrect) - have been frustrating. I think I've gotten better at identifying when it's time to dig in to something on my own, if AI isn't going to solve the problem for me. There are probably an equal amount of times where I've been incredibly satisfied because a chatbot suggested an API that I didn't know existed, and would have taken me hours of research to find.

AI: That contrast is really striking - the frustration of hitting those limitations versus the satisfaction of discovering something that saves you hours of work.

You mentioned getting better at identifying when it's time to dig in on your own. What signals tell you that AI isn't going to solve the problem and you need to switch approaches?

User: If I notice hallucinated APIs, it's a clue that the chatbot doesn't have up to date information on a library. If I notice the bot forget what we were talking about before, It's a clue that there's too much context in the chat. Sometime's I'll literally open a fresh chat and put the relevant info up front. Other times, that can just be a clue that the problem is too complex.

AI: Those are really practical signals to watch for. The fresh chat strategy is clever - essentially resetting the context when things get too tangled.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the tools improve, or as your own experience with them grows?

User: I'd like to keep using AI as a primary source for research and inspiration. It's quite good already for these purposes and I only see them improving. I'd like to use AI to automate things where I can, like integrating a support chatbot into my Android app, or analyzing usage metrics, in the future.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as inspiration rather than for direct codebase work, and how you've developed those practical signals for when to switch approaches.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that covers everything, thanks for letting me share my thoughts.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI for productivity while maintaining code quality and personal skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
