Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use it very often, mainly for research about local community services that can support people with various challenges.

AI: Tell me more about that research work. What does that process look like when you're using AI to find information about community services?

User: I will mainly search for specific services on a topic like housing or social groups and activities in the area that I work in. It saves on research time which is a key part of my job role as my time tries to work holistically where possible.

AI: That sounds really helpful for your holistic approach. When you're doing this kind of research for community services, how do you typically work with the AI? Do you give it a specific request and let it handle the search completely, or do you find yourself going back and forth with it to refine what you're looking for?

User: I tend to go back and forth, I am aware that AI hallucinates so I will double check recommendations to ensure they are accurate.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anything involving patients care, I wouldn't feel confident delegating that to AI yet.

AI: What is it about patient care tasks that makes you feel they're different from the research work you're comfortable using AI for?

User: They are legal documents as they are on the patients medical record. I definitely do not want to be caught out if something goes wrong and my notes are used in coroners court so it all needs to be completely accurate.

AI: That makes complete sense given those stakes. When you think about how your colleagues or your workplace culture approaches AI use, how has that influenced the way you use these tools in your work?

User: Most likely, my colleagues have not yet adopted AI tools.

AI: Tell me more about that. What do you think accounts for the difference between your willingness to try AI for research tasks versus your colleagues not adopting it yet?

User: I am younger and more technologically savvy. My colleagues are more used to working without technology and are therefore more comfortable without it.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have always been generally satisfied with my use of AI, I dont use it often enough for any particular incidents to stand out.

AI: When you do use it for that community services research, what specifically about the experience tends to satisfy you? Is it the time savings you mentioned, or something else about how it works?

User: Mainly the time savings, and it sometimes finding a more obscure service I might have missed otherwise.

AI: That discovery aspect sounds valuable. How do you think about maintaining your research skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I am looking to go into further academic training so keeping my research skills sharp is of importance.

AI: How do you balance using AI for efficiency while still keeping those research skills sharp for your academic goals?

User: I primarily use my research skills and supplement occasionally with AI tools to keep those skills sharp.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can imagine AI use will increase, other teams in my organisation are trialling tools which write up consultation notes based on a voice recording which would save significant time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance AI assistance with maintaining your own research skills for your academic goals.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing else thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI selectively - embracing it for research efficiency while maintaining clear boundaries around patient care documentation - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
