Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good - no questions from me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I run a small business/ hobby (technically a business, since I make money from it and treat it as a business) doing fantasy map commissions for independent authors and DnD players. I also create my own fantasy map assets (such as mountains, icons, trees, really anything you might find on a fantasy map) and sell them on [REDACTED], on Etsy, and a marketplace for map assets. A typical project can be one of two things: a commission involves receiving a request for a custom map from a client. They fill out the details regarding the map, and I correspond with them before, during, and after designing the map. I use digital programs such as Wonderdraft and Procreate to create this map, then I send it to the client and go through a revision process. Commissions usually take a week or so per map, about 3 hours per day. Then the map asset projects are a bit different, as I do this on my own schedule. I'll come up with a pack theme (such as pirates, medieval, isometric cities, etc) and make a list of assets and a rough count of each to include. I'll then draw the assets on Procreate, export them to my PC, organize and name the files, create product listing images and promos for them, then upload them to the appropriate markets.

AI: That sounds like a really fascinating niche! The combination of commissioned work and creating your own asset packs gives you such a unique perspective on the creative process.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I only use AI tools in my asset pack creation, not commissions. If I'm having a hard time coming up with assets to fit in the pack I want to make, I'll ask AI tools such as Gemini or ChatGPT to help me brainstorm some ideas. Then, when I'm designing the assets, I will ask a generative AI program to bulk create the assets I want to include. I use these asset sketches as guidelines for doing the linework of my drawings. I don't use the actual files, but instead, I'll trace over the sketches using my style of art, making modifications as I draw. The rest of the process, including shading, coloring, details, etc is done without AI.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found a specific role for AI in your workflow - using it as a brainstorming partner and then for creating reference sketches that you trace over in your own style.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I just recently started a pack of assets using an old inky style of art to fit antique fountain pen-drawn maps throughout history. I couldn't figure out the exact style I wanted, and couldn't replicate the images in my head onto Procreate, nor could I figure out the right shape for the mountains, so I used AI to generate about 30 jagged mountains using a blotchy ink shading so that I could see a tangible, visual representation of what was in my head so I could better replicate it with the Procreate brushes I have. It felt like cheating at first, to use AI to come up with a style that I don't have the skill to create on my own. But, I figured that I'm not stealing work, I'm not using the images themselves as the assets, and I'm only using the images as inspiration instead of the end product. So, it's okay, in my mind. I'm just using AI to fill the skill gaps I still have until I improve my craft enough to confidently fill those gaps on my own.

AI: Tell me more about that feeling of it being like "cheating" at first. What shifted for you that made you feel like it was okay?

User: A lot of artwork on Etsy (a marketplace I sell on) is AI-generated, and I've seen people online criticize the use of AI for artwork in general. So, I felt super guilty at first, because I want to make "real" art, using my own ideas, designs, creativity, my own hand drawing the artwork. Then, I realized that I'm still doing all of that. I'm not generating artwork in 2 seconds just to turn around and sell that same image on Etsy for $3 as if I'm the artist. I admit that there is creativity in formulating prompts to give generative AI so that the end result is the best it can possibly be. But I don't want my brand and my business image to be so heavily tied to AI and the stigma that surrounds it. I don't want to be accused of stealing artwork, or stealing ideas and styles and designs. When I realized that my use of AI isn't making use of these unethical practices, I felt less guilty. Because I'm still using my ideas, my designs, my creativity, and my hand drawing the artwork. I'm just using AI as a tool to brainstorm some ideas and show me what proper perspective, proportions, and shadows look like on an asset. These are all things that I'm learning from the AI generations. When I realized that I'm not stealing anything, and that I'm not using AI in an unethical way (in my opinion), I felt okay with it. I don't see it as any different than following a "how to draw mountains on your map" guide from another creator. At least this way, I'm still staying true to my own style.

AI: That's such a thoughtful way of thinking through the ethics of it. It sounds like you've really worked out your own boundaries around what feels authentic to your creative practice.

When you're working with AI in this way - using it to help you visualize what's in your head or learn about perspective and shadows - how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions in that collaboration?

User: Well, it's just me working in this business, and the generative AI I use is only capable of generating images. It isn't a chatbot or collaborative partner in any way. So, I guess I'm driving the creative decisions. I'm telling it where to place the shadows, what kind of perspective to use, whether to use flat 2D icons or isometric perspectives. The only "decisions" it makes is deciding how best to make those shadows or shapes or proportions realistic.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're very much in the driver's seat, using AI more like a specialized tool to execute your vision rather than as a creative partner.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'd say I'm more creative as a whole. I find it easier to come up with pack theme ideas, specific assets for those packs. I also find it easier to decide where to place shadows and shading on my own without using the generated images as guides. I've always known how to spot something that just looks "off", but recently, I've been able to figure out what exactly looks off and how to fix it. I think it's because I've spent so much time looking at these generated images and tracing the shapes and altering those shapes to be what I envisioned.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like working with AI has actually accelerated your learning as an artist. You mentioned being able to better identify what looks "off" and how to fix it now.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: AI generated assets look good, objectively. There is one creator who only puts out AI-generated assets, and doesn't alter them much from the generated output, so he can put out a new asset pack once or twice a week and charge $6 for each pack because of how good they look and how many assets are included. I'm worried that the AI-generated assets will oversaturate the market and take exposure away from creators who design things by hand. It's already getting difficult to parse through that one creator's content to find hand-drawn styles, or antique styles that many people like. So, I'm afraid that my process of hand-drawing the assets and using AI only for brainstorming and to fill in my own creative limitations will be too slow to keep up.

AI: That's a really concrete concern - the speed and volume advantage that purely AI-generated content has over your more deliberate, hand-crafted approach. It sounds like you're seeing that tension play out in real time in the marketplace.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Ideally, I'd like to use AI to fill my gaps in creative skill until I improve enough to go through the entire design process without help. Then, I'd like to stop using generative AI. It would be nice to switch instead to an AI tool to help me organize and name files after I've designed and finalized the asset images, because that takes a considerable amount of time. Automation would really speed up the process and allow me to spend more time creating, but I just don't know of any AI that does that yet. Not reliably, at least. Realistically, I'm worried I'll need to keep using generative AI and even start selling generated content just to keep up in the marketplace so I can make a living.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've worked through the ethical considerations and defined your own boundaries around what feels authentic to your practice, as well as your honest concerns about the marketplace pressures you're facing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a learning tool while maintaining your artistic integrity, and the real marketplace challenges you're navigating, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your candor about both the benefits and concerns - it gives us a much richer understanding of what creative professionals are actually experiencing day-to-day.
