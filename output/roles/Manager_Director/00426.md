Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a content manager so I use AI to perform some of the more menial tasks that I would normally assign to a junior content creator. Unfortunately our team does not have capacity to hire a support staff for me so I'm expected to do everything, from the high level tasks to the low level ones.

AI: That sounds like you're juggling quite a lot on your own. When you mention those menial tasks that you now use AI for - what specific types of work are we talking about?

User: Primarily to come up with article titles, SEO meta data (browser title and meta description), and article summary blurbs to be used in our email newsletters

AI: Those sound like tasks that require a good understanding of your content and audience. When you hand these off to AI, how does that process typically work for you? Do you give it specific guidelines or examples to follow?

User: I give it instructions to follow such as character limitations. I don't typically give it any examples.

AI: Tell me more about how you give those instructions. Do you find yourself refining or adjusting what you tell the AI based on the results you get back?

User: Typically I don't have to adjust what I tell the AI based on what I get back because my typical workflow is to ask it to prove me with a list of results and I choose the best ones from there. If the entire list seems off-base or unusual then I may have to redirect it a bit

AI: That's an interesting approach - getting multiple options to choose from rather than trying to perfect a single result. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I perform editing tasks myself because I am a fast and efficient editor with decades of expertise, and I doubt AI could do a better job than I could. We also don't use AI to create any articles that contain financial advice since that might get us into trouble with our legal/compliance department, and is also a reputational risk

AI: That makes a lot of sense - drawing those lines based on both your expertise and risk considerations. When you are using AI for those title and metadata tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to delegate the complete task for it to handle independently?

User: I would probably delegate the completed task for it to handle independently. Honestly, these are not very sophisticated requests so I'm mostly confident that the AI can handle them without me needing to micromanage it

AI: That confidence in delegating those specific tasks seems to work well for your workflow. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We are a small team, and my role (content) is honestly not given a huge priority on my team so my team has dwindled from having three content people to just me. So I need to rely on AI to fill in some of the gaps.

AI: It sounds like AI has become pretty essential for managing that increased workload. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. I really don't like coming up with titles for articles. I tend to spend too much time on it because I freeze up trying to think of a perfect title since the title is a very important element of the article. By asking the AI to generate article titles for me, it takes the pressure off myself. I was really pleasantly surprised with how well the AI was able to analyze the gist of the article and suggest relevant and catchy titles

AI: That's a great example of how AI can help with creative blocks. It sounds like it's not just about saving time, but also relieving that mental pressure you felt around perfectionism with titles.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not for myself because I've been in this business for 20 years and have 20 years of experience to draw upon. I do worry about junior roles being take over by AI. I learned by doing menial, easier tasks and built my skillset from there. If AI is now taking over that skillset, how will new people learn the craft?

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about how the learning path might change for people entering the field. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see myself using it more for brainstorming and maybe even creating new content as long as that content is fact-based or round-up/curation rather than insights or advice.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with that creative block around titles, and your concern about how junior roles might evolve when AI handles many of the foundational learning tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a support system when team capacity is limited, and your thoughtful approach to where you draw boundaries around AI use, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
