## Representative Examples

### Example 1: Interview 00610

**SDLC Score**: 25

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, projectManagement, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Yes, I do see my workflows evolving in the very near future, I have it on my personal development roadmap to start experimenting with some of the Agent offerings from various vendors, and seeing where and how they can help."

2. "Hmmmm, I don't think so -- but do reach out if you ever want to continue this conversation. I can't provide any details. But talk to your project manager about if it would be possible."

### Example 2: Interview 00514

**SDLC Score**: 13

**Categories**: requirements, design, development, testing, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Yes, I still do a fair amount myself. I don't have the AI just report "met" or "not met" but instead have it report back the actual sentence or clause # so that I can check, because there is a lot of nuance. I have to be aware that companies can address the requirements in a variety of ways. There a..."

2. "I am pretty quiet about my use of AI unless the client has already mentioned that they use it. Sometimes, I don't tell them at all. For example, on a simple audit, I don't tell them that I did a first pass on the SOPs, because I charge a fixed-price. The AI is saving me time, and allows me to essent..."

### Example 3: Interview 00527

**SDLC Score**: 10

**Categories**: development, testing, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I use AI in two key domains: Producing work product for clients and managing my business. I am a marketing consultant doing work that runs from strategy/branding to project implementation. So, I use AI assistants for the following client-facing work: Writing high level summaries of long form work I ..."

2. "I don't ask AI to outline articles of my own for me. I write a fair amount on various topics. I prefer to work on refining the main idea or thesis of a piece using AI, but I do not like having AI outline the work for me. I may solicit feedback on an outline, but I do not want to be guided on creatin..."

### Example 4: Interview 00708

**SDLC Score**: 9

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I am self-employed as a sales consultant and part-time content creator. I find I use AI less for the sales side of my job but use it frequently for content creation. I pull Chat GPT up at the beginning of every work day. Right now I'm using it most frequently to help me write an ebook, for organizin..."

2. "I prefer to write copy myself for the same reason I like writing my own emails. I know I could outsource that to AI, but typically I ask AI to edit them or fact check, rather than writing the copy from scratch. It's important to me that I maintain my voice in all my work"

### Example 5: Interview 00858

**SDLC Score**: 7

**Categories**: development, projectManagement, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I always provide the Make, model, trim level, and mileage of the vehicle I am posting. I also give some form of price to include, either an estimated monthly payment or a total price."

2. "I will typically trim out "salesy" filler material in the provided descriptions. The benefit of the AI is the ability to create quick list of options a specific vehicle might have, without having to research myself."
