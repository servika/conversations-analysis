Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I worked on some research on the electrodeposition of nickel onto 3D printed polymers. The idea was first conceptualized by me due to the need of rapid manufacturing paired with the increased durability. First I reviewed many current and relevant research articles on various websites and decided on a path forward. I decided to use a fundamental Watts electrolyte formulation. This is where I implemented AI; I used it to synthesize all the current literature on Watts electrolyte formulations to find the most viable method of electrodeposition onto polymers coated in silver conductive paint. I then verified these statements and proceeded to inquire AI about ideal process parameters based on the electrolyte formulations. I think proceeded to conduct experiments with these formulations and operating parameters and perform testing on the produced specimens.

AI: That's fascinating research - the combination of 3D printing with electrodeposition for rapid manufacturing sounds really innovative. 

You mentioned using AI to synthesize the literature on Watts electrolyte formulations and then asking about ideal process parameters. Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for those specific parts rather than your traditional approach to literature review and parameter selection.

User: Well AI can more quickly skim through many literature results than would be possible by a single researcher in the same time frame. Also AI typically has access to more databases than I would think to look through. AI can more easily find key words and provide relevant articles that I can then further dive into to speed up the research process.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the speed and breadth of searching capabilities you're describing sound really valuable for getting through that initial literature screening.

When AI provided you with those relevant articles and process parameters, how did you go about verifying or validating what it had given you before moving forward with your experiments?

User: I would make a list of the values provided and go through the sources provided by AI and verify that they were those exact parameters with the correct deposition setup.

AI: So you'd cross-reference the AI's recommendations against the original sources to make sure the parameters and setups matched exactly - that's a thorough verification process.

Thinking about the other parts of your research - like the experimental design, the actual electrodeposition work, or analyzing your test results - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: I have used AI to do a cursory analysis on some figures I constructed and some microscope pictures but these tend to be less reliable due to there complex nature. I usually use AI in this instance to help lead me in a direction of inquiry before discovering more targeted findings. AI is good at coming up with an experimental design and I have used it for that in the past but most of my research has budget/time/specimen limits so the "ideal" design isn't always viable.

AI: That's really insightful - you're using AI as more of a starting point or direction-finder for complex analysis rather than relying on it for final conclusions. And the gap between "ideal" experimental design and practical constraints is something I hadn't considered.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I would love for it to be able to draw unique conclusions based on large datasets. For example providing AI with a large dataset on the hardness values of a cross section of electro deposited nickel and having it determine that the additive content saccharin was depleted during the deposition due to the decreasing hardness further from the substrate.

AI: That's a really compelling example - having AI make those kinds of sophisticated causal inferences from experimental data patterns, like connecting the hardness gradient to saccharin depletion during deposition. That would be quite a leap from where you're using it now.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as both a research accelerator and a starting point for inquiry, while being very deliberate about verification, were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI to accelerate the front-end research process while maintaining rigorous verification practices really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you balance leveraging AI's speed and breadth with the practical constraints of actual lab work was especially illuminating.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
