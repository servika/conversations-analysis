Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, that sounds great!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a caregiver for an elderly woman. I help her with tasks such as managing her prescriptions, meal prepping, and grocery shopping. I use AI to ask for help with medical related questions, brainstorm ideas, or do tasks like make shopping lists.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work. When you mention using AI for medical-related questions, can you tell me more about what that looks like? What kinds of situations prompt you to reach out to AI for help?

User: For example, she'll want to add a new supplement or food into her diet and I'll ask AI if it is likely to be a concern for any of her medications/conditions. Or I'll ask it for recipe related ideas that help her target certain nutrients.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to support her care. When you're working through these kinds of questions - like checking about supplement interactions or finding nutrient-focused recipes - how do you typically approach the conversation with AI? Do you find yourself going back and forth with follow-up questions, or do you usually get what you need from that first exchange?

User: I typically ask a few follow-up questions just to be sure there aren't conflicting answers. Or I'll be collaborative with it.

AI: When you say you'll be collaborative with it, what does that look like in practice? Can you walk me through an example of how that collaboration unfolds?

User: So, say she's told to add more potassium to her diet. I would ask AI to help me come up with recipe ideas with foods high in potassium but are still blood-sugar balancing. And say some of its suggestions include foods I know she will not like. Then, I would give AI examples of things she does like/can have and help guide it to giving more helpful suggestions.

AI: That's a really clear example of how you work together to get to something useful. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your caregiving work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't currently use it to say manage her appointments/schedule which I could potentially use AI for. That is more due to it not being overly difficult though.

AI: That makes sense - if something's manageable on your own, why add another layer. Are there other aspects of your caregiving work where you actively choose to handle things yourself, perhaps for reasons beyond just difficulty level?

User: I do not use AI to entertain her as I prefer the more human/nurturing approach to my work.

AI: That's really insightful - the human connection being something you want to preserve. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since caregiving can sometimes be more independent work, how do others in your field or the family you work with view your use of AI?

User: I work independently and I have not personally heard many people talk about it. I assume it is similar to me and is for simple questions or research. The family I work for is not very tech savvy so there AI use is limited. There has never been any negative sentiment shared about it though.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I asked AI to help me explain in simple terms how to do a basic massage on a tendon in her foot that was irritated. It was easy to follow and ended up being super helpful.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience - being able to get clear, actionable guidance that you could then use to help her directly. On the flip side, have you had any moments where working with AI left you feeling frustrated or like it wasn't quite hitting the mark?

User: There have been some times where its recommendations for meal ideas are kind of repetitive, but I have not had any major issues or frustrations.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do not fear that in my industry as the human connection and hands-on element are essential when dealing with the elderly.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - recognizing what's uniquely human about your work. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as you continue in this role?

User: I do not personally see me adding more AI use or changing anything unless AI itself evolves more. For example, hypothetically AI could be used for scheduling appointments and communicating with providers, but it really is not there yet in my industry.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on preserving the human connection in caregiving - that distinction between where AI can be a helpful tool versus where the human element remains irreplaceable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a supportive research tool while maintaining the essential human elements of caregiving will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
