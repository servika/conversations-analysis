Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a digital designer and use ChatGPT to assist with coding. I'm not a professional coder, and have limited experience. The chatbot helps identify what I need to be doing, sometimes it can be hard knowing where to begin; and it helps me integrate the changes I want in a web design, for example inserting snippets from a code library. Sometimes I can use it heavily, especially when I'm stuck, other days it's light because I've already learnt what I need from it and am just repeating the task.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like AI serves as both a guide and a problem-solver for you in coding. 

You mentioned that some days you use it heavily when you're stuck, and other days it's lighter because you've already learned what you need. Can you walk me through what a "heavy use" day typically looks like compared to one of those lighter days?

User: The heavy use days are more frustrating. There's usually a bug I can't figure out. It's also hard not knowing what to ask. So solving the issue usually follows a pattern of telling the chatbot what I'm experiencing on the user end (what the web site is doing), then it will suggest changes, I'll implement these changes - see if it works or not, if not I'll ask the question a different way till I can get something that works or at least changes something so I know where I have to focus. This is very different from a lighter day when I don't use the chatbot at all.

AI: That debugging process you described sounds pretty iterative - going back and forth until something clicks. You mentioned it's frustrating on those heavy use days.

Tell me more about that frustration. What specifically makes those interactions feel frustrating to you?

User: Not knowing where to look for a solution is the frustrating part. Sometimes it just feels like going over and over the same thing. But usually the solution is much more simple than I realise, or if I feel like I'm taking too much time, it can sometimes be navigated by substitution.

AI: That makes sense - the uncertainty of not knowing where to focus your efforts. You mentioned that solutions often turn out to be simpler than you realize, and that substitution can be a way forward when you're spending too much time.

Can you give me an example of what you mean by "substitution" in that context? How does that typically work for you?

User: Substitution can mean replacing the goal with something more accessible. For example, if I was trying to make a slideshow in a website act a certain way, instead of doing everything by scratch and having a chatbot assist me, I can just get the chatbot to assist me with finding and inserting a snippet from a code library. I suppose it achieves the same goal, but the path has been streamlined.

AI: That's a smart approach - shifting from building something custom to finding an existing solution that meets your needs. It sounds like you're making strategic decisions about when to persist with the original approach versus when to pivot.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yeah, there are things I prefer doing myself. I enjoy some of the simpler tasks, like CSS tasks. I really like the design/visual aspects of my work, so  I prefer working on the CSS myself or using a chatbot only when I'm stuck. I'm also a little mindful of not being too dependent, and knowing at least the terminology of the things I receive assistance on so in the future I can quickly write useful prompts.

AI: That's interesting - you're balancing enjoyment and skill development with efficiency. The CSS work sounds like something you find satisfying to do hands-on.

When you mention being mindful of not being too dependent, can you tell me more about how you think about that balance? What does "too dependent" look like to you?

User: "Too dependent" means using a chatbot in a brainless way, in a way where I have no idea what I'm really doing even at a high level. This can lead to a lack of satisfaction with the work, and not feeling in control. There have been times where I've been lazy, and have not wanted to have at least a little understanding of what I'm doing. This leads nowhere. It's just like hitting a wall again and again. If you don't know what you're doing, things just get worse, the problem gets bigger as you progress - so there's really no shortcuts.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - the difference between using AI as a tool while maintaining understanding versus just blindly following suggestions. You paint a clear picture of how that "brainless" approach can actually make problems compound.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate. I have a sense of what I need, and go to the chatbot for assistance in pieces as I make my way through a task. Sometimes I'll tell it a problem and it will give me many solutions all at once, I don't find this helpful. So I like to go in multiple steps like the chatbot is a colleague or supervisor.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds much more effective for you than getting a big dump of solutions all at once. The idea of treating it like a colleague or supervisor is really interesting.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yeah, I remember when I was trying to make something responsive. I'd been attempting this for a while. And up to this point, the chatbot had given me other solutions to try, but then suggested something about aspect ratio. I'd never use this before, so I asked questions. and when I included it, it did exactly what I wanted it to do - it make the image responsive to different screen sizes.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying breakthrough moment - when the chatbot introduced you to aspect ratio and it just clicked into place. It sounds like that experience combined learning something new with actually solving the problem you'd been wrestling with.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I'm self-employed.

AI: Ah, got it - so you're navigating this relationship with AI on your own terms without workplace influences.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do, I think it's already happening especially to my level of work. I don't really think of maintaining skills, I think I'll have to go into a different area of employment entirely. I don't feel the desire to compete in the ways necessary to outpace AI.

AI: That's a pretty significant perspective - thinking you might need to move into a different area entirely rather than trying to stay ahead of AI capabilities. 

Can you tell me more about what you mean by "compete in the ways necessary"? What would that look like, and why doesn't it appeal to you?

User: I think the skills I'd need to develop would be more technical - and I'm not interested. On the visual side of things, a lot of digital design can already be AI-generated and I'm not really sure what if any skills there would be to develop. Maybe there would be people that would be like directors, using AI as tools and not really doing the work themselves. But I don't think that'll be me.

AI: That's a really candid assessment - recognizing that the technical direction doesn't interest you, and that even the visual side is increasingly automated. The director role you mentioned is an interesting distinction - orchestrating AI rather than doing the hands-on work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving, especially given what you've shared about potentially moving to a different field?

User: I don't really know - maybe just more everywhere? I suppose I'll come to rely on it more heavily as it becomes better at understanding prompts from someone struggling to understand a problem.

AI: That's an honest answer - the uncertainty but also the recognition that it's likely to become more pervasive and better at helping even when you're not sure how to articulate the problem.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the balance between collaboration and dependency, and your candid view of how AI might reshape your field entirely.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining understanding while collaborating with AI, and your thoughtful perspective on how the field might evolve, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty throughout this conversation.
