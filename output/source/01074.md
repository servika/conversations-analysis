Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great - I don't have any questions right now.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I'm a PR and Communications Manager and over the past year, I would say that I've started to use AI almost hourly in my typical workday. I use it for quite a few different types of task, but predominantly it would be things like: improving clarity and tone, and sense-checking written communications I've crafted (whether internally to colleagues or part of external campaigns), brainstorming and ideating ideas for different projects, collaborating on the creation of content and sales enablement materials, coming up with structures for longer-form pieces of work I need to create or briefs for my copywriter, researching news stories and scanning the news for crisis situations we need to respond to, analysing marketing and PR data (particularly website analytics), doing basic maths equations and percentages, writing up meeting notes from scribbled handwritten screenshots, reading through meeting transcriptions and summarising or filling in gaps. There's many other usages but those are some that spring to mind!

AI: That's really comprehensive - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your workflow across many different aspects of your role. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. From all those tasks you mentioned, are there certain ones you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The more interested I am in a task, the more I want to take charge of it and do the majority myself. I find some creative tasks don't land quite so well with AI and are harder to prompt, so I often take these on myself. The easier the prompt, the more often I use AI. I would also say that I mostly frequently would use AI for more "boring" tasks, admin tasks or those that take up more time and headspace, like transcription. I also use it for things that I have limited understanding of and therefore enjoy less, like deciphering website analytics or troubleshooting software issues/learning how to use new programs or software via a step-by-step guide.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction you're making between tasks you find engaging versus those that feel more routine or outside your expertise. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It really varies depending on the complexity of what I need and how "fleshed out" the task is in my mind. For straightforward proof-reading and sense-checking, or if I have basic mathematical equations to work out, I generally let AI handle it and delegate. If it's something I haven't fully grasped yet, I collaborate and brainstorm with AI to tease out the problem - for example, if I have half an idea of how to use a new program like Jotform to create a survey, but I haven't quite figured out how to take my ideas to an actual concrete plan and need help understanding how the program can support me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like the level of clarity you have about the task really shapes how you engage with AI. You collaborate when you need to work through something, but delegate when the path forward is clear.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: In the past year, we have had a lot of changes at work including the arrival of a new Commercial Director with aggressive targets, who is now my direct line manager. Also, there is a very aggressive competitive environment (the wider industry would be classed as HR tech) and AI is being increasingly used as a USP in this industry and a method of delivering our actual services. As a result, there is greater pressure on output and results, and so AI is seen widely in the company as both a necessity and a helpful support to help us increase what we can achieve. However, there is also a lot of suspicion and concern about AI amongst colleagues, and a very mixed understanding and propensity to it.

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - it sounds like there's this tension where AI is both seen as essential for meeting higher demands, but there's also wariness around it. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It's always easier to think of an example of frustration for some reason - I must tend towards the negative!! A few months ago we were asked by an external marketing consultant to quickly produce a lead magnet whitepaper about global hiring. She suggested using AI to write it. However, when I tried to do this, I found the output quite frustrating, because it is a longer format than ChatGPT (the LLM I was using) would usually support. I had to find multiple workarounds, firstly by asking it to produce an example structure (having given quite a detailed brief in a prompt) and then, I had to work through each chapter of the proposed structure step-by-step and ask the model to flesh it out into a full chapter. It did work, but I found that I had to give a lot more oversight, guidance and suggestion than I expected, and sections had to be redrafted. I also noticed a tendency towards using a very repetitive structure, where each chapter would start in a similar way, talk about the pain points, use a case study example of a solution, and then draw to a close. The lack of variety became obvious and it was a hard job to make it sound more fluid and varied.

AI: That sounds like a really revealing experience - it highlights how AI can struggle with longer, more complex formats and how the repetitive patterns become quite noticeable. It sounds like you ended up doing much more work than you anticipated.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about this all the time - I believe the majority of my job will probably be overtaken by AI one day. I think my role will eventually become focused around prompting, overseeing, training and quality-controlling the models rather than actually doing the work myself. I am actively trying to learn more about these areas and improve my skills in prompting so I can keep ahead of the curve.

AI: That's a really thoughtful and proactive approach - it sounds like you're already thinking ahead about how your role might evolve rather than just focusing on current tasks.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will either stay the same (as I use it considerably already) or will increase in usage in the future. I hope that I'll continue to improve the success of my prompts and find innovative ways to incorporate AI for good outputs. There is however also a scenario where our use of AI becomes more internally regulated due to the potential compliance risks and liabilities around using AI output for marketing and PR of a company, and also the risks associated with the input of certain information into unregulated/third-party models. I don't know if they will restrict or monitor what we can use it for, eventually.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - you can see both the potential for growth and the very real regulatory challenges that might shape how you can use it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you articulated the distinction between collaborating versus delegating based on task complexity, and your forward-thinking perspective on how your role might evolve.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so. I enjoyed the conversation - thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining creative control, and your thoughtful approach to skill development in this changing landscape, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
