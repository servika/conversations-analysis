Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm beginning to utilize it more and more as new functions arise and I begin to trust the responses more.  I'm currently using it to write letters of recommendation for colleges, scholarships, internships, and employment on behalf of students I don't even know but require a recommendation of some sort.  I've created a series of questions I provide to the students about their backgrounds, interests, etc. and input that information into AI so that it creates a somewhat personalized letter based on student information. I also use it to input student preferences like location, climate, business interest, and family budget so that it spits out a list of colleges or programs I can review with students and families to discern the best college "fit."

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI to help students with some really important life decisions. It sounds like you've developed a systematic approach with those questionnaires.

Tell me more about that trust-building process you mentioned. What made you start trusting the responses more over time?

User: The responses are becoming more personal and don't just regurgitate the same wording and format time after time.  I no longer have to ask for "no bullet points or em dashes," which are automatic tell-tale signs of an AI product, it seems, and when I request variations in tone, such as casual, informal, or witty, the products appear to match that more now than in the past year.

AI: That's really interesting - you've clearly been observing how the outputs have evolved. It sounds like you've become quite skilled at recognizing AI patterns and knowing how to prompt for more natural results.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, I still review all AI products like rec letters and suggested college lists to infuse my personality or add a personal touch that the model cannot pick up on from ingested information.  Specifically, if a student included on their bragsheet any kind of very personal or traumatic life circumstance, I will usually alter the product myself to either include or exclude those details or the way they're shared without sounding too mechanical.  I also like to vary sentence structures to appear more human, and AI still seems to follow similar syntax throughout all answers.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're adding that human nuance that's so important, especially when dealing with sensitive personal details. It's clear you have a keen eye for recognizing when something needs that personal touch.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: A combination of both, typically.  I initially delegate the complete task, such as "write a formal recommendation later for [REDACTED]'s acceptance to UCLA and include all information provided" as I paste the information [REDACTED] (the student) has shared with me. But I still have not used a product from the first submission; instead, I'll collaborate to add personal details, break up topics more, add a short sentence that conveys my professional opinion, etc.

AI: That's a really clear workflow - you're essentially using AI as a strong first draft generator, then moving into that collaborative phase to refine it. It sounds like you never consider that first output to be the final product.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues use AI for all their writing components, much to the chagrin of some of our families who have complained about the lack of personality associated with the template-like responses.  It is for this reason that I still add my own contributions as a final product, though in all honesty, my colleagues' workloads have halved while mine is much longer, albeit still quicker than writing each letter by hand off the cuff as I have done for so many years.

AI: That's really insightful - you're navigating this balance between efficiency and quality, while some colleagues have fully embraced the time savings. It sounds like you're getting feedback from families that reinforces your decision to keep adding those personal touches.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI satisfies me on a daily basis since it is able to create a thorough recommendation in seconds, even though I still spend some time manipulating or adding to it.  But that process used to take an hour or so at least, and with a caseload of nearly 2000 students and families, there were not enough hours in the day during the "busy season" of college applications in the fall.   Now, I'm able to personally meet with families to review information when before, no time was left to do so.

AI: That's a powerful transformation - going from being overwhelmed during busy season to actually having time for personal meetings with families. It sounds like AI has fundamentally changed your capacity to serve students.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really, since my line of work still involves a significant level of understanding and empathy.  When I'm not spending time on all the paperwork but can instead speak to a family personally in my office, I can gauge their passion, nerves, work ethic, and goals that are rarely evident on paper.   Maya Angelou's quote about people remembering how you make them *feel* is significant here, since the AI models cannot replace true listening and understanding.

AI: That's beautifully put - you're focusing on the uniquely human aspects of your work that AI can't replicate. The Maya Angelou reference really captures something essential about your role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope it can evolve into more personal writing automatically and without that type of response only taking place after I request it to be so in the prompt. Essentially, I hope it can handle most of the rote paperwork like rec letters, transcript analysis, and up-to-date admissions statistics so that I can use that information in personal one-on-one family sessions instead of spending time creating it myself.

AI: That vision makes perfect sense - AI handling more of the administrative foundation so you can focus entirely on those meaningful human interactions with families.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has shifted your role from being buried in paperwork to having time for the personal connections that truly matter in college counseling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
