Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. Lets begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I use AI most days. I am a self employed sole trader Heritage Consultant, and spend most of my time writing professional reports or assessments. I use AI like a well informed colleague, so I ask it what it thinks about arguments I might be planning to user, or for ideas about things like design principles. Sometimes I ask it to describe buildings for me. The main one is that I use it like an editor, to review draft reports and help me address spelling and grammar and refine my language.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a well-informed colleague is a vivid way to describe it. 

You mentioned asking AI for ideas about design principles and having it describe buildings. Can you tell me more about that? What does a typical interaction look like when you're seeking those kinds of ideas or descriptions?

User: For example, in a recent report the proposal was to demolish a building leaving an empty site in a a conservation area, which isnt great in policy terms. So I wrote a list of principles for future design to help demonstrate that whatever future building was developed at the site woudl be approproate and take a account of its surroundings. So height, scale, mass, materials etc. I wrint a draft list and then asked AI if it had any more suggestions. and it did!

AI: That's a great example! So you had already developed your own draft list of design principles, and then used AI to expand on it.

When AI suggested additional principles that you hadn't thought of, how did you handle those suggestions? Did you accept them as-is, or did you modify them based on your professional expertise?

User: I modified them based on the correct sort of language I wanted to use, and to ensure they were in the right 'heritage' tone. And some weren't relevant so I took those out

AI: That makes sense - filtering and adapting the suggestions to match your professional voice and expertise.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The main thing I enjoy in my job is the research, understanding and learning about a site and its history. Getting into seeing if there are books, old photos etc. I think AI could probably do some of that but I like doing it.

AI: That's fascinating - the research and discovery aspect is what you find most engaging about your work.

When you say AI could probably help with that research but you prefer doing it yourself, what is it about that process that you particularly enjoy? What would be lost if AI handled that part?

User: I enjoy research for its own sake  - I am interested in history and places, and so often when researching things I'm finding might not be relevant, and I may well not use them in the end, but I enjoy the process and learning along the way. The learning is part of it which I'd lose if AI just did it for me. Also there's the fun of the 'aha!' moment when I find something helpful.

AI: That "aha!" moment and the joy of learning along the way - that really captures something important about the research process.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will collaborate more often than not. So I will draft a report / chapter and then once its completed and all the info in that I think I need to include, I will put it into AI and ask it for its opinion - comments on writing style, professionalism of language, and spelling and grammar etc. I will often also ask for thoughts on if I can improve my argument anywhere, and how someone arguing back might frame their comments, which is helpful to know in advance.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds quite strategic - especially asking AI to anticipate counterarguments. That's really thoughtful.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? As a sole trader, I imagine you have a lot of autonomy, but are there any professional standards or client expectations that shape how you approach using AI?

User: Yes I'm completely autonomous. I work largely as a sub-contractor for other larger consultancies and the main one also uses AI in a similar way to me. There are no standards or expectations around its use that I know of. Though I suspect the end client would prefer that we didnt use it. (or didnt advertise that we do).

AI: That's an interesting tension you've identified - where you and your main contractor both use AI similarly, but you suspect the end client might prefer you didn't.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Not really frustrated, its usually pretty helpful. I sometimes find it fails to anticipate what I want, so I'll copy in a section of text and it will give comments rather than a re-written sections, but that's mainly on me being unclear. I have noticed its not great at architectural descriptions of buildings.

AI: That's helpful feedback - the architectural descriptions being a weak spot is interesting given that's part of your work.

When you say it's not great at architectural descriptions, what specifically does it struggle with? Is it the technical terminology, the visual details, or something else about how buildings should be described in your field?

User: The technical terminology is sometimes not quite right. And the use of language is also often inconsistent with how I'd describe things. It strays away from the sort of professional language that heritage people use into more general descriptions. It also doesn't always recognise newer/older sections of buildings, that sort of thing. Its really variable though. Sometimes its good

AI: That variability must make it tricky to rely on for those descriptions. It sounds like the nuanced professional language of heritage work is quite specific.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I joke with friends all the time that our job is only going to be around for so long before AI takes over. For now I think there's enough value put on my professional qualifications and affiliations, and enough doubt about AI's consistency/accuracy that we are safe. Also there's a degree of subjectivity always in decisions about the built environment and history that I think a human mind might still be better at dealing with (but I might well be wrong about that)

AI: That balance between professional credibility and AI capabilities is really interesting - and your point about subjectivity in heritage decisions seems particularly relevant.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in the next few years?

User: I don't know. I think it perhaps depends a bit more on how well AI develops. My job is fairly consistent and doesn't change a lot. But for example I often go out to site visits or to visit libraries and archives. If AI was able to deal with the library/archive visits that would be interesting, but much of that is still hard copy old plans etc. Honestly, I don't know how much it will change in the next few years, I think I'm something of an early adopter. Also, I think often about the unknown unknowns and the known unknowns. I think AI could probably do things for me already that I don't even consider asking it. I think as AI develops and I learn more I might use it for more and more things.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the joy of research and discovery, and how you've found that balance between leveraging AI as a collaborative tool while protecting the parts of your work that you find most fulfilling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative colleague while maintaining the human elements that make your work meaningful - especially that research and discovery process - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective as someone who's thoughtfully integrated AI into such a specialized field. Take care!
