Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good! I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure! I usually use AI when I'm working with code-heavy projects, or if I'm doing an analysis of some sort. Typically, during a busy period -- say I'm assigned to 2-3 projects for the week, I might see myself using AI to help generate code while I'm working on these projects to help me save time. I'm a data analyst, so I find myself writing a lot of repetitive code at times, and this helps save that. I would say that I'm a mediocre Python programmer as well, as I primarily work in R -- so I might use it to generate code for a coding language that I'm not very well-versed in -- to help save time.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like AI serves as both a time-saver for repetitive work and a bridge for languages you're less familiar with.

When you're working on those code-heavy projects, can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like? Are you usually asking AI to write entire functions, or are you more likely to work back and forth with it as you build something?

User: I would say a mixture of both! I explain the context and situation that I'm working with, and describe what needs to be done. Things like "I have a dataframe with these columns, and I want to make sure that for each unique ID of the column, the number of times they have this column as "1" should be counted up" -- and explain to it the pseudocode that I want to actualize into code. I generally know the data processing steps or situation that I want to do, but explain it in a very methodical way to ensure that mistakes or misunderstandings don't happen. If it's a statistical analysis, I might give the model information about my situation and problem, and ask it for suggestions on what types of analysis would be plausible -- and then go from there.

AI: That's a really clear picture of your approach - it sounds like you're maintaining control over the analytical thinking while leveraging AI for the implementation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Mmm, I think there are some tasks that I genuinely enjoy doing. For part of my work, I typically have to review applications for a program during specific periods of the year. I genuinely like this as it's not something that I usually do during my usual day-to-day operations. This task allows me to not just focus on data or not just do analyses like a code-monkey, but gives me the opportunity to enjoy things that I don't do on a typical basis, if that makes sense?

AI: That absolutely makes sense - it sounds like variety and stepping outside your usual analytical work is something you value. The human judgment and decision-making aspect of reviewing applications seems quite different from the more technical tasks.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern in more detail? From what you've shared, it sounds like you're collaborating with it throughout a task rather than just handing something off completely. Is that accurate, or does it vary depending on the situation?

User: Yes absolutely! I would never hand it off completely and I find that my job is much too detail-oriented and I personally would not be comfortable without testing it out or at least QAing the results of the output form the AI model.

AI: That's really insightful - the quality assurance aspect seems critical in your role. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that there are spoken or unspoken expectations about how AI should or shouldn't be used?

User: There hasn't been much discussion regarding AI at work. Currently, it's in this sort of gray area, where people don't talk about it. It's not being discouraged, but also not being mentioned as something to use actively. I find that due to this, I've been much more cautious about my usage of AI as it's not something that I would want people to know that I use.

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - operating in that gray area where it's neither encouraged nor discouraged. It sounds like you're navigating this somewhat privately.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One situation where I was satisfied, is when my boss asked me to ideate and come up with ideas for analysis to help answer a specific question/goal we were interested in answering. Since I have trouble with ideation often, AI actually provided tons of surprisingly adept suggestions for statistical tests, analysis direction, and ideas for me. 

A moment of frustration is usually when I miss an error that the AI output within the code, and it leads to my boss questioning me about why I did something the way I did, for which -- since there's that gray area that I was talking about before -- caused me a lot of a paranoia in assuming that they thought I was using AI in my work.

AI: That's a really revealing contrast - AI helping you overcome a genuine challenge with ideation versus the anxiety when an error exposes your AI usage. That paranoia you mention sounds quite stressful.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I often struggle with this, because it's something that I wonder if it has any benefits -- given how efficient and quick AI is. I think that it's always good to maintain a basic level of understanding of things like coding languages and statistical tests (in my line of work) -- essentially, to understand the basic concepts of things at a broad level. But maybe not as much so for niche, specific topics -- since it's something an AI could help you with.

AI: That tension between efficiency and skill development is really interesting - it sounds like you're trying to strike a balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining enough foundational knowledge to stay effective.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think that gray area you mentioned will shift, or do you see your own usage patterns changing?

User: I think it will stay relatively the same, unless there is a change in how my company approaches the usage of AI. If the gray area does change, I think I will still rely on AI regardless, since it has become so fundamental to my efficiency nowadays, that without it -- I don't think I would be able to output what has become the "norm".

AI: That's such an honest reflection - the idea that AI has become integral to maintaining your current output levels really highlights how quickly these tools can become embedded in our workflows.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that gray area dynamic and how it creates this cautious, almost secretive relationship with a tool that's clearly become essential to your productivity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating that workplace gray area, the balance between collaboration and quality control, and how AI has become fundamental to your efficiency will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty about both the benefits and the challenges - it paints a very realistic picture of how AI is actually being integrated into work today.

Have a great rest of your day!
