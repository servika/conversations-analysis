Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes and No questions.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a Cybersecurity Manager and use AI to help craft employee emails to my team and correct wording in documents.  I also ask it questions about technical topics I am unfamiliar with and to help me draft meeting agendas and ideas on how to implement change in my team.

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses. When you say you use AI to help craft employee emails to your team, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I write a rough idea of what I want to say in outlook and then ask the AI to make it sound professional and other parameters I want added.

AI: Tell me more about those other parameters you mentioned. What specific things do you typically ask the AI to adjust beyond making it sound professional?

User: Names, dates, and who to contact.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If I am writing a feedback for an employee, sometimes I feel like I need to have it come directly from what is in my head vice have AI write it for me.  I feel like the personal touch gets missing and want to reduce the risk of something being misconstrued.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making. When you do choose to write that employee feedback yourself, what is it about having it come directly from your head that feels important to you in those moments?

User: It feels more authentic.  Sometimes I feel that AI sounds artificial and lacks feeling in the messages.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I typically use it on and off throughout the day and have it help me as I do my workload.

AI: Can you give me an example of what that back-and-forth collaboration looks like during a typical task? How do you and the AI work together as you move through your workload?

User: If I am reviewing a document an employee wrote.  I will copy and paste parts in and ask it to write it better or how to make sections sound better or more cohesive.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We have a very stressful environment with tremendous change and I want to always make sure everything from instructions to feedback is crystal clear and using AI has helped with that.  We are encouraged in my organization to implement AI into our work to help us write our emails and make things more efficient.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used AI to help me write the introduction email to my team in my new role I took on as their supervisor [REDACTED].  I gave it what I wanted to say and the AI wrote a professional yet practical message that really reflected the kind of person that I am.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience. What specifically about that AI-generated message made you feel like it captured who you are as a person? What did it get right?

User: I asked it word it in a realistic and down-to-earth manner, which is me.  It used plain language and was clear and to the point.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I definitely consider it on a frequent basis and think about keeping up with the latest AI techniques and processes.  Since I work in Cybersecurity, I have to continually educate myself on new technology so I stay relevant and on-top of the latest trends.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will eventually have AI write my performance reviews for my employees based on their self-evals and an input template I will provide it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting that authentic, personal touch when giving employee feedback, and how you're thinking strategically about staying current with AI trends in cybersecurity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with authenticity, and how AI helps you communicate more clearly in a high-stress environment, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
