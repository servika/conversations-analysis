Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, we can begin.

AI: Perfect, thank you.

Let's start with the big picture - could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a software developer, I currently use AI to help with research and to brainstorm potential ways to solve a given problem. I will also occasionally have it review a report or email I have written to clean the report up and improve the writing.

AI: That's helpful context. When you mention using AI for research and brainstorming solutions - can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically approach AI when you're trying to solve a problem?

User: As I deal with sensitive information, I will give it a cleaned up version of the problem I am facing that will remove most of the context and any potential data from the problem. I give it a rough rundown of my codebase's architecture and what I envision the solution being. Then I will ask it if my solution makes sense or if there are better ideas or a less complex method I am overlooking. I will also use it to quickly look up new tools or methods that may help me in my day-to-day. This gives me a jumping off point for deeper research on my own and is helpful as I didn't have to spend the initial time looking up background info

AI: That's really insightful - so you're using it as a starting point to accelerate your own research process. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you clean up problems to remove sensitive context. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself entirely, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I may ask it to prepare some boilerplate code, but I like to code all the other logic myself. I am wary of potential hallucinations or logic issues if I ask AI to code anything other than boilerplate. This also ensures I know all the logic of my codebase since I wrote it myself. It is a huge productivity boost to just use it for boilerplate

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that direct knowledge of your logic while still getting the productivity benefits from the routine parts.

When you do use AI for things like brainstorming solutions or reviewing your writing, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a task and let it handle that piece independently?

User: For an email or response to a coworker, I will often give it the context and a brief overview of what I want it to say then ask it to craft the correspondence. I will read over the correspondence and if there are any pieces I want edited, I will ask it to edit that specific piece and give me the full edited correspondence back. For things such as reports, I will make a rough draft and have the AI review it for any errors and ask it to suggest a cleaned-up and more professionally worded version

AI: That's a clear distinction in how you approach different types of writing tasks. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: My direct coworkers are very AI-forward and like to see any place it can fit into our workflows to improve efficiency. I have one coworker who uses it to sum up meeting transcriptions and give bulleted action lists per person involved in the meeting. We are also seeing where else it can improve efficiencies in our work. My workplace is a little more reserved in AI adoption, but it is currently researching ways to incorporate Agentic Agents in various places throughout the business to improve efficiency

AI: Interesting - so there's this contrast between your immediate team being very proactive about AI integration while the broader workplace is taking a more cautious, research-focused approach.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have experienced both satisfactory and frustrating experiences. For a frustrating experience, I was working on a feature for the app I maintain. I asked the AI to help me brainstorm some potential solutions and if there were any existing third-party products that may be incorporated. The AI seemed to be misunderstanding the problem, as it initially gave me a solution but when I went down that path, it ended up being a partial or incorrect solution. This happened a few times. It also gave me some library and framework ideas that could help me with my problem, but some of them did not appear to exist upon researching them. For a satisfactory experience, I was having a particularly troublesome bug in my app that I could not track down. I spent a couple of days trying to figure out where the issue was originating with no success. I finally outlined the issue I was experiencing, when it was happening and when it was not occurring, and where it seemed to be occurring. The AI was able to help me pinpoint the code that was causing a side effect in another piece of code, which having trouble tracking it, within the hour.

AI: Those are two very different experiences. That bug-hunting success sounds like it really saved you significant time after those couple of frustrating days.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Even if AI could potentially take over some areas, I would want to keep my skills sharp in those areas so that I am able know what AI is doing and how it works. I am happy to have AI help me speed up my work and improve my output, but I am hesitant to offload any significant sections to it as if there is ever an issue, I want to be able to understand it to be able to either take over doing it or solve the issue.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - maintaining your expertise so you can stay in control and troubleshoot when needed.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision using it as almost a pair-programming buddy in the future to bounce ideas off of and speed up my output. I hope to be able to offload even more of the tedious work tasks I have so I can focus on the more complex issues

AI: That "pair-programming buddy" analogy is a great way to describe it - keeping that collaborative element while handling more of the routine work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining expertise even in areas where AI could help, and how you've found that sweet spot of using it for efficiency while keeping control over the core logic.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that was all of it

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with maintaining technical expertise, and how you navigate the difference between team enthusiasm and organizational caution, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through both your satisfying and frustrating experiences - that kind of honest perspective is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are really working in practice.

Have a great rest of your day!
