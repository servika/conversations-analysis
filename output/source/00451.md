Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for revising emails and memos. I also use it for some data analysis, mainly trying to find patterns in performance-related data.

AI: Tell me more about that data analysis work. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: Our work involves conducting surveys with respondents over the phone. We are always trying to improve our productivity - the number of surveys we complete (completes per hour/CPH). I will ask a chatbot to look at a project's CPH over a period of time and identify any patterns in performance, like correlation between the CPH and the day of the week, or the number of hours spent on the project and the CPH. I'll also ask it to look at some information about the phone numbers we're calling (time zone, state, how many times we have called that #, etc.) and ask it to identify which types of people, if any, are more likely to complete the survey.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're using AI to uncover insights that could really impact your team's efficiency. When you're working through that analysis process, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you feed it all the data at once and ask for a complete analysis, or do you work through it step by step together?

User: It depends. I try to provide as much information as possible up front (all of the data and a paragraph explaining what I'm looking for), but then end up needing to provide some clarification and additional details after the model makes its first attempt at answering the question.

AI: What kinds of clarification do you usually need to provide? Can you walk me through what that back-and-forth typically looks like?

User: Sometimes the data includes abbreviations/acronyms, so I'll need to clarify what those terms mean. Other times, I'll need to ask it to exclude certain information (for example, we usually don't work on Sundays so if we did work one Sunday, I would likely want it to ignore that data). I have also needed to clarify that, when looking at multiple projects, a higher CPH on one project doesn't necessarily mean it is performing better - all projects have an estimated CPH, so to understand performance, the actual CPH needs to be compared with the estimated CPH. So essentially, the clarifications usually involve providing some additional details about how our business works.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially teaching the AI about the nuances of your business context. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: No, I can't really think of anything. Maybe I just haven't thought enough about it, but I feel that most of my tasks can't be done by AI.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you see clear boundaries around what AI can and can't handle in your role. What is it about most of your tasks that makes them feel like they can't be done by AI?

User: Most of my work is done in a system where we can see the number of completed surveys for each type of respondent we are targeting (based on gender, location, etc.) so I have to monitor those surveys and "hide" the applicable sample records when we have met our target. This is all done in a particular program, so I don't see how AI could help unless it was built directly into that program. I also work with staff timesheets (eg. adding a comment when someone is sick, adjusting time entries) so again, unless there was somehow AI incorporated into the timesheet system, I don't see how it could help.

AI: That's a great point - it sounds like a lot of your work is tied to specific proprietary systems that AI can't directly access. Beyond those system-based tasks, when you do use AI for things like email revision and data analysis, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach using AI?

User: We are strongly encouraged to make use of AI, so I have been trying to think of more things that I can use it for. Of course, there is also a heavy emphasis on making sure not to share confidential client or employee information, so I do tend to err on the side of caution if I'm unsure if something is okay to use AI for or not.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was able to get AI to help me identify the best days to work on certain projects that had not been performing well. The conversation was a bit frustrating at first because, like I was mentioning earlier, I needed to explain a lot of things related to how our company works, what certain terms mean, etc., but eventually I was able to get it to identify significant differences in performance based on the day of the week. I was able to take this information to my manager and ask for the projects to be scheduled based on this information, which ended up resulting in a significant improvement in performance. This discovery required looking at a lot of data, so although it's something that could have been done without AI, we probably wouldn't have found the time for it - so AI was a huge help!

AI: That's a powerful example - finding actionable insights that actually improved performance and that might not have been discovered otherwise. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: That's something I have thought about, but I guess my focus has been on learning new skills, including how to work with AI effectively, that will still be needed in the future.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I don't expect there to be too many changes. Like I mentioned earlier, most of my work involves specific systems that AI currently can't access. The biggest change would be if AI was incorporated into those systems - it may make me less important, but at the same time, a human would still need to be involved for a lot of the tasks for knowledge-related reasons. For example, if a staff member is sick for work, AI isn't just going to know that and be able to handle their timesheet, I would at least need to be involved in inputting that they are sick.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helped you discover those day-of-week patterns that led to real performance improvements - that's exactly the kind of collaborative discovery we're interested in understanding.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think we've covered everything :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI capabilities and the need for human context and system access will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
