Assistant: Hi there, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I don't think I have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: One of the projects that I work on the most is basically the creative part of the process for selecting and preparing an episode for my history podcast, which falls more specifically into the realm of ASMR History for sleep. I choose a story or two related stories form either a specific event in history or a couple of related history topics and then tell a story for about 45 minutes or so.  I use AI to help me brainstorm ideas for my next "episode," help me complete outlines for the research, find sources for my actual research, and write a script that I will then use to record the episode.  For instnace, I was having trouble picking a topic a few weeks ago and with the help of a model that asked several questions, we settled on the story of the "Fall of Constantinople" and then created an outline.  The episode should be out in 2 weeks, so I am working on research now and will return with a tentative script that a model will help me "clean up," or edit for recording.

AI: That's fascinating - I love how you've found such a specific niche with ASMR history for sleep. It sounds like AI is woven throughout multiple stages of your creative process.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: At the beginning of the process, not every time, but often, for brainstorming the topic.  Then a quick, rough "outline" to help kickstart the research.  Then I return just before recording usually, or if I'm having trouble with sources I might ask for help in the middle of research.  But then I return to see if there is any advice the model might give me on "cleaning up" the script to make it flow more like a seamless story.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you're using AI as both a creative partner and an editor at different points. You mentioned that you don't always use AI for brainstorming topics, just sometimes.

Tell me more about that. What determines when you reach for AI versus when you come up with topics on your own?

User: It really comes down to how creative I am feeling in the moment, or sometimes how my week has gone.  As a person attending grad school for history, sometimes there is a topic brought up in my classes that really captures my attention and I devote an episode to that.  Sometimes I have "writer's block" and need a little help, which is when I turn to the model for inspiration.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a creative boost when you need it rather than a constant crutch. I'm curious about that collaboration when you do have writer's block.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, to go back to the "Fall of Constantinople" project, it was during the summer. I was not in class, I had not done much reading that week, and felt a little burnt out.  I had a conversation with an AI model that I had used enough in the past that it knew which eras of history I generally showed more interest in, and asked for a brainstorming session.  The model did a decent job of shouldering some of the burden of the conversation and eventually suggested a story on Mehmet I, who was the ruler that overthrew Constantinople in 1453, which sparked my interest to do that story on that. There are plenty of secondary sources on that topic, so I did not really need help with the research, but my notes were actually a little too detailed and the story was going to be very long.  So I returned and asked the model to trim approximately 10 minutes worth of time. It did fairly well at keeping the key points in and removing some extraneous chatter.  It helped ease some of the stress I was feeling to produce an episode as well as remove points, which I loathe, because I've usually worked pretty hard to come up with the script.  So it helps me out to have AI remove some content for me, because it can be difficult for me to choose.

AI: That's such a vivid example - I can really hear how AI helped you navigate both the creative block and the editorial challenge of cutting content you'd worked hard on. It sounds like there was real emotional relief there.

When you're working with AI like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It depends.  Like I said in the previous example, there are times when I am feeling very overwhelmed and can't really shoulder the weight of being creative and I might require a bit more input in those times.  Other times, I just ask the model what it thinks of MY ideas, and I usually get pretty good feedback, although sometimes I have to remind the model that it is okay to give a critique that is not fully positive, or gives more tips. So it goes back and forth depending on my mood.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about having to encourage the AI to give you honest critique rather than just positive feedback. It sounds like you've developed quite a nuanced working relationship where you're actively managing the dynamic based on what you need.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Surprisingly, I think my own research skills have actually improved (although I've always loved research and done well at it). This is because I remember not to just take the model at its word 100% of the time, as AI models make mistakes just like humans, and so double checking some of the information interjected by a model helps me to deepen my own research abilities.  I also think that using AI in the last editing stage helps me deliver a more polished and smooth podcast overall when it is published.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like working with AI has actually sharpened your critical thinking and made you a more careful researcher. I wouldn't have expected that outcome.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: The injection of AI voices and completely AI written scripts have garnered a small following, but as most people prefer human voices, right now this is not a top concern, but it is still in the back of my mind.  There are some people who use completely AI written scripts as well, but for now, these are usually pretty easy to pick up on.  That being said, as the tech improves, so will the scripts and voices.  I am not a person who thinks that this is the end of the world, however.  Because it is just an opportunity for me to pivot myself and potentially launch the podcast in a different direction myself using the technology, so while there are some concerns, it all comes down to an ability to adapt.

AI: That's a really thoughtful and adaptive perspective - seeing it more as an evolution to navigate rather than a threat to resist. Your attitude about pivoting and using the technology yourself is quite pragmatic.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would anticipate that audio-processing AI will become more advanced, which would be a benefit for myself.  Listening back to recorded episodes, editing and basically "splicing" in edited sections is a difficult and time consuiming part of my work, even though there are some tools that exist now to assist with that. But as the tech gets more advanced, it would be nice to pass that job off to an AI completely, as it is my least favorite part of the whole process.

AI: That makes perfect sense - automating the tedious technical work so you can focus on the creative storytelling aspects you clearly love.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has actually improved your research skills by making you more vigilant about fact-checking, and your adaptive approach to viewing AI developments as opportunities rather than just threats.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a flexible creative partner - sometimes for brainstorming when you're stuck, sometimes for editing help, and how it's actually strengthened your research skills - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how honest you were about the different ways you engage with AI depending on your energy and needs. That nuanced approach to the collaboration is exactly the kind of authentic experience we're hoping to understand better.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your Fall of Constantinople episode!
