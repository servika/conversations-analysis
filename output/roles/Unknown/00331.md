Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I think that sounds great.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do a high volume of reading and writing on complex regulatory topics. These are primarily in the utility industry concerning natural gas, but also occasionally electric, and span across four states in the Northeast. Each state has its own regulatory structure, agencies, consumer groups etc. So it makes for a lot of information. I often use AI to summarize new regulatory documents (orders, testimony, exhibits, etc) or to create quick primers on regulatory processes to date.

AI: That sounds like a really information-dense field with a lot of moving pieces across different jurisdictions. 

When you're using AI to summarize those regulatory documents or create primers, how do you typically work with it? Do you feed it the raw documents and let it produce a summary independently, or do you find yourself guiding it through the process more collaboratively?

User: It depends. I  usually start by providing the AI the document or documents I am using. Then I will ask the AI to produce a summary of the top 5-10 points of each chapter, usually in 1-2 pages. I will then read through what the AI gave me and then go back and skim through the document. If I feel like the AI covered the major chapter topics I may ask follow-up questions. If it seems like the AI skipped major chapters or topics I will focus on those with the AI and ask more specific questions.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using the AI's initial summary as a starting point and then validating it against the source material. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your regulatory work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are some tasks that will be reviewed by our legal department and have specific style and formatting requirements. I often like to handle those myself. I would not want a minor style or formatting error to delay a time sensitive filing. I do often also like to produce the writing in those documents myself. I may ask an AI to review what I've written in those cases, for clarity and grammar, etc.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - especially when there are legal implications and strict requirements at stake. It sounds like you maintain control over the high-stakes writing but still find value in having AI as a reviewer.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you tend to collaborate with it throughout a task rather than just handing something off completely. Is that accurate, or does it vary depending on the situation?

User: That is accurate. Often I am reading the documents for the first time, and may not know all of the things that I need to follow-up on. As I identify those areas with AI, our conversation expands.

AI: That's fascinating - so the AI is almost helping you discover what questions you need to ask as you're learning about these new regulatory developments together.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your organization using it similarly, or have you found your own approach?

User: I think the organization promotes and supports the use of AI. It is common practice on my team to use AI in the way I describe. I'm sure others use it for more complex modeling and forecasting.

AI: It sounds like you're working in an environment that's really embraced AI as a tool. That's interesting that others might be using it for more complex analytical work like modeling.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt particularly satisfied when I was able to produce a report from 20-30 pages of meeting notes in just 2 hours. I was under a very tight deadline and would have needed more than 2hrs (without AI) to distill, organize, synthesize, and analyze the notes into a report.

AI: That sounds like a real game-changer for that deadline situation. Being able to synthesize that volume of meeting notes into a coherent report in just two hours must have been a huge relief.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your work?

User: Sometimes I consider that possibility, but that seems far away from where things currently stand. Currently, AI is more of a tool in the toolbox than something I fear will take over my job.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - seeing AI as another tool rather than a replacement threat.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops, or expanding into different areas of your regulatory work?

User: I could see it expanding. If the models become more proficient at extracting and synthesizing regulatory information they could write more final products.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that collaborative discovery process - using AI to help identify what questions you need to ask as you're learning about new regulatory developments together.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner in complex regulatory work - especially that iterative process of summarizing, validating, and then drilling deeper - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
