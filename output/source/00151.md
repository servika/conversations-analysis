Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds wonderful to me. I am ready to start; I have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a gardener, meaning I maintain the flowers and plants of many different people through watering them consistently, and adding fertilizer when needed. The only times I feel like I've utilized AI is when I have a very specific question about the health of a plant that is not answered in a google search. AI is better at asking questions to pinpoint exactly what is happening and what I should do for the plant to keep it healthy and looking good.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI serves as a more interactive diagnostic tool for you when you encounter plant health issues that aren't easily resolved through traditional searches.

Can you walk me through what one of those interactions typically looks like? What kind of back-and-forth do you have with AI when you're trying to figure out what's wrong with a plant?

User: Sure, so for example I might notice that despite the amount I water a certain plant staying consistent, the plant's appearance will suddenly begin to change for the worse. This could by leaves falling off or the leaves turning darker and drooping down, or maybe the leaves are shriveling up. There's plenty more examples I could provide but after I ask something along the lines of what I described previously, AI will ask follow up questions. The AI will then usually ask a combination of a few of these questions and others, it will ask if the plant is indoor or outdoor, what type of plant it is, what the climate is like where I am working, and if it has rained recently. I then provide it all the information needed and it can give me an educated answer of what step I should take to return the plant to its full health.

AI: That sounds like a really valuable diagnostic process. I'm curious about the questions AI asks you - do you find that those follow-up questions help you think about aspects of plant care that you might not have considered on your own, or are they typically things you already knew to look for but just needed to communicate to get a better answer?

User: I'd say at this point I know to consider all of those factors it just definitely helps to receive a second opinion, especially when messing it up means the plant will likely be dead or too far gone to save by the next time I return to water/maintain. However, when I was first starting to learn how to garden I did not have much experience so asking AI these questions certainly made me think of factors I otherwise wouldn't

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - how AI's role has shifted for you as your expertise has grown. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your gardening work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I'd say some things I don't ask AI is how to decorate the plants to make the garden look as beautiful as possible. The reason I don't ask AI this is because I haven't found AI's decorative abilities to be superior to mine quite yet, I value my own opinion more. I think the reason I hold this believe is because I take pride in having a vision and then making that vision come to life. Even if AI was better at providing decorative advice then myself I still probably wouldn't use it because of that joy I get for creating my vision.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're making - it sounds like there's something about the creative and visionary aspects of your work that feel fundamentally different from the diagnostic problem-solving where AI excels.

When you use AI for those plant health diagnostics, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it throughout troubleshooting a problem, or do you tend to present the issue, get your answer, and then go implement the solution on your own?

User: I'd say the latter is true for me. I present the issue and symptoms, the AI eventually gives me an educated answer, and then I go ahead and implement what I think is best for the plant.

AI: That makes sense - so it's more of a consultation model where you gather the information you need and then take it from there.

How have your colleagues or clients influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they know you use it, and if so, how do they feel about it?

User: The clients I work for do not know I use AI, but I highly doubt they would care, as all that matters is the health and appearance of the plants, not the way in which I learned how to maintain the garden.

AI: That's an interesting perspective on what clients ultimately value. 

Can you share a time when using AI for plant diagnostics made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Oh I have a great example, there was two identical pots of plants on one of my client's front porch. I had always watered the plants for the same amount of time and they were both sat under a roof so there was no way rain water would be affecting the health of the plant. I noticed that one of the plants, despite being identical to the other and receiving identical treatment, began growing darker, especially on its leaves and stems, and began to droop down. I was confused as to why this was so I consulted the AI. After running through multiple questions the AI eventually asked if the pot was draining water or not. I then realized that the pot usually always drains the water out but this time it wasn't. It was then that I realized that the drain had been blocked somehow, and after further inspection, I discovered that the plant's root had plugged the only draining hole leading to the plant becoming waterlogged. After I sliced this root off, the plant returned to draining and full health.

AI: That's a perfect example of how the AI's systematic questioning helped you identify something you might have missed on your own. It sounds like that diagnostic process was really satisfying when it led to solving the mystery.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in plant care and diagnostics, knowing that AI is there as a resource? Is this something you actively consider as you develop your expertise?

User: I would be confident that I would maintain my skills even without AI's help now that I have gained so much experience. However, with AI being an available resource to me, I am even more certain that I will be able to maintain this skill and even potentially further my skill and expertise in the future with AI's help.

AI: That's a really confident outlook - seeing AI as enhancing rather than replacing your developing expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI in your gardening work evolving? Do you think you'll use it differently as you gain even more experience, or do you see it continuing in this diagnostic consultation role?

User: I see AI continuing in this diagnostic role, I have not yet found another use personally for AI in my work.

AI: That makes a lot of sense given how well that diagnostic role is working for you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared, and you've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your gardening work. I particularly appreciated your example about the blocked drainage - it really illustrated how AI's systematic questioning can help even experienced professionals spot things they might miss.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience using AI in your gardening work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that might give us additional insight into how you interact with AI tools?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a diagnostic consultant while maintaining your creative ownership of the aesthetic aspects of gardening have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Your perspective on how AI's role has evolved as your expertise has grown - from teaching you new factors to consider early on, to now serving as a reliable second opinion for complex plant health issues - gives us valuable insight into how these relationships can develop over time.

Thanks again for participating in our research!
