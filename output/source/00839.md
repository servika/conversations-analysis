Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it mainly for help with writing up audits, creating documentation / literature for the practice and help with staffing issues

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you across several different areas of your work. 

When you mention using it for writing up audits, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: It usually will be me typing in my findings in quite 'simple' language, and then me asking it to rewrite the text to sound more professional

AI: That's a really practical approach - using AI to help polish your language while keeping your original findings and insights intact.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I will always give any task a go with AI to see if it works well, and if it doesn't then I will do it myself.  I use specific software for a good portion of my work so I can't use AI for that

AI: That makes sense - so you take an experimental approach, testing AI's capabilities on different tasks to see what works.

When you do use AI for tasks like rewriting your audit findings or creating documentation, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it everything at once and let it handle it independently?

User: I normally go back and forth throughout the task, however just yesterday I did try a more 'independent' approach, but found I had to then go back and forth with some tweaks

AI: That's a great example of how you're experimenting with different approaches. It sounds like the back-and-forth method tends to work better for you.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: No I don't think so....as I am a manager, I do a lot of my work independently.

AI: That makes sense - having that independence as a manager gives you the freedom to experiment and find what works for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yesterday I had a frustrating day with AI lol!  I was trying to have it create a document to help my train new trainee dental nurses how to conduct dental charting.  I asked for an image / diagram showing teeth with labels indicating the names of the teeth, i.e, incisors, lateral incisors, canines, premolars, molars but it just kept getting the teeth wrongly labelled.  I had to give up in the end and search online for a suitable diagram instead

AI: Oh that does sound frustrating! It's interesting that AI handled the text rewriting so well for your audits, but struggled with something that seems straightforward like labeling teeth correctly.

When you had to abandon that task and search online instead, how did that make you feel about using AI for future projects?

User: No real impact really.  I used most of the other work it gave me, and just added in my own portions that i needed to.  I try to have a realistic approach with the AI tools - they are still learning too, which is why I don't want to be too dependant on it and I tend to use the back and forth options

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - recognizing both the capabilities and limitations while staying adaptable. Your "realistic approach" seems to serve you well.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Can you elaborate on this question>

AI: Of course! I'm thinking about situations where AI becomes really good at tasks you currently do - like if AI got much better at writing professional documentation or creating training materials. 

Do you ever worry about losing your own skills in those areas if you rely on AI too much? Or do you think about making sure you can still do those tasks well yourself?

User: I haven't really thought about this to be honest....I suppose I feel that I shouldn't lose the skills I already have?

AI: That's totally understandable - it's not something everyone thinks about actively. It sounds like you naturally maintain that balance by trying things yourself first and staying involved in the back-and-forth process.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it evolving well and it becoming a really super tool to continue to help me with the aspects of my job that are time consuming

AI: That's a really practical way to think about it - focusing on how AI can help with the time-consuming parts of your work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your realistic approach to testing AI's capabilities and your balanced perspective on its limitations - like with the dental charting example yesterday.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about experimenting with AI, maintaining that back-and-forth collaborative approach, and keeping realistic expectations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: :)

AI: :) Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
