Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use it for brainstorming. I am a teacher at a homeschool co-op. When I need ideas for activities or assignments, I will ask AI for ideas. Occasionally, if a student asks a question I don't know the answer to, we ask AI.

AI: That sounds like a really practical way to use AI in your teaching. When you're brainstorming activities or assignments with AI, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: If, for example, I am planning a novel study, I will ask AI for examples of essay questions, comprehension questions for each chapter, or ideas for projects to assign at the end of the novel.

AI: That's helpful context. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to do all factual research myself, as I know that AI is wrong sometimes. I also prefer to do any communicative writing myself, as my written communications sound more natural than AI. These tasks are different from the brainstorming tasks that I usually assign to AI because they are requesting an end product, while the brainstorming tasks are asking for a jumping off point (ideas that I can take further on my own.)

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - using AI as a jumping off point versus for an end product. When you do use AI for brainstorming those novel study ideas, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the planning process, or do you tend to ask for a batch of ideas and then work independently from there?

User: I tend to ask for a batch of ideas and then go from there. I'll take the ideas given by AI and do a web search if I want to see more information about the idea or to see examples of it. Occasionally I will ask AI to refine the suggestions.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: No. A lot of co-workers use AI for brainstorming as well. There are some who use it for research or communications, but I still prefer not to.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I needed to set up plans for a substitute teach unexpectedly. I knew that I would not be there to to implement the class's original plans, so I decided to have the students read their assigned chapters and have them answer comprehension questions afterward. I used AI to quickly generate a list of ten questions for those chapters. It significantly lessened the time it would normally take to leave plans for a substitute.

AI: That sounds like it really saved you in a pinch. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it is very important to maintain research skills, writing (both creative and communicative), and critical thinking skills. Just because AI can do these things, does not mean it can do it well. I never want to rely on AI to the point that I accept it as always correct or that I lose my own ability in these areas. I believe that AI is a good tool to work with collaboratively, but not as a replacement for anything.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will continue to use it for brainstorming ideas, but will always be weary of it for factual knowledge and communications.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between using AI as a starting point for brainstorming versus relying on it for end products, and your intentional approach to maintaining your core skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative brainstorming tool while maintaining clear boundaries around research and communication will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
