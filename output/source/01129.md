Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! I don't have any questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: You bet. I design and hand-paint custom shoes for people. A typical project includes planning the shoe design digitally, which is usually what takes longest. Once I have the thumbs up from the customer, I sketch the design onto the shoe. I then use paints and brushes to paint the design onto the shoe, using a matte protectant to seal and protect the design when finished.

AI: That sounds like such a unique and personal form of art! I love that you're creating something so customized for each person.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I reach to AI quite frequently throughout the process. Sometimes I use it to help me write emails if I am feeling overwhelmed or nervous about certain customers. I use it to help me come up with ideas for what to put where on my shoe designs. I also use it to discuss color combinations and how they would look on certain parts of the shoe. If I'm facing serious artist's block, I'll have it make some designs for me to gain inspiration from. I NEVER copy these designs - they are used strictly to inspire unique ideas for myself. I also ask it for recommendations on different types of paints and sealer, if I'm wanting to switch my materials up a bit.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into different stages of your work, from the business side with emails all the way through to materials advice.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: [REDACTED] Yeah! I recently did a commissioned pair of Attack on Titan shoes. When I started out, I wasn't really sure how I wanted to represent the characters on the shoes. Positioning is super important; the shape of the shoe can really distort characters, if they're not placed right. To help me, I had the model make a few different shoe layouts for me, each with the characters facing certain directions. I was able to find a position that fit very nicely on the shoe. I also had it help me figure out which color would be best for the background. It was incredibly helpful to have the support - it made the project run so much smoother, which was really needed at the time. I was lined up with 11 different commissions, so it made all the difference. I'll attach a picture of how the shoes turned out! The picture honestly makes them look a little weird, but I promise they look pretty perfect in person, haha.

AI: Wow, those shoes look incredible! The character positioning really does work perfectly with the shape of the shoe - you can see how much thought went into that placement. And that gradient background is striking.

When you're working with AI like you did on this project - getting layout suggestions and color advice - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The collaboration was great, but there were a few frustrations. I can't blame AI for not being able to produce a perfect shoe with a perfect design idea, you know? It did take a few tries before we could elaborate on design ideas that I liked. Fine-tuning was frustrating. When it came to the non-visual collaboration, everything was very smooth and easy. I definitely felt as if the give and take was equal at some points. When I felt like my creative juices just weren't flowing, the model gave me some creative ideas that really pulled me out of it. For the most part, I was the driving creative force, and the AI model was just the icing on the cake to help ensure I captured everything perfectly.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - you as the driving creative force and AI as the "icing on the cake." It sounds like you've found a balance where you maintain creative ownership while using AI as a creative partner when you need that extra push.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I feel as if my creative playing field has been substantially increased. Before, I definitely felt limited to what I could conjure up in my mind. Now, I am able to get ideas and inspiration from the suggestions AI gives me. I am able to think of things that I never would have on my own. So I would say that my motivation, attention to detail, and ability to create are all aspects of my creative work that have improved since using AI.

AI: That expansion of your creative playing field sounds really empowering - going from being limited by what you could conjure up on your own to having this broader landscape of possibilities to explore.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have a LOT of concerns. The more AI learns, the better it becomes at mimicking humanity and human creations. I worry that true artists, like myself, will be entirely replaced by what is easily replicated by AI. I am so worried that true human expression will be outplayed by limitless AI ability.

AI: That's such an honest and deeply felt concern - the fear that the very thing that's helping expand your creative possibilities could eventually replace the human expression that makes your work uniquely yours.

Tell me more about what you mean by "true human expression" - what is it about your work that you feel AI can't replicate?

User: It can't replicate the strokes of paint that I put on the shoes. It can't replicate the earnest feeling that is dug into every pen stroke on a drawing that I pour my heart into. It can't replicate the smell of the paint as it dries, or the hours of effort and planning that go into each and every shoe or drawing. It's so frightening that something that took me almost 20 hours can be created in a matter of seconds with AI.

AI: The way you describe those physical, sensory, and emotional elements - the actual paint strokes, the heart poured into each pen stroke, even the smell of drying paint - those are such profound aspects of the creative process that go far beyond just the final visual result.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll continue using it as that "icing on the cake," or do you see the relationship changing?

User: I do think that I will continue to use it as my icing. It is truly helpful. However, if I hear word from the artist community that we need to make an effort to stop AI use, I'll happily comply. I don't want to be a part of something that ultimately reduces the value of human creativity.

AI: That willingness to step away from something that's genuinely helpful to you if it threatens the broader creative community really speaks to your values as an artist and your commitment to preserving human creativity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how you described that tension between AI expanding your creative playing field while simultaneously worrying about it potentially replacing the deeply human elements of your work - those paint strokes, that earnest feeling, the hours of effort that can't be replicated.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between using AI as a creative tool while preserving the irreplaceable human elements of your artistry will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Best of luck with your upcoming commissions, and thank you for creating such beautiful, personalized art for your customers!
