Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a writer, a freelance author, editor, and indie publisher. I have written and published a couple of nonfiction books about fibromyalgia on Amazon, and done editing and assisted with publishing on about 5 other books written by other authors. A project I'm currently working on is a devotional intended for people with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, or other chronic illness, focused toward helping them figure out how they function according to God's will for their lives, and it's intended to be the first in a series of devotionals, each one with 40 days or entries, and each one also designed to encourage journaling, so each entry/day will include a journaling prompt at the end, and the print version will have a few pages of ruled paper for journaling after each devotional. I am working right now on the content of the first one, and once I have it finished, arranged, edited, etc, I will design the cover and publish it to Amazon and possibly other avenues, in digital and paperback versions. does that answer sufficiently?

AI: That's a wonderful overview, thank you. It sounds like you have a really comprehensive approach to the publishing process - from writing through design and distribution. The devotional series sounds like a meaningful project, especially with the journaling component.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: For my writing and publishing, I typically use AI quite a bit in the research phase, especially in searching out bible verses or passages that fit the material/subject matter, and especially finding verses that aren't as commonly used for what I'm writing about. For example, in my current book, Habakkuk is coming into play quite a bit. Then I will sometimes reach out to AI for help if I get stuck during my writing with what to say about something or how to express a particular idea. I tend, in my own words, to get too wordy sometimes, and sometimes I have trouble being direct or efficient in expressing an idea, so I'll use AI to get feedback or ideas on how I can say something. And then in the editing phase, I am an avid proofreader, but I will use AI to double check my work and get final feedback. Also to find things that might not be super obvious, like an extra space where it doesn't belong. I have not previously used it for cover design, but I might end up incorporating some of that going forward.

AI: That's really interesting how you've integrated AI across multiple phases - from research through final proofreading. I'm particularly intrigued by your use of AI for finding less commonly used biblical passages like from Habakkuk.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I haven't had other major projects, because I've been working on the current one off and on for awhile , and have recently dealt with a lot of illness. But I can tell you that kind of a sub-portion of the current project where AI was quite useful was when I needed to figure out how to organize my devotionals for the book. I had all of these devotionals which I had written individually but didn't want to just put them in a random order, or something kind of arbitrary like alphabetical, and I didn't necessarily want to go in biblical order by the passage I used for each one, but something that would be meaningful for the readers. So through discussions with a couple of models I was able to decide on 8 categories, with each one having 4 smaller devotionals, and 1 that was more comprehensive, so that it was essentially 8 sets of 5 devotionals, with each covering an area like accepting your illness or God's path, understanding why God allows illness in His followers and how He uses it, and ways that we can still serve and God can still use us, despite, or even because of, our challenges. That help in coming up with the 8 subdivisions, and especially in organizing the devotionals into categories, was incredibly helpful. I felt overwhelmed going in, but by the end I was very grateful for this new tool.

AI: That sounds like such a valuable collaboration - taking what could have been an overwhelming organizational challenge and turning it into a meaningful structure for your readers. I love how you ended up with that thoughtful framework of 8 categories with 5 devotionals each.

When you're working with AI like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It's usually me in the driver's seat, but the models I've used have been very collaborative, making helpful suggestions that sometimes I would never have thought of- so although the AI isn't making the creative decisions, it is very creatively involved in the collab.

AI: That's a great way to put it - you're driving but the AI is creatively involved in the collaboration. It sounds like there's a real back-and-forth happening where the AI can surprise you with suggestions you wouldn't have considered.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'd say it primarily has just become a bit faster and easier, like when I used to do all manual proofreading/editing, it took a lot longer because I would read and reread, literally forward and backward, to make sure I caught everything, and then I would do word level, sentence level, and paragraph level edits, with multiple rereads for each. Now I don't have to spend quite so much  time on it. And creatively, it's been a great sounding board for ideas, like with the organization of the book, where I can tell it what I am trying to do from a very high level, and ask for thoughts and ideas on how to accomplish it, and we can go back and forth with iterations of the ideas, and it will make suggestions that I might not go with precisely but will sometimes spark a different way of viewing things that will help me decide on the right approach.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - AI as both a time-saver and a creative sounding board. It sounds like it's particularly valuable in those moments where you need to step back and see your work from a different angle.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: For myself I don't really have particular concerns on an individual level, but for my field I have concerns in people leaning too heavily on AI for writing and creative tasks, and its impact on people's ability to think for themselves. I have heard people (or read, on social media, forums, etc) talking about that they just put in a high level concept and tell the ai to write a chapter, and then another, and it basically writes the whole book for them. I am concerned that will lead to a lot of books that are very derivative and ultimately restatements of the same things, but not truly creative. And similarly, maybe more importantly, it's being used, to my understanding, by students for creative tasks in schools, and I'm very concerned about the impact that will have on their learning to think and reason on their own, not to mention the ability to simply write something coherent.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns about the broader implications. It sounds like you see a real distinction between using AI as a collaborative tool - like you do - versus having it generate entire pieces of work. The point about students particularly resonates - that there's something important about learning to think through problems yourself.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'm not really sure yet- to some extent it might depend on how AI itself evolves. But I am fairly set on the idea that creative works need to originate from the human brain, and that I really don't think people should be able to publish and receive royalties from something that was mostly produced by AI... I don't have a problem with that stuff being put out there, but It feels wrong to me that someone can claim a "creative" work, when they didn't really do any of the creating themselves, if that makes sense. I have a real thing about that, so I, myself, will probably continue to do the bulk of my writing the old fashioned way, and as you said, use AI as a tool for brainstorming, organization, research, etc, and double-checking my work for mistakes.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that human creative core while leveraging AI as a support tool. Your distinction between creating versus claiming credit for AI-generated work really gets to the heart of some important questions about authorship and creativity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative sounding board while maintaining clear boundaries about where the creative work should originate, and your concerns about the broader implications for both publishing and education.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of at this time. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI as a powerful collaborative tool while preserving the essential human creativity at the core of your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Best of luck with your devotional series - it sounds like a really meaningful project that will help a lot of people. Take care!
