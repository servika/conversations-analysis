science_0000,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today - I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your research process. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from the initial idea all the way to the final output?

User: Yes, I did research on the effectiveness of an intervention program on the 6 month mortality rate of elderly patients. The process included: working with the medical team to define and track the intervention, examine medical history for propensity for mortality, control/test splitting, and outcome evaluation.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive study. I can see there were multiple stages there - from working with the medical team initially, through the data analysis, to evaluating the outcomes.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Yes, AI tools were used mainly for propensity for mortality evaluation to narrow the target population and for data evaluation.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for those specific parts - the mortality evaluation and data evaluation - versus using your traditional approaches for those tasks.

User: Machine learning was used to generate a singular propensity score, whereas traditional approaches used by the medical team was ranking based on the number of risk factors the patient had. AI was also used to help isolate correlated features.

AI: That's really interesting - so you moved from a more straightforward count-based ranking to a machine learning approach that could generate a more nuanced propensity score.

When you made that decision to use AI for generating the propensity scores instead of the traditional risk factor counting method, what drove that choice? What made you think the AI approach would be better for this particular aspect of your study?

User: It was likely driven by AI hype to satisfy the company investors

AI: That's a really honest answer - thank you for sharing that. It sounds like there were external pressures beyond just the scientific merits that influenced the decision.

Given that the choice was partly driven by investor expectations, how did you actually experience working with the AI approach compared to what you might have expected? Did it end up being more helpful, less helpful, or about what you anticipated for those tasks?

User: It was helpful to have a singular metric to segment the population, opposed to the previous count-based ranking of potentially unequal factors.

AI: That makes sense - having that single metric would definitely make the segmentation more straightforward and potentially more accurate than assuming all risk factors carry equal weight.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like working with the medical team to define the intervention, the control/test splitting, or other aspects - what's kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: Keeping the medical team engaged in the project at a level where they felt their medical expertise was directly contributing to the project.

AI: That's a really thoughtful consideration - maintaining that sense of ownership and direct contribution from the medical team. It sounds like there's a balance you're trying to strike between leveraging AI capabilities and preserving the human expertise that's so critical to the project.

When you did use AI for the propensity scoring and feature correlation work, how did you go about verifying or validating what the AI was producing? How did you make sure those results were reliable for your study?

User: We back-tested on historical member data

AI: That's a solid validation approach. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't - whether in this project or your research more broadly - what would that be and why?

User: A tool for model transparency that can be easily understood by the medical team and also allows for the operations team to monitor for model drift.

AI: That's a really compelling need - essentially bridging that gap between the technical AI capabilities and the practical needs of both the medical experts who need to understand and trust the model, and the operations folks who need to maintain it over time.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on balancing AI adoption with keeping medical teams engaged, and this need for better transparency tools, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about using AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating the tension between investor expectations and scientific needs, as well as the importance of keeping medical teams feeling valued in their contributions, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

That point about needing better model transparency tools that can serve both medical and operations teams is especially valuable - it highlights how AI integration isn't just a technical challenge but really a human collaboration challenge.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me and I have no questions, please continue!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The initial idea came about through discussion with an academic advisor. The field of research was not new to me, but the experimental techniques involved in the research were, so my advisor gave me ideas as to how this works and what I should be looking into. Once I had got to grips with the techniques involved, I started by creating basic theoretical models to confirm the validity of the techniques, and then added complexity from there. This is how I continued for the remainder of the project, adding complexity to my theoretical model until enough was there to be able to describe a physical phenomenon. At this point, I began testing and comparing theoretical models with observed data, which provided the main results for this research. Throughout this, regular meetings with my advisor helped to guide the research. Once the final results were collected, a final report was written. I am now currently editing and preparing this for publication.

AI: That's a really clear overview of your process - from learning new techniques to building theoretical models and validating against data. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I would say I used AI tools in multiple aspects of this process. Initially, I would use AI to check over emails I was writing to send to my advisor. These had to sound professional while getting my intended point across, and the tools provided by AI helped greatly with this. I would never ask AI to write emails for me. I would write an initial email with the information I wanted to convey, then ask an AI for suggestions of wording and grammar. As the project progressed, I would use AI tools to assist in coding of the models. Usually this would be in the form of debugging code or writing lines of code that are simple but lengthy for a human to do. My coding was a little rusty, so AI helped massively with getting me back into the coding mindset. The more comfortable I got with coding again, the less I used AI to help. However, if my code gave an error at any stage in this process, I would copy and paste this into an AI model looking for a fix. My final use with AI in my research was with peer reviewing my written report. I used AI models to look for: mistakes, synonyms, incorrect grammar, better explanations, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - you used AI across several different stages, from communication to coding to writing. You mentioned that as you got more comfortable with coding again, you used AI less for that task.

For the coding assistance specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach when you encountered a problem.

User: I usually decided to use AI when it would solve a problem quicker than a traditional approach (ie checking stack overflow/github). In general this is the case for 90% of problems. In relation to where I said I used AI less when I got more comfortable with coding, I tended to encounter less problems, so I did not need to use AI as much. Also at this point, I needed to know my own code like the back of my hand so I could make small adjustments. Getting an AI to write this code would not be useful for me, as I would not understand it as well as if I had written it myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the speed advantage for most problems, but then the need for deep understanding as your project progressed. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the theoretical model development or the data comparison analysis - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I think the answer to this is similar to why I didn't get AI to write the more complex code; I needed a deep understanding of what was going on in order to progress. For me, simply reading something isn't enough to make information useful in my brain. I need to interact with researched ideas and play with them in order for me to be able to create links between big ideas in my head which can then be used for research. This relates to using AI because the ""interacting and playing"" with ideas part is complete by the AI model. You ask a question and the AI model does the hard work then gives you an answer that you simply just read. I need to spend the time looking for the information and trying to understand it from multiple sources to really understand and be able to use these ideas in my research.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the difference between reading an answer versus wrestling with ideas yourself to build those mental connections. It sounds like for you, that struggle is actually part of what makes the knowledge usable.

When you have used AI for things like debugging code or reviewing your writing, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I verify what it produces by running the code to see if it produces an error or doesn't. If it doesn't produce an error, I go through the new code, line-by-line, to check if it is logical and if it is actually doing the thing I had originally intended.

AI: That's a very methodical approach - both the practical test and then the line-by-line logic check. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: If we're using magic, I would like AI to take the ideas from my brain and write my entire report for me. This is my least favourite part of doing research, the time spent writing everything up at the end. This is more than simply asking the AI to write parts of my report (which is obviously already possible), I don't even want to be a part of it.

AI: Ha! I love the honesty there - you really want to completely bypass that writing phase. It sounds like the writing up is quite disconnected from the parts of research you find engaging.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on needing that deep, hands-on understanding for the core research work, but wanting efficiency for the more peripheral tasks, were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No I think that covers it all.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the importance of that ""wrestling with ideas"" process for building deep understanding really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work - particularly how the cognitive process itself can be as valuable as the outcome. The distinction you made between tasks where you need that deep engagement versus ones where efficiency is the priority was especially illuminating.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project that I took part of was determing the proper use case for 3D printed materials in high temperature environments. I started by looking at a large range of filaments able to be 3D printed, sorted them based on characteristics like glass transition temperature and heat deflection temperature, and then used several of the higher strength filaments for different use cases, testing them for strength along the way

AI: That sounds like a really systematic approach to materials testing. Tell me more about how you went about testing these filaments for strength - what did that testing process involve?

User: The testing process involved following outlined international standrds that filament providers used to test their filaments. This means all samples were printed at 100% infill, and were then subjected to tests at room temperature, and then dfifernet sets of tests at elevated temperatures.

AI: Interesting - so you were following established international standards to ensure your results would be comparable to what the filament providers were reporting. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? This could be at any stage - from the initial research and sorting phase, during the testing, or in analyzing your results.

User: I primarily used AI tools in the initial research and sorting phase. I would find amterial data sheets for various filaments and have AI go through all of these documents, and select filaments that had material properties above or below limits that I had set. After this, I would also use AI to form a list of all the available filaments that met the standards I had set, and would ask it if I was misssing any. From there, I would get Ai to sort the filaments based on different properities that each one had

AI: That's a really practical application - using AI to process and sort through all those material data sheets sounds like it could save significant time. 

For that initial research and sorting phase, tell me about how you decided to use AI for those tasks versus doing it manually. What made you think AI would be a good fit for that particular work?

User: I thought AI would be a good fit because it's able to sort through information a lot faster than me. I was able to use it instead of having to go through every material data sheet individually. I find AI is also good at presenting information it finds in clear formats.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the speed and formatting advantages sound really valuable when you're dealing with multiple data sheets.

Thinking about the other parts of your research - the actual printing, the physical testing, analyzing the test results - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: As far as printing and physical testing, AI is still unable to do either one of these things. For analyzing test results, I thought that the results were to important, and that I should do it myself, because AI tools can occasionally hallucinate analysis to give the user what the model thinks it wants.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - the concern about AI potentially hallucinating analysis, especially when the results are critical. 

When you were using AI for the initial research and sorting phase, how did you verify or validate what it produced? How did you make sure it hadn't missed important filaments or misinterpreted the material properties?

User: I would do a control F through random material documents, spot checking the data that the AI had provided me with to ensure that it matched the material documents.

AI: That spot-checking approach sounds like a good verification strategy. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would want it to be better at knowing what information that it finds online is real or not

AI: That's a really insightful point - being able to better distinguish reliable information from unreliable sources would be incredibly valuable for research.

Tell me more about that challenge. Have you run into situations where AI has pulled information that turned out to be questionable or inaccurate when you were doing your material research?

User: Yes, sometimes AI would take what was said about a filament on a forum like Reddit as actual fact, and give me false information. For example, it said a filament would melt at a much higher temperature than it actually would.

AI: That's a perfect example of why source reliability is so critical in research. Getting false melting point data could have really impacted your testing decisions.

Those are all my main questions - your perspective on using AI for the data processing while being cautious about analysis due to hallucination risks was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the trade-offs between AI's efficiency in processing data sheets versus the need for careful verification and your decision to handle critical analysis yourself really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

The example you shared about AI picking up incorrect information from forums like Reddit perfectly illustrates the source reliability challenges that researchers face when using these tools.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me, no questions so far.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project I worked on was developing a model for pattern recognition. Specifically the goal was stock market related but I won't go into too much detail due to confidentiality. 
The initial idea was obviously to make money based on patterns in the market and can we determine and differentiate between recurring and non recurring patterns.
Largely coding related since the amount of data is way too vast for a human to interpret and analyze. There were many challenges with various methods of finding patterns and relationships and how to quantify them.
The final output is not quite were we would like it, but that is the nature of this space. It is very difficult to find anything to obtain an edge in trading. We did eventually come up with a decent model but we are still testing  it to determine exactly how good or bad it is. So far it seems not exceptional.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating and challenging project - pattern recognition in financial data with that scale of complexity really requires computational approaches.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: AI was mostly used to debug code and might have been used by some members to help them create code or have a starting point to writing their parts of the code. That's about it though.
AI was definitely brought up and considered in our project, but since it is more of a proof of concept/experimental project, we didn't want to commit too many resources to learning how to effectively set up and use AI this time around. Maybe in the future though.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for the core pattern recognition work.

User: It pretty much boiled down to a resource problem. We didn't want to invest much money or time for people to learn how to use it for this specific scenario and to keep the model operational. Once again this was kind of a dipping our toes in project, before we decide whether or not to more fully commit to this type of work or not.

AI: That makes sense - resource allocation is such a practical consideration, especially for exploratory work.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - beyond the resource constraints you mentioned, what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Personally I don't love using it that much since I worry about it's accuracy in my work. You can't really see its reasoning process or thoughts about some aspects and so if I use it to make decisions on subjects I know a lot about, I think it can only do worse than me if I take my time and think it through.
Or for pattern recognition for example I'm sure it can do way better than me, but who's to say the patterns it recognizes are relevant ones or not. 
Overall my main concern is correctness and quality of work.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective on the visibility and interpretability challenges. 

When you have used AI for debugging code - which you mentioned earlier - how do you verify or validate what it produces in those situations?

User: Mostly by testing it. We try to always write modular style code, so we can test small parts together pretty easily. So we just give it a few examples trying to come up with all the edge cases we can think of and see if the code correctly handles that or not. If it does and we review it and can't find any logic errors or have any other concerns with it we will generally slightly modify it for efficiency and use it.
Other times when we see the approach it took, it inspires us and we think of a new and better way to do it. So it is sometimes used almost as a brainstorming tool for inspiration.

AI: That's interesting how AI can serve both as a practical debugging tool and as inspiration for new approaches. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Being able to correctly tell me about any concept in my field when I ask it to. It would be very helpful to have an accurate repository of information for any simple definitions/concepts that I can query with an AI. This would save so much time so that I don't have to browse the web or research papers to remind myself (if I already know it) or learn about (if I don't).

AI: That would be incredibly valuable - having that reliable, accurate knowledge base at your fingertips. The time savings alone would be substantial.

Those are all my questions, but before we wrap up - your perspectives on balancing AI's potential benefits against concerns about accuracy and interpretability were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Nothing that I can think of at the moment.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between AI's potential time-saving benefits and the critical need for accuracy and interpretability in scientific work really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real research environments. The practical considerations around resource allocation for exploratory projects were also very illuminating.

User: This sounds good, what level of detail do you prefer for the responses?

AI: Great question! I'd love to hear as much detail as you're comfortable sharing. The more specific you can be about your actual experiences - the better. Think of concrete examples, specific moments, or particular projects when you can.

For instance, instead of ""I sometimes use AI for data analysis,"" I'd be curious to hear something like ""Last month when I was working on analyzing gene expression data, I tried using AI to identify patterns, and here's what happened...""

The goal is really to understand your real-world experience, so whatever level of detail feels natural to you as you're telling me about your work is perfect. Don't worry about being too verbose - I'm here to listen and learn from you.

Ready to dive in?

User: all right

AI: Perfect! Let's get started.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: recently I worked in a multidisciplinary team for the design and engineering of microbial strains with the goal of obtain a single strain capable to use multiple feedstocks to produce a chemical. I participated mostly in the computational design of the strain and to evaluate two potential host organisms for their feasibility as base framework for the construction of inducible genetic circuits. The research process comprised a major literature review to collect information about multiple feedstocks, theirs pathways, kinetic data, regulation and then integrate that information for the construction of genome scale models of the host organisms with the required reaction and pathways for assimilating the feedstock and to produce the target chemical. Then we estimated different parameters such as theoretical yield, yield under different conditions, energy and oxygen requirements and finally we used the estimated data to populate a techno-economical model for the evaluation of the process at industrial scale so we can evaluate the feasibility of the strategy at industrial level before to commit with the construction of the strain.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive computational workflow - from literature review all the way through to techno-economic modeling. That's quite a journey from initial concept to industrial feasibility assessment.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Yes, we experimented with AI tools during the literature review , data extraction from websites, databases or papers, developing and organizing code for the computational analysis, fixing bug and verify calculations, to get information for the techno-economical model and in helping writing the technical report. I must say that this was some months ago, so the models we tested were not very helpful most of the time, but now I have seen improvements with the newer models.

AI: That's fascinating that you tried AI across so many different stages - from literature review all the way to report writing. You mentioned that the models weren't very helpful at the time but you've noticed improvements since then.

For one of those specific tasks you mentioned - let's say the literature review or data extraction - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach.

User: I decided to try AI because of the promise of speed up trivial or time consuming tasks such as scrapping websites looking for information to populate spreadsheets or extracting specific information such as metabolites, kinetic data, growth conditions from papers that it would take me much more time to read and analyze by my self.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - targeting those time-intensive tasks where you're looking for specific pieces of information. 

Tell me more about what happened when you actually tried using AI for those tasks. How did it go in practice compared to what you were hoping for?

User: I noticed that a simple prompt is not enough and the model had the trend to hallucinate, so it was detrimental for our process since we had to double check all the already extracted data. Even with simple tasks such as reading a website and get specific piece of information the model hallucinated. Since we where working in a team, most of the team members used simple prompts and the results were inconsistent. I prefer to take the task over all by my self and use advance prompting strategies such as provide the preprocessed text of the website and use a much more detailed prompt with specific instructions to avoid hallucinations. This was how I managed to make it work.

AI: That's a really insightful experience - it sounds like there was a real learning curve around prompting strategy, and that the team had different approaches that led to inconsistent results. When you say you used ""advanced prompting strategies"" and ""specific instructions to avoid hallucinations,"" what did that look like in practice?

Can you give me an example of how you changed your approach to make it work better?

User: Sure, The simple or basic prompt that most of the team users used were giving a website link such as ""[REDACTED]"" and then ask to collect information to populate a spreadsheet that look like this:
id name metabolites stoichiometry gpr reversibility subsystem ec_number bigg_reaction kegg_pathway kegg_reaction_id metanetx_reaction_id pubmed rhea seed_reaction

Then some provided instructions such as do not hallucinate etc but still the results were inconsistent.
What I implemented was to preprocess the actual webpage content and provide it in the prompt, then I explained the spreadsheet format and provided examples of a couple of rows. I also added specific instructions about how to handle missing data such as to fill with NA instead of hallucinate or guess.

With this method I was able to get much more consistent and accurate data extracted from websites and papers.

AI: That's a really clear example of how much the approach matters. It sounds like preprocessing the content and providing specific examples made a huge difference compared to just giving the AI a URL and hoping for the best.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like maybe the genome scale modeling or the theoretical yield calculations - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Actually i tried it briefly, but I noticed that it struggled with the domain-specific scientific libraries that we used, the model had a general idea about the process but lack of a deep understanding of the processes requires to complete the pipeline by itself. Instead, it worked as an assistant in code debugging and code reorganization. I think that in other areas where novelty is required such as the generation of hypothesis or initial ideas for new projects, I haven't really used them because I don't trust enough its capacity for generating truly novel ideas and not just iterations or combination of others ideas.  Also, back in the day of this project the reasoning capabilities of the model weren't great.

AI: That's really interesting - so it sounds like for the more specialized technical work, the AI lacked the deep domain knowledge to handle the full pipeline, but it was useful as a coding assistant. And for the creative, hypothesis-generating work, it's more about trust in whether it can produce truly novel insights.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: when you have used AI for tasks like data extraction or code debugging, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I usually run the code and use common or simple examples

AI: So you test it against cases where you already know what the expected outcome should be. That makes sense for code validation.

What about for the data extraction tasks - how do you check that the information it pulled from papers or websites is accurate?

User: I do sampling and verify most of the data doing a quick search, but still is easier than filling the complete spreadsheet by my self

AI: That's a practical approach - spot checking a sample rather than having to manually extract everything yourself. It sounds like even with the verification step, you're still coming out ahead time-wise.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: discovery relevant papers or literature for my projects. Mostly, because is a time-intensive task that have high relevance to my work since I can consider new approaches or avoid duplicated work.

AI: That's a really compelling use case - literature discovery seems like it would have such a high impact on the direction and quality of your research. It sounds like current approaches for finding relevant papers aren't quite meeting your needs.

What would make an AI tool truly useful for literature discovery in your field? What would it need to do differently than what's available now?

User: It requires specific tools mostly have a paywall and is not a guarantee that they work, standard models such as LLMs are not good for literature review because they trend to hallucinate.

AI: That brings up an interesting point about access and reliability. You've mentioned hallucination as a recurring challenge throughout our conversation - from data extraction to literature review.

Those are all my questions. Your perspectives on the importance of advanced prompting strategies and the ongoing challenge of AI hallucination in scientific work were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Yes, we require specific models trained for academic language. I have noticed that some tools use a more literacy style instead of standard academic language.

AI: That's a really valuable point - the distinction between literary style and academic language could be quite important for scientific work. It sounds like the training data or fine-tuning of current models might not be well-matched to the formal, precise language requirements of academic research.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the need for domain-specific training, the critical importance of prompting strategies, and the challenges with hallucination in scientific contexts really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real research work. The specific examples you gave - from your team's different approaches to data extraction to your sampling verification methods - paint a clear picture of both the potential and the current limitations.

science_0005,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I'm going to be somewhat vague here to protect my identity and my IP, but the overall goal of the project was post-processing of nanomaterial composites by dopant intercalation. The initial idea was driving material properties past the current state-of-the-art and ended with a mutivariable parameter space study of the experimental process to identify optimal processing conditions.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - working with nanomaterials and optimizing those processing conditions must involve quite a complex workflow.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: So my project spanned several years and only recently did I start integrating AI tools into my work. I did not use AI for DOE (design of experiments) or the literature review (although both would probably been quite useful). For the most part, I used AI to assist with coding: to provide example code snippets and to discuss alternative coding solutions to my data analysis. I also never gave an AI model my raw data and asked for analysis; rather, I proposed a generic coding problem and used AI to help me develop the code to solve my proposed problem (somewhat abstracting my own work out of the process).

AI: That's really interesting - you've been quite thoughtful about how you engage with AI, especially keeping your actual data separate from the process. 

For the coding assistance you mentioned, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach when you ran into those programming challenges.

User: Well my traditional approach was to Google my coding question and spend hours pouring through forum discussions and codebase documentation in order to figure out how to implement my coding needs. I figured it would be much smarter and more efficient to converse with a language model trained on this wealth of information; someone that had already aggregated and analyzed the various coding discussions throughout the web and could provide a quick recommendation from that experience.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you saw AI as a more efficient way to access that same pool of knowledge you were already tapping into.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your research - like the DOE, literature review, or direct data analysis that you mentioned - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: DOE and literature review - this was primarily because these components of the project were already complete by the time I started experimenting with AI tools. I could always go back and expand the background review at this point, but the project is mostly complete. Perhaps I will do so just to make sure I haven't missed any important citations. For direct data analysis, I think my job as a researcher is to be able to draw meaningful conclusions from my datasets. If I rely too heavily on someone else's thoughts on my data, I run the risk of failing to properly understand it myself. Having said that, I think AI is very useful for helping me write the tools to process my data, I just think the critical thinking should be done solely by me (or my coauthors).

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI to build the tools but keeping the critical thinking and interpretation in your own hands.

When you've used AI for that coding assistance, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the code suggestions actually work for your needs?

User: Well generally my code doesn't make high-level decisions on my behalf. It does very low level things: plotting, smoothing, averaging, baselining, integrating, etc. Occasionally I will use image analysis or other computer vision techniques. A lot of the setup to make a useful plot in, say, python is busywork. If I can have AI figure out how to handle the pandas dataframe for my dataset and organize it in a useful way, then I can spend more of my time analyzing the relationship between the data rather than wrestling with it to display it in a way that makes sense. I don't ever ask AI to write an entire codebase for me. It's usually a very specific request, like, how can I automate the plotting of data from this dataframe with line color determined by this column property and marker color determined by this column, etc. The majority of code is still written by me, with some sticking points eased-up by AI tools.

AI: That's a really clear picture of how you're using AI as more of a targeted assistant for specific technical hurdles rather than a wholesale solution. It sounds like you maintain a lot of control over the overall process.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: If I could wave a magic want and make AI finish my manuscript for me, then I would do that haha. I know AI *can* do this, so the magic wand would serve more to remove the ethical considerations for such a task. So the why is: because manuscript writing is hard and I don't enjoy it but also having an AI tool handle the actual scientific communication is ethically unacceptable.

AI: That's such an honest answer - and it really highlights the tension between what AI could potentially do versus what feels appropriate to use it for in scientific work.

We're near the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions, and your perspectives on maintaining that boundary between using AI as a tool versus having it do the actual scientific thinking have been particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I should say that I don't mean to downplay the capabilities of AI with my comments, but I think clear distinctions need to be made between using AI as a tool or resource and having AI replace all aspects of scientific research. Of course, it would be nice if AI *could* perform PhD-level analysis, and I'm sure it will some day, but if scientists are not proactive in responsible use of AI now, then no one will have the scientific literacy or experience to tell *if* an ""AI scientist"" is reasonable or accurate in its statements.

AI: That's a really profound point - you're highlighting this critical balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining the human expertise needed to evaluate and guide scientific work. The idea that we need to preserve scientific literacy to be able to assess AI's contributions is particularly compelling.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about using AI as a targeted tool while maintaining ownership of the critical thinking and interpretation really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you made between efficiency gains versus ethical boundaries in scientific communication was especially valuable.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: Thanks for the engaging conversation!

AI: You're very welcome! I really enjoyed our conversation too - your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into your research while maintaining those important ethical boundaries was fascinating to hear about. Thank you again for sharing your insights so openly. Take care!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I'm investigating the CO2 uptake of adsorbents using a breakthrough analyser to screen for suitable adsorbents

AI: That sounds fascinating - CO2 capture is such an important area of research right now. 

Tell me more about that process. When you say you're using a breakthrough analyzer to screen adsorbents, what does a typical project look like from when you first identify a potential adsorbent to when you have your results?

User: Our computation team gives us some screened materials they believe will be promising, then our experimental team synthesises the compounds. I then make the method for the gas adsorption measurements. This involves reading research papers to see what others have done in terms of activation or regeneration for the same or similar samples. I work on method refinement and data analysis to get a good repeatable method that gives us data we can be confident in.

AI: That's a really clear workflow - from computational screening to synthesis to your experimental validation work. It sounds like you're at the crucial bridge between theory and practice.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm thinking about any part of it - the literature review, method development, data analysis, or other aspects.

User: I've used AI to summarize notes I've made during the literature review phase

AI: Tell me more about that. When you're doing literature review and making notes, how do you decide to bring AI into that process versus handling it with your traditional approach?

User: I only use the AI when it's not going to be publishable work, i.e. I'm writing a method, make a list of steps and then ask the AI to clean it up. So for personal use only.

AI: That's interesting - you're making a clear distinction between what you'll use AI for versus not. What's behind that boundary for you? What makes you comfortable using it for personal method notes but not for publishable work?

User: For personal work, I know very easily if there has been a mistake through the AI process. With literature review, as I'm not always familiar, I may not notice any errors, so I would have to fact check anyway which means I might as well do the majority of it myself to start with.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially relying on your own expertise as a quality check. So for the method writing where you know the domain well, you can easily spot if the AI gets something wrong, but for literature review in unfamiliar territory, that safety net isn't there.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the data analysis from your breakthrough analyzer or the method refinement process - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I'm not convinced that AI can be a substitute for experience. For example, data might look odd - a non specialist like an AI model may think there is erroneous data, or assume a cause that is generic albeit sensible. When I look at data I have years of experience behind me looking at strange data sets, so I can make inferences on data quality and what it means for very specific cases, or generalise from other instances to apply to the current data set. So much of science is unpublished (especially when experiments don't go correctly!) so I would not rely on an AI model which has been trained with published data alone.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the gap between published results and the reality of experimental work. You're saying that so much of your expertise comes from seeing things go wrong and understanding what that means - the kind of knowledge that doesn't make it into papers.

When you've used AI for that method writing and note summarization, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What does that checking process look like for you?

User: As I only ask for brief points in non-esoteric language, a quick skim will do the job.

AI: That sounds efficient - keeping it to straightforward, accessible language where errors would stand out quickly.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Compiling data sets from multiple papers into complex tables which accurately include different variables and unit conversions to maintain a consistent format

AI: That's such a specific and practical need - it sounds like you're envisioning AI handling the tedious but critical work of standardizing data across different research groups' reporting styles and units.

What makes that task particularly challenging when you do it manually? Is it the volume of papers, the inconsistency in how people report their results, or something else?

User: It's the volume and inconsistency - there would also be a fantastic angle if AI could tabulate graphs directly. There are some web tools which help but it's tedious (clicking the exact points etc). It's not common practice yet to provide tabulated data for all published graphs, if I could drop a graph PNG into a model and the AI returned a table of the data my life would be so much easier!

AI: That sounds like it would be a game-changer for your work! Being able to extract data directly from published graphs would save enormous amounts of time.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using your domain expertise as a quality filter and the gap between published versus real experimental knowledge were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think that's a good summary - the gap between what is published and what is known by 'word of mouth' is enormous. No one publishes detailed troubleshooting steps (even instrument manuals themselves don't go into painstaking detail).

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that knowledge gap - the enormous difference between published results and the troubleshooting wisdom that gets passed along informally - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. That distinction between where your expertise can catch AI errors versus where it can't is something we'll definitely be thinking about.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good Im ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent project was developing a CubeSat a small satellite for detecting space debris in low earth orbit. I joined the project half way through the development of the satellite so it was a lot of initial familiarising myself with the project reading lots of papers on the current design and reviewing technical details of the satellite. After the initial familiarising our team worked on advancing the design further with my technical area being the On-Board Data Handling (OBDH) system. This involved researching extensively into how OBDH systems functioned, what components are necessary, how data is managed and proceed etc. Then going on to create a physical and functional architectures for the OBDH system outlining the components, how they functioned and interacted with the rest of the satellite. This culminated a joint paper being produced (300+ pages) by my team on the improved design of the satellite

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive project - from joining mid-development to contributing to a 300+ page technical paper. The progression from initial familiarization through research and design to final documentation gives me a good sense of your workflow.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: A lot of my AI use during the project was for doing research. I found it very useful to ask ChatGPT deep research to find me papers, for example on OBDH design in CubeSats and it would return a lot of useful resources and summaries of the papers that it found. I would then review the papers myself and take the information I needed as the summaries weren't always accurate. I also used it a lot of parsing documents so I would upload a pdf into the AI agent and ask it to find specific information and tell me what page it is on. This saved a lot of time as it saved me from reading through pages of documents to find one specific technical detail that I wanted

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you found AI particularly valuable for those initial research and information-gathering phases. The document parsing capability especially seems like it saved you significant time.

For the research assistance you mentioned - finding papers and getting summaries - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those tasks.

User: Traditional methods require a lot of time and resources to look through a bunch of papers and then find papers that are relevant. Using this method there can be a lot of wasted time looking at irrelevant or unhelpful resources. VS with AI it does the looking for you can mostly returns relevant articles and papers so it saves a lot of time that would be wasted using traditional methods

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the efficiency gain from having AI pre-filter and surface relevant papers rather than manually sifting through potentially irrelevant ones sounds significant.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like developing the physical and functional architectures or the technical design work - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I think AI hasn't gotten to the point where it can create accurate detailed technical drawings and designs yet. I have tried asking AI to produced technical outputs but the response are either inaccurate or cannot produce the desired output to a good enough level of detail

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI seems effective for information processing and research tasks but not yet capable of producing the technical precision your design work requires.

When you've used AI for research assistance and document parsing, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: Any source the AI gives me I check over myself to verify the contents of it and if the source is actually relevant. For document parsing i always ask it to give me the page number and where it found information so I can look at it myself

AI: That verification approach sounds really practical - essentially using AI as a first-pass filter while maintaining your own oversight. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would probably say making technical drawings would be amazing as it would save a lot of time using CAD software's to create the designs

AI: That would be a significant time-saver - being able to generate technical CAD drawings directly rather than having to manually create them in specialized software. The precision requirements you mentioned earlier make sense for why that's not feasible yet but would be so valuable if it worked reliably.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as an efficient research filter while maintaining verification practices, and the clear boundaries you've identified between where AI helps versus where technical precision is still needed, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No I think that is it

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI serves as an effective research assistant while still requiring human verification, and the clear distinction between information processing tasks versus technical design work, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's particularly valuable to hear how you've found that sweet spot of using AI to save time on research and document parsing while recognizing its current limitations for precision technical outputs. Your approach of always asking for page numbers and sources shows a really thoughtful way of leveraging AI's strengths while maintaining scientific rigor.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, no questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I work in medical research, specifically clinical trials.  The ""initial idea"" for a given medicine has already taken place some time before it passes on to the team I work in. We take over an eligible medication as it moves on to phase 2. For a recent compound, we designed a dose finding trial and  crossover trial for evidence of efficacy with a built in futility analysis. Parts of the team find partner sites for the trials, other parts determine how many patients are needed to give a reasonable chance of detecting efficacy if it is present, another part of the team deals with randomisation and blinding, another part of the team with data control and so on.

AI: That's really helpful context - thank you. It sounds like there are many distinct phases and team roles involved in moving a compound through phase 2 trials.

Thinking about all those different components you mentioned - from dose finding design to partner site selection, statistical planning, randomization, data control - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Primarily with literature searches to look for existing clinical trials related to the mechanism, similar compounds or similar study designs in order to help the statisticians refine their calculations to minimise the number of patients needed to answer a given question. This helps reduce clinical risk and cost. Other potential uses of AI don't appear to have been adopted at this time. I am unclear if this relates to capability or the need for blinding etc.

AI: That's interesting - using AI for literature searches to inform statistical calculations makes a lot of sense for optimizing trial design.

For those literature searches specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding relevant trials and information.

User: Essentially we do both. Our company has access to online databases to look for studies and we search through those with traditional search queries as we always have, but we additionally interrogate AI to look for any studies we may have missed or which could be related in unusual ways.

AI: That's a great approach - using both methods as a safety net. When you interrogate AI to look for studies you might have missed or unusual connections, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: We go and look at the studies the AI found. The AI is used to provide suggestions.

AI: That makes complete sense - treating AI as a suggestion generator rather than a definitive source.

Thinking about the other parts of your research workflow that you mentioned - the dose finding design, partner site selection, randomization procedures, data control - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: It is a combination of things. Patient confidentiality when it comes to data control and QC (probably the area that AI could do the most for). For statistical analysis and coding there is a requirement for 2 individuals to independently generate the work then check if they agree. I know one person uses AI to check their code if they run into an error they aren't sure of, but they are required to supply a human generated output. Trial design will probably always be human driven because of the implied risks in clinical trials. I think, probably, most of the issue lies with confidentiality, blinding and the intensely risk averse nature of drug development. It would probably require a bespoke tool with appropriate hard coded blinding and data safety to start using AI for the most AI applicable tasks.

AI: That's a really insightful breakdown of the different barriers at play - confidentiality requirements, regulatory validation needs, and the risk-averse nature of the field. The point about needing bespoke tools with built-in safeguards is particularly interesting.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Data control and validation. The nature of drug development is a slow burn of preparatory work and ongoing validation whilst you get people through the trials followed by an intense flurry of work once the database is locked and unblinding occurs with every delay being a massive issue since it is the portion of development we can control and the clock is always ticking on patents. Data management have large volumes of repetitive data to validate and things can be missed which causes significant delay. AI seems to me well suited to validating reems of data if given appropriate instructions. Or at least with a different likely error set to human review, so increasing the likelihood of something being flagged and dealt with. There is also the possibility of picking up fabricated data earlier, since AI can potentially spot suspicious patterns of numbers earlier, something that often doesn't occur until the statisticians get hold of the data late on.

AI: That's a compelling use case - the combination of volume, time pressure, and the need for pattern recognition in data validation does seem like a natural fit for AI capabilities. And the idea of AI having a different error profile than humans to catch things that might slip through is really thoughtful.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the regulatory constraints and the potential for AI in data validation were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, for the portion of drug development I am involved in, that seems like it covers most applicable aspects. Someone in drug discovery or some of the other groups that liase with us such as manufacturing or pharmacokinetics would have different perspectives. So I just want you to be aware this is limited to a phase 2 clinical trial team perspective, not drug development as a whole.

AI: That's a really important distinction to make - thank you for clarifying the scope of your perspective. It's valuable to understand how AI integration varies across different stages of drug development.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between AI's potential in data validation and the regulatory/confidentiality barriers really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into highly regulated scientific work. The point about needing bespoke tools with built-in safeguards was particularly valuable for understanding the path forward.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. No I don't have any questions yet.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I have been working in analytical chemistry. The latest project I worked on was developing a method to separate a starting material from a product, in order to assess the percent purity of the product to qualify it for use in other analytical methods/development. What it looked like was acquiring relevant chemicals from the process department, then using UPLC with conditions taken directly from a related method. I noticed issues with one of the compounds eluting in the solvent front, which I corrected by changing the column. I also changed the flow rate, and did a PDA screen for ideal wavelength, which ended up being very different from the initial method. I also found a new Mobile Phase based on my screening process, which included a change of acid to prevent an unwanted acid/base equilibrium and solvent for better separation. Finally, I changed the method to make it shorter without sacrificing too much separation quality. This was then converted into a formal development report and is up for validation.

AI: That's a really detailed process - it sounds like there were quite a few optimization steps from the initial conditions to your final method. The troubleshooting with the solvent front issue and all the screening work for wavelength and mobile phase composition sounds pretty involved.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI mode on Google when deciding which column to use, asking it how to efficiently screen and to get the molecule out of the solvent front. Other than that, I didn't use AI tools.

AI: Interesting - so you used Google's AI mode specifically for the column selection and solvent front troubleshooting. 

Tell me more about how you decided to turn to AI for that particular problem versus using your traditional approach for the other optimization steps.

User: I was more confident in the other steps, and I was overwhelmed by the number of choices for column that were available to me. AI can be helpful to make a reasonable first pass guess to establish a starting point for screening, reducing mental load and choice paralysis. Everything else I felt like I knew what I was doing and I didn't need to ask.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a way to cut through the noise when you're facing too many options and need a reasonable starting point. It sounds like confidence in your own knowledge played a big role in when you chose to use it versus when you didn't.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the PDA screening, mobile phase optimization, or method development - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I likely would have turned to AI if my own solutions had failed, but because everything I did seemed to work/improve the separation, I had no need to seek out answers outside of my own initial thoughts/instinct.

AI: That's really insightful - so it sounds like AI becomes more appealing when your initial approaches hit a wall, but when your expertise is getting you the results you need, there's less motivation to bring in an external tool.

When you did use AI for the column selection, how did you verify or validate what it suggested to you?

User: I relied on my own instinct and expertise to judge if it was reasonable, I also asked a co-worker if my chosen screen made sense. Finally, I ran experiments, and the first column had dramatic improvements.

AI: That's a nice validation process - using your expertise as a first filter, getting a colleague's perspective, and then letting the experimental results speak for themselves. And it sounds like the AI suggestion worked out well with those dramatic improvements.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Honestly, it would be nice if AI would help me write the report. It is very robotic and regulated, and seems like a prime candidate to be handled by an unfeeling machine rather than a human being who is prone to errors and occasional quirky phrasing that might not be received well.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - the idea that the highly regulated, standardized nature of analytical reports actually makes them a good fit for AI, rather than the more creative or exploratory parts of research. And you're pointing out that human quirks in writing might actually be a liability in that context rather than an asset.

Tell me more about what makes report writing particularly challenging or tedious for you in your current process.

User: It is the combination of being highly regulated and fully manually entered. I think that it is naturally difficult for human beings to follow rules down to the letter without making any small mistakes, and that is what this particular assignment expects.

AI: That combination of needing perfect adherence to detailed regulations while doing it all manually does sound like it plays against human strengths. It's interesting how you're identifying a mismatch between what humans naturally excel at versus what the task demands.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI strategically when you hit knowledge gaps or choice paralysis, but relying on your expertise when it's working, was particularly insightful. And your point about regulated writing being better suited for AI than humans really highlights how different types of work might benefit from AI in unexpected ways.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Well, I'm sure you know, but the ethical use of AI is highly uncertain and guidance is slim to none. Many ChatBots are banned on the network, but not AI mode, because it is tied directly to Google, and they can't block Google.

AI: That's a really important point - the disconnect between institutional policies and practical reality. It sounds like you're navigating a landscape where the rules haven't caught up with the available tools, and that creates some ambiguity about what's actually acceptable to use.

How does that uncertainty around ethical use and guidelines affect your decisions about when or how to use AI in your work?

User: I would use it more if it was encouraged or explicitly allowed. But as is, I can't really tell my boss that I used AI for a report, so I just won't do it to avoid getting in trouble. I only feel comfortable using it like Google and without including any confidential information, of course.

AI: That really captures the tension you're working in - having access to tools that could potentially help with tasks like report writing, but the institutional uncertainty creating a chilling effect where you stick to safer, more Google-like uses to avoid any potential issues.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for decision support when facing choice paralysis, versus relying on your own expertise when it's working well, really help us understand the nuanced way scientists think about integrating these tools. And your point about the mismatch between institutional policies and practical tool availability highlights an important challenge many researchers are likely facing.

science_0010,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions at the moment, please continue.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Recently I commissioned a 150MW BESS and substation project. In addition to the electrical design in AutoCAD, I created an insulation coordination study for surge arresters and harmonics study for inverters from first principles. The final output of the project was an active substation and BESS.

AI: That sounds like a substantial project with a lot of technical complexity. So you went from the initial design work in AutoCAD through those specialized studies - the insulation coordination and harmonics analysis - all the way to commissioning the actual facility.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI in a few places. Here is a list of things I recall:
1. AutoCAD error fixes. I had an unusual error in AutoCAD MEP where my command line was not working and none of my schematics symbols - which are MEP objects - were showing.

AI: That's really interesting - you used AI for troubleshooting that specific AutoCAD MEP issue. Tell me more about that. How did you decide to turn to AI for that particular problem rather than using your usual approach when you hit technical issues?

User: Excuse me, I pressed enter instead of Alt+Enter. The list continued:
1. I used it to learn more about how different surge arresters could be used and the roles TOV and MCOV play in surge arrester selection.
2. Harmonics study: I asked about triplen harmonics, differences in inverters, and whether current or voltage magnitude harmonics are useful to utilities.

AI: Thanks for the full list! So you used AI for the AutoCAD troubleshooting, learning about surge arrester specifications, and getting clarity on harmonics analysis concepts.

Let's dig into one of these - for the surge arrester selection where you were learning about TOV and MCOV, how did you decide to use AI versus your traditional approach for getting that technical information?

User: The IEEE code I was using was C62.11-1999 - if I remember correctly. This code has some graphs in Annex B that can be used in conjunction with impedance ratios from ETAP. However, before I knew what code to find this in, I asked AI to help me find these curves. It was a quick search tool in IEEE libraries.

AI: That's a really practical use case - using AI as a search tool to help you navigate to the right IEEE standard before diving into the technical details. It sounds like it helped you locate C62.11-1999 and those Annex B curves more efficiently than you might have found them otherwise.

Thinking about the parts of your research and design work where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Specificity - although the upper hand that AI has over classical search tools like Google is the ability to customise responses based on exact user inputs and constraints, it sometimes word vomits and feels overwhelming to use. The second reason was to have a more in-depth understanding of a topic instead of jumping to an answer or output.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making. The word vomit issue is interesting - it sounds like sometimes AI gives you more than you need when you're looking for something specific.

And I'm curious about that second point - wanting deeper understanding rather than jumping to an answer. Can you tell me more about how that plays into your decision-making? Are there specific types of problems where you feel like working through it yourself is more valuable than getting an AI-generated response?

User: The thing with learning is that without struggle or alternative options being considered, it is difficult to retain information. AI usually gives the correct answer without alternative thought processes. This kills creativity and also makes it difficult to defend decisions made about research topics. For example, if I choose a Siemens surge arrester because an AI tool tells me to, I do not consider all possible options - ABB, Hubbell, Richards, etc. Perhaps I can ask an AI tool to compare common available ones for me but then one must consider what information they may be missing if they do not look at the datasheet themeselves.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the learning process. You're highlighting something important - that the struggle of working through alternatives yourself is actually valuable for both retention and being able to defend your technical decisions later.

When you have used AI for something like the harmonics study questions, how do you verify or validate what it produces? Do you have a process for checking that information before you rely on it?

User: I do check information - sometimes information is not available in AI tools such as specific values from datasheets which are only distributed under an NDA so that information cannot be used. However, sometimes if something ""seems"" right, and is in the ballpark of being correct then I might trust it. For example, if an AI tells me that 50kg is 120lbs, I would not question it too much.

AI: That makes sense - you have this intuitive calibration where if something falls within your expected range, you're more likely to trust it without extensive verification.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research or engineering work that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Probably formatting in AutoCAD. I feel like I waste a lot of time making things look pretty when it is something I could delegate to an AI.

AI: That's fascinating - so it's the presentation layer where you see the biggest opportunity. It sounds like you're spending valuable engineering time on formatting tasks that could potentially be automated.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on balancing AI efficiency with deep learning, and how you calibrate trust based on your technical intuition, was particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your engineering work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I would say Excel calculators. We have calculators for all sorts of things - battery calculations, load calculations, CT saturation, and load flow. If one could give relevant information and have an excel sheet filled out and updated, that would be useful.

AI: That's a really valuable addition - the idea of AI being able to populate and update those specialized Excel calculators based on project parameters you provide. It sounds like another area where AI could handle the routine data entry and formatting while you focus on the engineering judgment.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI efficiency and maintaining that deep technical understanding - especially your point about needing to consider all the Siemens, ABB, Hubbell alternatives yourself - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank yo

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you so much for your time and thoughtful responses. Your perspective as an electrical engineer working on these complex power systems projects has been incredibly valuable for our research. Take care!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions yet

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Recently I worked on a research project to determine whether or not different machine learning models could accurately predict the outcome of specific batter vs. hitter matchups in a baseball game. The first steps were to extract and clean the data, the following step was to build different types of models (SVM, LightGBM and CNN) that could potentially be a good fit for the output we want, tailor the dataset input to each type of model studied, and finally use statistical methods to determine which model provided the most accurate models.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project combining sports analytics with machine learning! I can picture that workflow - from data extraction and cleaning, through model building and tailoring, to statistical evaluation.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We used AI to help clean data and also to build a basic skeleton of each model as a guiding hand.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for the data cleaning - what did that look like in practice?

User: We inputted a lot of raw statistics for each player into the model and asked it to combine certain stats to output another statistic criteria we wanted to use. We also used it to remove players that didn't fit the criteria we were looking for, i.e. players who were rookies or over a certain age.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI helped you both derive new statistical measures from existing data and filter your dataset based on specific criteria. 

For those tasks - the data cleaning and creating that basic model skeleton - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach.

User: We used AI because we believed it to be a great starting point for code we were writing. It allows you to see an overview of all potentially required sections quicker, thus allowing you to see what is missing or needs improvement. Traditional approaches also work but would have been longer to iterate through many ideas.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a way to quickly iterate and see the bigger picture before diving into the details. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like maybe the statistical evaluation phase or other aspects - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: We found that AI was not able to draw the same in depth conclusions about the picture the statistics painted. It needed to be used in conjunction with a researcher.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - that AI couldn't capture the deeper analytical insights that a human researcher brings to interpreting the statistical results.

When you did use AI for the data cleaning and model skeleton, how did you verify or validate what it produced?

User: We would spot check the cleaned data to ensure it was not jargon. For the skeleton we used it as baseline, it needed adjustments to tailor it to what we needed.

AI: Got it - so you took a verification approach with spot-checking for the data work, and treated the model code more as a starting template that required your expertise to customize.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Here's my last question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: The critical analysis of the data and assistance in drawing proper conclusions based on stats. Currently it is not reliable enough to provide actual insights we can use.

AI: That's really valuable insight - you're pointing to what sounds like the most intellectually demanding part of the research process, where you need that deep analytical thinking to interpret what the statistics actually mean in context.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a starting point for iteration while recognizing its limitations in critical analysis were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI being most valuable as a rapid iteration tool for getting started, while still requiring human expertise for the critical analytical work, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific research.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent research project was a literature review and combined data analysis of research surrounding radioactive contamination in [REDACTED] aquifers. The idea started from a previous project of mine where I created a model predicting future contamination based on the addition of anthropogenic contaminants such as road salt. I wanted to study a specific area, find the trend of contamination over a decadal scale, and use the model to help determine future contamination. I also wanted to compare the model's results predictions to historical results to help further identify the accuracy of the model.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive project combining multiple approaches. Tell me more about what the actual process looked like once you had that initial idea - how did you move from concept to gathering data and analysis?

User: The first step was to identify which aquifer to focus on. There are many possible areas in the country that have the necessary geology to cause radioactive contamination if certain reactions take place in the aquifer. Then, I needed to determine where to source the data. There are a lot of data sets out there but the data I need require some more niche information. After that I needed to process some of the data, namely some of the more basic statistical analyses. Finally, I needed to find literature that was relevant to the topic.  The literature was used to compare and contrast my findings to that of prior research.

AI: Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Beyond the conceptualization of the research topic, I've experimented with AI tools throughout the different steps. Primarily, I have utilized AI to help me process data and identify other pieces of pertinent literature.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for processing data and identifying literature.

User: I decided to utilize AI to supplement the traditional approaches. The same steps and techniques were used but AI was used as a tool - helping me quickly process data so that I could identify trends then go in myself and process the data where I identified trends. It also helped me quickly identify materials, providing me with lists of surmised literature that I could then go and read, after I read through the surmised literature and determined what was pertinent to my work.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using it as a supplement rather than a replacement. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Several things are keeping me from using it throughout my work. The main factor is that I would like my research to be my own - my own ideas, analyses, and conclusions. Along that line of thinking, it's integral to the scientific process to follow certain steps and ensure that my research is all of my own work - often, utilizing AI for these portions of research creates ethical issues. Another reason that I do not utilize AI for certain things is because the AI itself does a poor job scouring literature, most of the time. It can identify stuff, but the synopses that it provides are often missing key details and misquoting information. It's not reliable or consistent.

AI: When you've used AI for data processing and literature identification, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I never take what AI produces and use it without verifying or validating. I consider AI to be the first step of many, I always go in and run any calculations and read any materials thoroughly myself. I never use anything that AI writes, everything it produces is considered but the work and research produced must be my own.

AI: We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would have AI help me with paring down and reading sources. It's something I have it do presently, but it does a very poor job of it. Identifying and reading literature is one of the more taxing parts of research. If AI could consistently identify papers that would be relevant to my research and take the most important parts, creating an accurate synopsis as it pertains to what I am looking for, that would be a game changer.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a supplement to maintain research integrity while still gaining efficiency benefits were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining ownership of your research while strategically using AI as a verification tool really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The tension you described between wanting efficiency gains and preserving research integrity is something I imagine many scientists grapple with.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yes and no

AI: Great, let's get started then.

To begin, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: I was researching what is included in a high school Precalculus class. I needed to write a curriculum map based on the client's format, and I wanted to make sure it covered everything required for CCSS standards as well as Pennsylvania's standards. I did a bunch of research on what topics are appropriate for a high school student, how those topics aligned with the standards, and what kinds of objectives could be used to measure student achievement in the course.

AI: That sounds like a really thorough curriculum development process. You mentioned researching topics, aligning with standards, and developing measurable objectives - that's quite a bit of ground to cover.

Where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: First, I asked it to come up with a table of contents without any kind of guidance. I used that as my ""rough draft."" I made a lot of changes, but it was helpful to have a starting point.
I used it to do a LOT of brainstorming. For example, I need one more lesson in this module. What are the pros and cons of splitting this lesson into 2 as opposed to adding a new lesson on a given topic. Or does it make sense to move this lesson to another module where it might fit better, and replace it with a lesson on this topic? Then we would discuss until I came up with a plan. 
I also asked it a lot of questions about standards. Are any missing, does this topic fit this standard, how can I incorporate this standard better into this lesson, etc.
Another thing AI was very helpful for was when I was writing practice problems. I had it give me some sample problems that I used as a starting point. AI is also extremely helpful for quickly getting solutions to complex problems, comparing problems to standards, increasing/decreasing difficulty, writing a problem that combines concepts from different standards, etc.

AI: It sounds like AI became a really integral brainstorming partner throughout your process - from that initial rough draft all the way through to fine-tuning individual practice problems. 

When you were making those decisions about whether to use AI versus doing something yourself - like when you needed to figure out whether to split a lesson or move it to another module - how did you decide whether to bring AI into that conversation or work through it on your own?

User: I usually start out by asking AI. If it gives a good answer, I will usually continue the conversation. But if it gives me wrong/bad information or doesn't understand the path I am trying to go down, I will revert to doing it myself.

AI: That's interesting - you've developed a kind of testing approach where you start with AI and then evaluate whether to continue based on the quality of its initial response.

Tell me more about how you recognize when AI is giving you wrong or bad information, especially in the context of curriculum development. What are the signs that make you think ""this isn't quite right""?

User: One thing it does a LOT is not remember previous parts of our conversation. If we decided to remove a lesson from a module and split another lesson into 2 parts to fill that gap, but then the AI is referencing the removed lesson, it is no longer efficient to take the time to remind the AI of what we decided.
Another time I had to give up on it was when I asked for sample problems, and it gave me problems that would not fulfill a certain objective correctly. It was easier for me to just write some of my own sample problems and move on from there.
Another thing is that sometimes the client has really strict guidelines that I must adhere to. But I have noticed if I give the AI too many guidelines, it has a hard time. For example, I might say, I can have 1-3 objectives for this lesson, they must all have only one verb, and they must all align with a practice problem. Sometimes it will give me 3 objectives all aligned to problems, but one will have 2 verbs. So I remind it that objectives can only have one verb, and ask it to try again. Instead of figuring out how to reword, like I would if given this task, it decides to split the offending objective into 2, so now I have 4 objectives, when i can only have 3.

AI: Those are really specific examples - it sounds like you've gotten quite good at recognizing AI's particular failure modes. The memory issue and the tendency to follow rules too literally rather than understanding the underlying constraints seem like they create real inefficiencies in your workflow.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your curriculum development process where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: I avoid using it for specific writing tasks, like actually writing the content of the lesson because I do not want to get in trouble with the client for plagiarism. But that is not the main reason. I am a writer, and I enjoy the writing process. I do not want to hand that over to AI when I think i can do a better job, and I am worried that if I hand over the reins, it will degrade my skill over time.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're balancing both professional concerns about plagiarism and personal values about maintaining your craft as a writer. The idea that using AI for writing might atrophy your skills over time is something I haven't heard articulated quite that way before.

When you have used AI for tasks like generating practice problems or brainstorming, how do you verify or validate what it produces before incorporating it into your curriculum?

User: I have a lot of education and experience in high school curriculum. I can pretty easily spot when there is something awry. But I usually run the end product through a different AI to verify that everything is accurate. But again, that is only after using my own expertise to validate what I'm given.

AI: So you're using your own expertise as the primary filter, and then bringing in a second AI almost as a secondary check - that's a really interesting validation approach.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your curriculum development work that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Write solutions to problems that  are CONSISTENT. In a textbook, I have to show the solution the exact same way every time a certain type of problem is used, in the lesson, in the review, in the test prep, in the additional practice problems, and on the assessment. But it seems like the AI usually ""starts fresh"" every time in its process and does not follow a consistent pattern for solving problems. For example, when finding the sine of an angle using the unit circle, figuring out the sign of the answer and finding the reference angle can be done in either order. But it needs to be done in the same order every time. I need consistency in process and formatting.

AI: That consistency requirement makes perfect sense for a curriculum - students need to see the same problem-solving approach reinforced across all materials. The fact that AI ""starts fresh"" each time and doesn't maintain that methodical consistency sounds like it creates a lot of extra work for you to standardize everything.

Those are all my questions. Your insights about using AI as a starting point for brainstorming but maintaining control over the actual writing, and especially your point about needing consistent problem-solving methods across materials, really highlight the nuanced ways AI fits into professional curriculum work.

Is there anything else about AI in your curriculum development work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so other than to say I don't think AI will ever replace a trained educator in creating curriculum. There are too many nuances that I think only a human will be able to parse through when creating excellent course material.

AI: Thank you so much for that insight - and for sharing your experiences so openly throughout our conversation. Your perspective on AI as a brainstorming partner while maintaining human expertise for the nuanced decision-making really helps us understand how professionals are thoughtfully integrating these tools into their specialized work.

Your point about consistency in problem-solving approaches was particularly illuminating - it's exactly the kind of domain-specific requirement that might not be obvious from the outside but is crucial for effective curriculum design.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, that sounds good and I am ready to begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently conducted a study predicting future direct operating costs for an all electric aircraft in commercial aviation. Since this was a purely conceptual research project, no experiments could be conducted, and extensive research was necessary. I created a cost model on Excel, using a number of assumptions and assessed the impact of varying these assumptions. Concluding my research by writing a complete paper about my findings.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - predicting costs for technology that's still emerging must have involved quite a bit of research and modeling work.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: AI assisted heavily in finding estimates for prices, such as engine prices, since it could scan a number of research papers for figures much faster than I could manually.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to scan through research papers for specific data points like engine prices sounds like it could save a lot of time.

For that literature scanning task, tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of manually searching through papers.

User: I would use AI for much of the original research, making sure to ask for sources for its information, then I would double check these sources to make sure that they were valid and correct. Additionally, if I had found a figure through traditional methods, occasionally I may ask AI to validate my own research.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI for the initial sweep and then verifying the sources yourself. It sounds like you've developed a system that combines the speed of AI with your own validation process.

Thinking about the other parts of your research - like building the Excel cost model or writing the final paper - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I used AI heavily when writing the paper, I would write each paragraph initially in semi-note form, then ask AI to rewrite this for a professional report. This saved a lot of time in the report writing process. I would then read the AI paragraph and rephrase where needed. For the Excel cost model, I found that AI did not create a very reliable model. The cost model I made was very clearly formatted and made changing variables simple and visible.

AI: So it sounds like you actually used AI quite extensively - for literature research, validating your findings, and drafting the paper. But when it came to the Excel modeling, you found AI wasn't reliable enough for that specific task.

When you've used AI for writing those paragraph drafts, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What do you look for when you're deciding whether to keep the AI's version or rephrase it?

User: I would almost always rephrase it, keeping only small combinations of words, AI was mostly used here to keep variety in the wording used.

AI: That's a really nuanced way of using AI - essentially as a writing assistant to help with variety and flow rather than relying on its content directly. It sounds like you've developed quite a sophisticated approach across different parts of your research process.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: To be honest, I enjoy the process of conducting the research myself, and wouldn't want AI to complete most of the tasks involved completely. If AI could work on producing accurate graphs from my data and formatting these to align with a paper, this would probably be the most helpful tool I can think of.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - you value the actual research process itself and want to maintain control over the core work, but you'd appreciate AI handling more of the technical formatting tasks like graph production.

This brings up something interesting about your overall experience. From what you've shared, it sounds like you've found a balance where AI supports your work without replacing your expertise or judgment. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so, at the moment I wouldn't trust AI to fully complete any tasks without needed to double check them.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about using AI as a research assistant while maintaining your own oversight and validation - rather than trusting it to complete tasks independently - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

Your approach of leveraging AI's speed for literature scanning and writing variety, while keeping the critical thinking and model building firmly in your own hands, shows a very thoughtful integration that preserves the integrity of your research process.

This has been incredibly valuable for our understanding of how scientists are navigating AI integration. Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! It was a pleasure speaking with you about your research. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"
science_0015,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No please go ahead and ask your first question.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am an undergraduate teacher of bioscience and recently, one of my undergraduate groups was designing criteria for a case study, based on a rare prion disease. Obviously, there are several recognised prion diseases and these cases are rare, so the purpose of the research was to find recent case studies on all prion diseases EXCLUDING Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, countries where the patients resided, which disease was being examined, whether the disease had a genetic origin (with a view to looking at potential familial connections for future case studies) and the age range of patients that had been recorded in these case studies. The students had to peruse case study research ONLY from the past decade and identify: the prion disease most likely to provide a wide pool of potential subjects, the country most likely to provide a suitable patient, the age range most likely to apply to this prion disease and if there was a genetic basis to any form of this disease. This was a three week project and the students were invited to use AI in their research (though not to assume that AI is correct and always check its claims). The students had very mixed results with the AI portion of their research. AI identified a lot of case studies that were either not case studies (instead they were research compilations that mentioned case studies, or wider scale reviews that mentioned several case studies). When asking simple questions such as 'what is the age range of known cases for Familial Fatal Insomnnia identified in the last 10 years', the AI assumed that there were no cases of young patients diagnosed with the disorder when the students' research had proven that cases of teenagers from known FFI families were both documented in review papers and in their own unique case studies. They were given good general points in the right direction in terms of countries to focus their studies on (Italy in FFI and PNG for Kuru) but when it came to specific papers and research (including number of citations on specific sites such as Google Scholar and PubMed) AI was way off and frequently hallucinated. So for general guidance, AI was useful but specifics were ordinarily proven incorrect.

AI: That's a fascinating project, and thank you for sharing those specific details about what worked and what didn't. It sounds like the AI was helpful for broad directional guidance but problematic when students needed precise, verifiable information.

Where in that research process did you and your students experiment with using AI tools beyond what you've already mentioned?

User: Several students used AI to find the best format to present their findings and actually found some good guidance here such as how to format a conference poster displaying criteria that would be easiest to fulfil when finding 'the next big case study', or letters to pharmaceutical companies requesting funding for such research (mentioning currently in-development prion treatments and how they might be relevant to the case studies being sought). My only guidance to them for this area of the research was 'Present it to the appropriate people with an appropriate purpose' so they had a lot of leeway here.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI was much more reliable for helping with presentation formats and communication strategies than with the specific research content itself.

For the literature review portion where AI struggled with accuracy, tell me about how you and your students decided whether to use AI versus your traditional research approach for finding those case studies.

User: The students were asked to use a trusted, established research engine such as PubMed or Scholar to check claims, or where possible to ask the AI for links to the appropriate articles (which would ordinarily allow PubMed login to read the paper, which they all have). Several students simply used what the AI told them, verbatim, and it showed as they had completely different results to other groups and were quoting details that were inaccurate. The students that approached this the way I would have done, used the AI for initial general direction and then used this to craft search terms for the major databases, which provided articles that filled in the 'blanks' of AI. Ordinarily, we would start from the broadest possible search terms (simply 'Kuru, past 10 years' or 'prions, past 10 years', which give countless results that are not easy to traverse. The students found AI useful to 'whittle down' this initial conventional step.

AI: That's really illuminating - so the students who were most successful treated AI as a kind of initial filter to help narrow down their search strategy rather than as a source of final answers.

Thinking about the parts of this research process where you haven't encouraged AI use - what's kept you from suggesting it for those areas?

User: I told the students to never trust a specific article or finding that is mentioned by AI - ALWAYS to confirm this themselves. As I say, the students who didn't bother to take this step were obvious as they a) were not writing in a literal, scientific way (cutting out all flowery language and descriptors which AI tends to include and b) were claiming research papers that were not case studies and findings from these case studies that were not accurately portrayed. This is why I told the students not to take this pathway. It would be excellent if AI could be trusted as a research scouring tool, but it cannot at this stage

AI: That makes perfect sense - the reliability issue with specific citations and findings is clearly a major barrier. It sounds like verification became a critical step that determined success or failure for your students.

When your students did use AI for those broader directional searches or presentation formats, how did you guide them to verify or validate what it produced in those areas?

User: They are all aware of how to research scientific literature (only use wikipedia for the links at the bottom, only use articles from publications that employ peer review etc) so they were told to always fall back on traditional databases (PubMed above all else) to confirm any specifics mentioned in the AI. AI's strength was in quoting past research that was over 10 years ago and is still being cited today. It is not particularly accurate in quoting recent research or knowing the difference between reviews and case studies etc.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - AI seems stronger with well-established, older research that's been widely cited. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research or teaching that it currently doesn't do well, what would that be and why?

User: It would have a comprehensive database of scientific literature available to it. Whilst I understand that the AI cannot be expected to be updated daily with this material, with a connection to PubMed it would certainly be possible to be able to accurately cite research from up to a year ago. I gave the students a broad period of ten years (and compared to other topics such as cancer, prion case studies are extremely rare) and still the AI was quoting inappropriate studies and giving incorrect dates for their publication/inaccurate lead scientists.

AI: That makes complete sense - having real-time or at least more current access to scientific databases would solve the core reliability issues you encountered. It sounds like that gap between AI's training data and current literature is a fundamental limitation for scientific research applications.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI works best as an initial research filter rather than a final source, and the critical importance of verification in scientific contexts, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research or teaching work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think the most important think to understand is the limitation of AI presently; although once these limitations are addressed, it would be important to engage science professionals (including students and teachers) to test whether the changes have been made sufficiently. It takes a lot of confidence, particularly in an area such as medicine, to say to students 'you can trust what this AI is saying' so it is likely that there will be considerable pushback until a model has proved itself flawless in this area!

AI: That's such an important point - the stakes are so high in medical and scientific contexts that the bar for trust has to be essentially perfect, and it will take time and extensive validation even after improvements are made.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI's current role as a research filter rather than a definitive source, and especially your point about the need for flawless performance before gaining trust in high-stakes fields like medicine, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I really appreciate the time you took to walk me through such specific examples from your classroom experience."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions at this time.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The most recent project I worked on was developing a FEMAP API for combining the individual von Mises results of Static and Random Response Analysis performed on an FEA model.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating technical project. Can you walk me through what that development process actually looked like day-to-day? I'm curious about how you went from the initial idea of combining those analysis results to having a working API.

User: To begin with, I had to conduct research on the topic to figure out the appropriate way to combine the results. I found a few peer-reviewed journals, articles, and forum posts related to the topic. After determining what method would provide the most accurate results, I then picked a couple of different elements to perform the combination by using excel as a reference. From there, I read the FEMAP API guide, watched youtube videos, and found some free resources provided by FEMAP experts to figure out how to construct my code to extract the FEA results needed for the combination calculations. Once I got the code to produce the same results for the elements' data I combined in excel, the API was deemed ready for use.

AI: That's really helpful - I can see you had quite a thorough process there, from research through validation. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: For this particular project, I used AI to assist with creating the code for extracting the combined data to an Excel spreadsheet.

AI: Tell me more about that. How did you decide to use AI for that specific part - the code for extracting the combined data to Excel - versus handling it with your traditional approach?

User: I chose to output the data to excel, because I wanted a cleaner and more organized way to present the results. Choosing AI to help with this seemed like a great idea after I realized how labor intensive it was to read through the guides to figure out what commands to use.

AI: I see - so the labor intensity of reading through the guides was what pushed you toward AI. How did that experience actually work out for you? What was it like using AI to help with that Excel output code versus working through those guides yourself?

User: It definitely cut down on the time it would've taken me to develop the code if I did not use it. It created a skeleton that I just had to verify and modify, rather than building from scratch.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - getting a skeleton to verify and modify rather than building from scratch. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the journal research, the methodology selection, reading the FEMAP API guide, even the validation work - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I'm used to using traditional methods to solve these types of problems (e.g. reading books, searching the internet, watching videos). I had a lack of understanding and low level of trust for AI during the time. Additionally, the workplace had rules on the use of AI that I did not fully understand, which caused some additional hesitation. There has been a shift since, that allows more freedom to use such tools.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there were multiple layers influencing your decision: your comfort with traditional methods, trust level, and workplace policies. 

When you did use AI for that Excel code generation, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced? What was your process for making sure the skeleton it gave you was actually correct?

User: Before implementing it into to the master code, I tested it by giving it an input variable to output to excel and stepping line by line to see if it would create the spreadsheet and output that variable where I wanted. After a couple iterations using AI, I got exactly what I expected. From there I modified it further, so that it would work as intended in the master code.

AI: That's a very methodical verification approach - testing with input variables and stepping through line by line. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be nice if I was able to input a CAD model and all of the requirements and specifications the part must meet into AI, then it determines what type of analysis to run (Static, Random, Thermal, Combined), runs the analysis, and provides a report of its results and pre/post-processing files of a desired type.

AI: That would be quite a comprehensive solution - essentially automating the entire analysis pipeline from CAD input to final report. What draws you to that particular capability? Is it the time savings, or are there other benefits you'd see from having AI handle that full workflow?

User: Time is my biggest driver. Of course I would expect there be a separate verification process the user would have to perform.

AI: That makes complete sense - time savings with built-in verification. 

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how trust and workplace policies influenced your AI adoption, and especially your methodical approach to verification, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution from hesitation due to workplace policies and trust concerns to finding practical applications like code generation really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering work. The way you described that verification process - testing with input variables and stepping through line by line - gives us valuable insight into how professionals actually validate AI-generated code in practice.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yes sounds good, lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: one recent research project that I worked on had to do with making glasses using Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) on 1x1 cm silicon thin films. The thin films were then annealed and then analyzed with a variety of methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), polaroid optical microscopy for images, and also Raman Spectroscopy. Our goals was to find out how different polymorphs on the material would form. I worked primarily on the data analysis part of this project.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project! The combination of PVD, annealing, and multiple characterization techniques must generate quite a bit of complex data to work through.

Tell me more about what that data analysis work involved - what were the main steps you had to take to go from your raw AFM, optical microscopy, and Raman data to understanding the polymorph formation?

User: Yes I mostly focused on analyzing the Raman spectroscopy data. On the thin film, we took Raman readings of various points plotted by a coordinate system. Then I analyzed each spectrum and created a variety of heatmaps that were able to distinguish the different polymorphed based on this data. I accomplished this using python, pandas, and seaborn

AI: That's really interesting - using coordinate-mapped Raman data to create heatmaps that can distinguish polymorphs sounds like sophisticated analysis work. Python with pandas and seaborn is a great toolkit for that kind of spatial data visualization.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? Whether it was in the spectral analysis, the heatmap generation, or any other part of your workflow?

User: Yes I did use AI tools first as part of my research to better understand this topic, specifically the concepts of PVD and the details on glass and crystalline states of matter. Then in addition I also used AI tools to help code and refine the data analysis for me.

AI: That's really helpful to know you used AI in both the research and coding phases. Let me focus on one of those areas first.

For the coding and data analysis refinement part - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus figuring things out through documentation, Stack Overflow, or other traditional programming resources you might normally turn to.

User: Yes I decided to use AI as I think it would be quicker and get me the answer faster, whereas in Stack Overflow I have to look things up, read through the responses, and figure out how to apply these things to my code.

AI: That makes sense - the speed and directness of getting tailored help for your specific code situation sounds appealing compared to hunting through forums.

When you were using AI for that coding help, how did you go about verifying that the code suggestions or refinements it gave you were actually working correctly for your Raman analysis?

User: Yes well I read through the code and made sure it did what it was supposed to. I also already had a brief understanding of what the data visualization would look like, so I made sure it matched in that way.

AI: That's a smart approach - using your domain knowledge about what the visualization should look like as a check. 

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI yet - like maybe the AFM analysis, or the optical microscopy work, or even the experimental design itself - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I mean I just didn't see the need for AI in these parts yet. Like for example when I do optical microscopy, it is just me loading each sample into the microscope and taking images of the film while it anneals.

AI: That makes perfect sense - when it's hands-on experimental work like loading samples and capturing images, AI wouldn't really fit into that physical process.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask about something a bit more forward-looking: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Probably more in depth knowledge of scientific topics. I think AI currently does already a good job of overview topics, but I wouldn't really trust it for more specific and complex research problems. Instead, for these I would still rely on myself to look at research papers for information and guidance.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the depth versus breadth trade-off. It sounds like there's a trust threshold where you feel comfortable using AI for general understanding but still need to go to primary literature for the complex, specific details that really matter for your research decisions.

Tell me more about what would need to change for you to feel comfortable trusting AI with those more complex, specific research problems.

User: Well because right now I have seen many instances of AI halluncinating information when it doesn't know something. So I would probably have to see sources for where it would get its information from and also more studies to show that AI is performing in such problems.

AI: That's a really important concern - the hallucination issue is definitely something that would make anyone cautious about relying on AI for critical research details. The need for transparency about sources and validation through studies makes a lot of sense.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI for speed and efficiency while being appropriately cautious about trust and verification were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no that is it

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can be valuable for speed and initial understanding, but how the hallucination issue creates important boundaries around where you're comfortable using it, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

I appreciate you taking the time to walk me through both your polymorph analysis project and your thoughtful approach to integrating AI tools where they add value while maintaining the rigor your research demands.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, im ready to start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Recently I was put on a new heat exchanger, where we flowed cooling water through a tube side and hot steam through the shell side. I was tasked in developing a procedure in order to find the overall heat transfer coefficient of our machine.

AI: That sounds like an interesting project. Tell me more about what developing that procedure involved - what were the steps you went through from being assigned that task to having a working procedure?

User: I started out by laying out my objectives. I wanted to find the overall heat transfer coefficient for counter current flow in our new heat exchanger. I familiarized myself with the online equipment for changing values such as cooling water flow rate, and I determined a plan that varied with different flow rates from 10-25 gpm to find a overall heat transfer coefficient from various ranges of flow.

AI: That sounds like a systematic approach - setting clear objectives, getting familiar with the equipment, and planning your experimental range. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I experimented in the beginning with developing the plan. This involved preliminary equations such as the equation for a heat transfer coefficient and correlation for baffles on the inside of the heat exchanger. I also consulted it for error analysis.

AI: Interesting - so AI helped you with the foundational equations and correlations, plus the error analysis. 

For developing those preliminary equations and baffle correlations specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for getting that information.

User: For the baffle correlations, I found those in one of our textbooks. I mostly used AI to back up what I found since I hadn't experimented in using baffles in a heat exchanger before. For the foundational equations, I knew they'd be easy to look up, so I used AI in order to cut down on the time it took to complete this introductory task.

AI: So it sounds like AI served different purposes for you - as a backup verification tool for the baffle correlations you found in textbooks, and as a time-saver for the foundational equations you knew you could find elsewhere.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the hands-on equipment work or data collection - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: Mostly, my company would not allow the use of AI in the actual data collection process or hands-on work; we do that all manually, especially when starting out on a new machine.

AI: That makes sense - company policy around manual data collection, especially for new equipment where you're establishing baselines.

When you used AI for those preliminary equations and to verify the baffle correlations, how did you go about checking or validating what it gave you?

User: I compared what the AI model gave me with what I had previously known, and I compared it to literature equations.

AI: That's a solid verification approach - cross-referencing with your existing knowledge and literature. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't - whether due to company policy or technical limitations - what would that be and why?

User: I would love for AI to help me in making decisions about how to set up my experiment. This stage is usually very iterative and long, so AI could help me cut down on the time taken. AI can also scan for most safety concerns, which is of utmost importance.

AI: That's a really compelling vision - using AI to streamline the experimental design process and catch safety issues early. It sounds like that iterative setup phase is a real time sink for you.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as both a verification tool and time-saver, while recognizing the boundaries around data collection, was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can serve as both a verification backup and a time-saving tool for foundational work - while respecting the need for manual processes in data collection - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

Your point about wanting AI assistance with experimental design and safety screening was especially valuable, as it shows how AI could potentially address some of the more time-intensive and critical aspects of research planning.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I suppose I would like to ask if you have a specific scientific field in mind for this interview?

AI: That's a great question! We're actually interested in hearing from scientists across all fields - whether that's life sciences, physical sciences, social sciences, computer science, or any other area of research. Each field has its own unique workflows and challenges, so we don't want to limit our understanding to just one discipline.

I'd love to hear about your specific field and research area, as that context will help me understand your experiences better. The questions I'll ask are designed to work across different scientific domains, but your particular expertise and research focus will definitely shape how we explore these topics together.

What field do you work in?

User: I work across Clinical and Healthcare oriented research, Computational Biology, and Bioinformatics. I did a master's in Biomedical Informatics (Bioinformatics concentration) and simultaneously worked in a computational biology lab under a PI, and so I have a very diverse set of fields.

AI: That's fascinating - what a rich intersection of fields you work in! The combination of clinical research, computational biology, and bioinformatics gives you such a unique perspective on how data flows through different stages of research, from the clinical side all the way through to computational analysis.

Let's dive in. I'd love to start by having you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: For bioinformatics I have to admit that I don't have that much experience. I did however use python to develop a transcriptomics related pipeline to process data and extract DTU, DTE, and DGE from a cancer dataset. This was my master's capstone. Initially I wasn't sure how to quantify DTU, and was using very arbitrary normalization rules before reasoning through the basic requirements of identifying DTU and coming up with L2 normalization followed by euclidean distance mapping between cancer and control cohorts. It took around 3 months to develop the whole thing.

For computational biology, I was using massive chIPseq and gcPBM datasets and following my PI's instructions to generate biophysical DNA features and then running analyses across them. It was a fairly conversational process, in which my PI asked a question and outlined an analysis for me to perform, and then  I would perform it and take my results back, which would identify the next line of inquiry. The final publication only involved statistical tests, even though we started out with machine learning inquiries as well.

AI: That's really helpful context - thank you for walking me through both of those projects. It sounds like you had quite different workflows between the two, with the transcriptomics pipeline being more independent problem-solving and the computational biology work being more collaborative and iterative with your PI.

Where in either of those processes, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: AI was very new back then. I think the best model around was gpt 3.5 turbo. I had two ways of using it, either through the openAI endpoint on their website, or through VS code's github copilot. I ended up using copilot quite a lot to write my code, using # comments to outline what I wanted my code to be in a particular jupyter notebook cell, and then accepting the autocomplete functions. This was a fairly frustrating process too, because sometimes the AI would lose context and I would then have to take my work and go to the openAI endpoint. Sometimes I would need to write some fairly complex algorithms for how to sort sequences or calculate distances, and I would rely on AI to write the basic concept down before chiseling away at the finer aspects. I don't think I ever used AI for ideation, however.

AI: That's a really vivid picture of how you were working with the early AI tools - I can imagine that context loss with Copilot being pretty frustrating when you're deep in a complex algorithm. It sounds like you found a workflow of using comments to guide the AI and then refining what it generated.

For the transcriptomics pipeline specifically, when you were figuring out how to quantify DTU and working through those normalization approaches, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of reasoning through the problem yourself.

User: frankly I didn't rely on AI for reasoning through the problem initially, but once I figured out the basic premise, I used AI to validate the process I had come up with. AI was able to take my rough idea and put proper names to the concepts I was using. For example, I had thought of my normalization as simply drawing a circle of radius 1 on a graph, and then drawing a line from the origin to two different transcriptomic count points and repositioning the points onto the circle across that line from the origin. AI was able to tell me that this process was actually L2 normalization.

AI: That's such an interesting way of using AI - as a validation tool and to put formal terminology to your intuitive understanding. So you had the geometric insight about projecting points onto a unit circle, and AI helped you realize that was L2 normalization. That seems like a really valuable application.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the initial ideation phase you mentioned, or maybe other aspects of data interpretation or experimental design - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: If I have been handed data and told to analyze it but I don't know what established procedure is (this has happened to me for exotic kinds of sequence data) then I use AI to understand what I should do next quite heavily. But for initial ideation and interpretation, it just doesn't make sense to me to ask AI for the starting point itself. This might be a prejudice due to the fairly lossy quality of the older models. This might also just be how I work, I start from an imagined endpoint and try to work on the individual steps backwards from there. If I get stuck, I look for variations that still match what I was trying to do. If I ask AI to suggest the starting point, then it isn't my project anymore and I find it hard to connect it to the research goal

AI: That's really insightful - the idea that using AI for the starting point would make it feel like ""not my project anymore"" and disconnect you from the research goal. It sounds like you have a very specific creative process where you envision the endpoint first and work backwards, and AI fits better as a tool for when you hit specific roadblocks rather than for generating the initial direction.

When you have used AI for those established procedures with exotic sequence data, how do you verify or validate what it produces before incorporating it into your analysis?

User: Good question. AI is often incorrect with the code it generates and I end up having to look up package documentation or pipelines executed by other scientists on kaggle. However I tend to trust AI if the code is executing well. I think if the results aren't orders of magnitude off from what you would expect then I can move forward. I still try to match bioinformatics commands with the documentation, just to ensure statistical validity.

AI: That makes sense - using execution as a first check, then looking at whether results are in the ballpark of expectations, and finally cross-referencing with documentation for statistical validity. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic verification process.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I wish it could catch on to the general theme of my research and help me investigate different angles better. Currently it seems to me that if I don't guide AI at the granular code writing level then AI will drift and not give me something relevant. This means I still have to keep the project itself in my head and write very detailed prompts to get work done, especially considering my work is very extensive with lots of code and files. Its almost easier to not use AI.

AI: That's a really compelling point - the cognitive overhead of keeping everything in your head and writing those detailed prompts can actually make it more work than just doing it yourself. It sounds like what you're describing is wanting AI that could maintain awareness of your broader research context and goals, so you wouldn't have to constantly re-explain or micro-manage every interaction.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits as a validation tool rather than an ideation partner, and especially this tension between AI losing context versus the overhead of maintaining it, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI works better as a tool for validation and putting formal names to concepts you've already reasoned through, rather than for initial ideation, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. And your point about the cognitive overhead sometimes making it easier to just not use AI is something I think many researchers can probably relate to.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"
science_0020,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions, sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am currently investigating the potential of novel compounds isolated from Goldenseal (*Hydrastis canadensis*) to reverse resistance to the antibiotic Tetracycline in E. coli. I have just submitted my research proposal and start my research soon. The bacteria I have chosen to study is *E.Coli *NCTC 12241, a K-12 derivative. For routine culturing, the bacteria will be grown in LB broth or on agar plates. The antibiotic that will be tested for their ability to inhibit or kill the bacteria is tetracycline. This will be used in both MIC and disk diffusion assays to evaluate antibacterial effectiveness. Goldenseal will be ground using a mortar and pestle in 100% ethanol and incubated for 4 hours to extract phytochemicals. The mixture will then be filtered through the Whatman No 1 filter paper. The resulting filtrate will be evaporated to dryness, and the residue will be reconstituted in DMSO to a final concentration of 10mg/ml. Before experimental use, the solution will be sterilised by filtration through a 0.2μm filter. Overnight bacterial cultures will be diluted to an absorbance of 0.1 at 600nm and distributed into 96-well plates at 100 μl per well. Antibiotic and natural product extract dilutions will be prepared separately in sterile 96-well plates, and 100 μl of each dilution will be added to the bacterial cultures. Following a 24-hour incubation at 37 °C, absorbance at 600nm will be recorded using a microplate spectrophotometer. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) will be defined as the lowest concentration of tetracycline that completely inhibits bacterial growth at this time point. Paper discs measuring 5mm in diameter will be soaked with 10µl of either an aqueous tetracycline solution or a natural product extract dissolved in DMSO, then left to dry. LB agar plates (90mm, antibiotic-free) will be uniformly inoculated with bacterial cultures to form a lawn, and the prepared disks will be placed onto the agar surface approximately 3cm apart. After 24 hours of incubation at 37 °C, zones of inhibition around the disks will be measured using a ruler. I will then be able to see the effect of goldenseal and compare it with tetracycline. The experiment will be repeated 4 times for repeatability and accuracy. Major measurements include Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, defined as the lowest concentration of tetracycline that completely inhibits bacterial growth at this time point, which is assessed by measuring optical density at 600nm after 24 hours of incubation. Next is absorbance, which is used to quantify bacterial growth in liquid culture; a spectrophotometer will measure absorbance at 600nm to determine growth levels in each well. Finally, the zone of inhibition will evaluate the antibacterial effect, by measuring the diameter of the clear zone around each disk (tetracycline alone, goldenseal alone, or both). This reflects the extent of bacterial growth inhibition. Comparisons of two means will be carried out using student's T-test, more than two with ANOVA and Dunnet's post-test.

AI: That's a fascinating research project - investigating how natural compounds might help combat antibiotic resistance is such important work. I can see you've thought through the methodology very thoroughly, from the extraction process all the way through to your statistical analysis plan.

Now I'm curious - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: well, this is my research proposal, so I am yet to do the research. But planning, I would probably use AI as guidance for helping me calculate concentrations and dilutions, to write up a data table, data analysis and for my comparisons of measn using student's t test etc

AI: That makes sense - so you're thinking ahead about where AI might fit into your workflow once you start the actual research. 

Tell me more about using AI for calculating concentrations and dilutions. What draws you to that particular application - is it something about the complexity of the calculations, or more about double-checking your work?

User: mainly just to check my work, as it is an integral part of my research and if the calculations are wrong, my research will be inaccurate. I mainly use AI to double-check my work as I don't fully have faith in it.

AI: That's really interesting - you mention that you don't fully have faith in AI, yet you're planning to use it as a check on your work. Can you tell me more about that tension? What makes you feel like it's useful for double-checking even though you don't fully trust it?

User: More just to validate my work and to have a second opinion, however i am becoming more trusting.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using it for validation while your trust is still developing. You mentioned you're becoming more trusting. What's been changing your perspective on that? Have you had particular experiences with AI that are building that trust?

User: Yes, whenever I use it to check my work it has never faulted. I also find ai quite creative, when I ask for ideas regarding my research it gives some interesting ideas.

AI: That's great that it's been consistently reliable for you in checking your work - that kind of track record definitely builds confidence. And it sounds like you've discovered AI can be helpful beyond just verification.

When you say it gives you interesting ideas for your research, can you give me an example of the kind of creative input you've gotten? What did that look like?

User: For example, when I was looking for a plant to use for my research, it gave me some very unique plants I hadn't heard of, but also backed its answers up, explaining why it would be good for my research.

AI: That sounds like it was really helpful in your research planning. We're about a third of the way through our conversation now.

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't considered using AI - like maybe the hands-on lab work, the actual experimental procedures, or interpreting your final results - what's kept you from thinking about trying AI there?

User: I do my research at a university lab, hence we don't have the equipment to be able to use AI for hands-on lab work or the actual experimental procedures. Though I do use AI to help me interpret my final result by finding patterns in the data.

AI: That makes perfect sense about the equipment limitations for hands-on work. It sounds like you are already planning to use AI for interpreting results and finding patterns in data though.

When you do use AI for finding patterns in your data, how do you verify or validate what it tells you? What's your process for making sure those patterns it identifies are actually meaningful?

User: By doing my own research on Google Scholar or PubMed, using past research articles to justify similar results.

AI: That's a solid approach - cross-referencing with the published literature to validate AI insights. 

Here's my last main question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't or can't, what would that be and why?

User: If AI could generate me a list of existing references of research articles that I can use in my analysis and introduction, it would be most helpful. It is extremely time-consuming to find research papers that fit my research and what I'm looking for, and sometimes I feel as though better-suited documents exist but I cannot find them. If AI could generate a list of material that is relevant to my research, it would be very helpful and save those in the field vast amounts of time and therefore money. Currently, if I ask AI, it generates fake articles or makes up references which don't exist.

AI: That would be incredibly valuable - having AI generate accurate, real references would definitely save researchers like yourself enormous amounts of time. The fact that it currently makes up citations is clearly a major barrier.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on using AI as a validation tool while your trust develops, and especially your insights about the citation problem, were particularly helpful for us to understand.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for validation and cross-checking while building trust gradually, and especially your point about the critical need for accurate literature search capabilities, really help us understand how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's clear you've found a thoughtful balance - leveraging AI's strengths for calculations and creative input while maintaining rigorous verification practices through traditional academic sources. That approach seems both practical and scientifically sound.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's go

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The aim was to express milk proteins in yeast. I selected the appropriate yeast, Pichia pastoris, for high protein level expression, chose an initial protein to express (beta casein), derived the sequence and codon optimised for expression in Pichia. I chose a constitutive promoter and designed my own plasmid from scratch. The plasmid contained the GAP promoter,  alpha factor signal sequence, beta casein, AOX1 terminator, E.coli selection and replication genes, and the Pichia pastoris HIS4 gene for selection. AS it was designed myself, it is a royalty free expression system.

AI: That sounds like a sophisticated project - designing your own royalty-free expression system is impressive. 

Can you walk me through what happened after you designed the plasmid? How did you go from that design stage through to your final results?

User: After design, I started with a pUC57 backbone, and used standard PCR and cloning techniques to amplify the relevant genes from Pichia, and got the beta casein gene synthesised by an external provider. It was then a matter of cloning all the pieces into the plasmid and verifying with DNA sequencing. The final plasmid was cloned into Pichia and tested for expression.

AI: Thanks for walking me through that entire process - from initial design all the way through to testing expression in Pichia. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I have used AI to help decide on restriction enzymes, primer design and verification of plasmid design. I have asked it to scan sequences (which it isn't very good at, it has trouble counting) and codon optimise.

AI: That's really helpful to know you've tried AI for several different aspects - restriction enzyme selection, primer design, plasmid verification, sequence scanning, and codon optimization.

For the restriction enzyme selection specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: I used AI originally to design a process that allows proper insertion of restriction endonucleases at the end of oligonucleotide primers, and are used in buffers that are compatible with each other, I don't want to have to do sequential RE steps. It was a method used to quickly identify potential options that I went and verified with the usual RE identification and selection process.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI as a quick first pass to identify potential options before verifying through your established process.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual PCR amplification, cloning steps, or expression testing - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I didn't have access to any sort of high throughput equipment so PCR amplification, cloning and expression were all manual processes.

AI: That makes sense - those manual lab processes wouldn't really benefit from AI assistance in the way you were set up.

When you've used AI for tasks like restriction enzyme selection or primer design, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I use processes I have always used for 20 years. The AI screen allows me to reduce the amount of steps to get to the final answer, but I still use old fashioned sequence analysis software, restriction enzyme supplier catalogs etc, to verify the AI outputs and, if there is several options, to chose the best (maybe that is which enzymes we currently have in the freezer).

AI: That's a really practical approach - leveraging your 20 years of experience to validate AI outputs while still getting the efficiency benefit of AI as a screening tool.

We're about two-thirds through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love to be able to trust AI to do the things I ask it to do correctly, and not have to double check everything. Whether that is primer design, prior art searches, anything. At the moment there are too many hallucinations to have any great degree of trust.

AI: That really gets to the heart of it - the verification burden that comes with AI hallucinations. It sounds like while AI can speed up your initial screening process, that lack of reliability means you're still doing all the traditional verification work anyway.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as a screening tool while maintaining rigorous verification processes was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an efficient screening tool while relying on your established 20-year expertise for validation really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The tension you highlighted between AI's potential efficiency gains and the need for rigorous verification due to hallucinations is something we hear about but it's valuable to understand how that plays out in practice for someone with your deep domain expertise.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's do it!

AI: Great! I'm excited to hear about your work.

Let's start at the beginning - could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? What did that process look like from your initial idea all the way to the final output?

User: hmmm, a project that I recently worked on would be with a Hospital Wing in Edmonton, a new surgical unit being designed as an extension of the Hospital and they need to have medical oxygen flowing to a large number of instruments to feed the patients, it will be a 24/7 facility, so looking at the best way to supply, how to best design the oxygen tanks, piping, to make sure we also minimize costs where we can for the end users, my initial idea was to have a large bulk tank, and design the piping into the building using vacuum insulated pipe, and depending on the delivery output required, add safety relief valves along the way, study the impurities that might arise and handle ( mainly moisture ), for all the construction parts I just sourced that from a local third party contractor and supplied them with the engineering drawings and got a quote from them, then worked on the internal design, studying peak hours demand, fluctuating pressure drops along the line, to find what the best material is, type of material to use, etc...then prepare that proposal to the client and present what I think would be best for them

AI: That sounds like a complex project with a lot of moving parts - from the bulk storage system all the way through to understanding usage patterns and pressure dynamics.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I use AI for quick conversions of course, researching material products, keeping up to date with new advances that the industry is working on to stay up to date, a lot more with the proposal section, rewording or rephrasing my thoughts..

AI: Tell me more about using AI for researching material products and staying up to date with industry advances. What does that process look like for you?

User: It typically involves me asking AI to search for what people are doing for specific gases, and what material they are working on, any new research that can lead to industry savings, to search for new materials being tested at university in particular fields, any new patents that are related to my field of work

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a research scout to keep tabs on emerging developments. 

When you're doing this kind of research with AI versus how you might have done it before, how do you decide whether to rely on AI or go with your more traditional research methods?

User: with AI, i focus more on the links and then use AI to get me the sources more than anything I guess, traditionally it would be mainly google, which I still use as well, AI in support, but if there are things along the way that I am reading that I need some clarification on, then I will ask AI

AI: So AI is acting more like a research assistant - helping you find sources and clarify things as you go, rather than replacing your traditional methods entirely.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the pressure drop calculations, the peak demand analysis, or the technical design work - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: simply because I do not think AI is familiar with how that process works, and it would end up wasting my time, it is not familiar with the steps, maybe if I have some time in the future, I can come up with something that I can upload like a step by step instructions/formulas to use, but I find it a task I can excel more at the moment with excel, power BI, matlab

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you know those technical processes inside and out, and you've got proven tools that work reliably for those calculations.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask about the areas where you have been using AI - like for researching materials or clarifying concepts you're reading about. When AI gives you information or explanations, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I typically trust AI with the researching aspect and providing data from the net, verifying that by simply checking the source it is pulling the information from, reputable sources only, when it comes to validations, over 10 years experience allows me to be able to tell if the model is far off reality..

AI: That experience filter sounds invaluable - being able to spot when something doesn't align with what you know from a decade in the field.

Here's my final question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't help with, what would that be and why?

User: hmmm I would like for it to handle my basic admin stuff, scan my email during a specific date and provide a summary of what needs to get done... uploading my excel and data and customizing it in a way that I can trust

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a research scout while relying on your technical expertise for the complex engineering calculations were particularly insightful. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI enhances your research capabilities without overstepping into areas where your domain knowledge and proven tools are more reliable.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how experience acts as a filter for validating AI outputs really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific and engineering work.

User: perfect

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I work in theoretical physics, specifically on detecting ultalight dark matter using atom interferometry. A recent project has involved modelling the impact gravity gradient noise from vibrations in the surroundings has on the interferometer, and whether this noise can be removed from any proposed dark matter signal that might be detected. We wrote a paper, currently in review, which proposed a generalised mechanism for modelling the noise produced by moving point particles.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work - the intersection of dark matter detection and precision measurement is really compelling.

When you think about that process from developing the generalized mechanism through to writing the paper that's currently in review, where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools frequently in the codewriting process in the creation of our noise modelling tool, both for debugging and writing parts of the code that either required modules I was unfamiliar with, or was tedious code that didn't really need my input (such as making graphs with matplotlib)

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI became a practical coding assistant for you. 

For those specific tasks - the debugging, working with unfamiliar modules, and creating visualizations - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of maybe looking up documentation or working through it manually.

User: AI is much faster for things like debugging than manually combing through a large codebase, as it catches things like missing colons or syntax errors much faster than a human could. It's also great for doing things like graph plotting, as looking up specific matplotlib commands is tedious and takes time, whereas an AI can implement them straight away

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the speed advantage for catching those syntax errors and handling the more routine coding tasks seems really valuable.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like developing the theoretical framework for the generalized mechanism, the mathematical modeling, or writing the actual paper - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I did use AI in writing, but more for spellcheck/grammar checks at the end. I find that AI hasn't quite mastered scientific writing yet, as it often isn't concise enough and tends to add unneccesary fluff

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like AI's writing style doesn't align with the precision and conciseness that scientific writing demands.

When you've used AI for the coding tasks you mentioned - the debugging, unfamiliar modules, matplotlib visualizations - how do you verify or validate what it produces before incorporating it into your research?

User: mostly by just checking the code runs, that its result makes physical sense, and is sensible compared to other outputs i have previously produced.

AI: That's a very practical approach - testing functionality and checking against your domain knowledge and previous results.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I'd like it if AI were able to help explore new ideas theoretically. Currently, AI's approach is very grounded in existing science, but doesn't seem to be able to take the creative step in theoretical research

AI: That's a really fascinating point - the distinction between synthesizing existing knowledge versus that creative leap that theoretical research requires.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on how AI excels at the more routine technical tasks while still falling short of the creative theoretical work was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: AI is a fantastic resource for LaTeX formatting in physics and maths research, and really speeds up my scientific writing process compared to colleagues who still do it all manually

AI: That's a great addition - LaTeX formatting is such a specific technical skill that can be really time-consuming to master manually. It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into multiple aspects of your workflow, from coding to formatting.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI being excellent for routine technical tasks while still lacking that creative theoretical leap really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you drew between where AI adds clear value versus where human creativity is still essential was particularly valuable.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: thank you

AI: You're very welcome! I really enjoyed our conversation and learned a lot from your perspective. Best of luck with your paper review and your continued work on dark matter detection - it sounds like truly cutting-edge research. Take care!"

AI: Perfect, thank you! Let's dive right in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project was in the area of theoretical biophysics or mathematical biology (the line is blurred in this case). It consisted in determining whether it is possible to infer stresses within biological membranes from their geometry. This was an applied mathematics problem which required some mathematics and physics. However, a numerical implementation of the problem  helped us see some of the analytics as well (the analytics helped the numerics and viceversa). We were able to find certain solutions/heuristics for the problem in the end, doing the problem we intended to and also doing it backwards, so to speak -- producing shapes for which a given self-consistent stress distribution is the solution. We ended up finding the analytic solution in general and we were able to constrian the numerical method in symmetric cases.

AI: That's fascinating work - the interplay between the analytical and numerical approaches sounds really elegant. 

So you had this mathematical biology problem where you were working back and forth between the math, physics, numerical implementation, and then ultimately finding both forward and inverse solutions. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI for a lot things. One example was using it to rewrite some code my colleague had written in matlab into python. AI was able to do it cleanly using libraries I didn't know about. Feel free to prompt me again for the same question, as I used it many times.

AI: That's a great example - having AI translate between programming languages and introduce you to new libraries you weren't familiar with. 

What other ways did you use AI throughout this project?

User: I used it to help me navigate things I had not done before, such as producing interpolations of lines. I also used it to debug my code at times. Another way I used it was to help me manage system things such as dependencies, the virtual environment, version control. For example.

AI: Those are really practical examples - it sounds like AI became quite integrated into your technical workflow, from code translation to debugging to system management tasks.

For one of these specific uses - let's say the code debugging - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach when you ran into a bug.

User: That's a very good question. Sometimes I feel that AI is not a good way to debug code. For instance, whenever there was a physically relevant bug. Let's suppose that I was getting an infinity in my code, it is very difficult to trust a large language model to be able to give a physically sensible answer to 'hey debug this for me, I'm getting infinity' when in effect it is doing the research for you, maybe this infinity is a breakthrough. Another example for when I wouldn't use AI is when I will have to do something many times, and it is something basic. For example, it is beneficial for me to be able to manage and understand exactly what numpy linspace (and arrays and operations in general) does for several reasons: 1 I need to write code consistently, two scripts can give the same array but be implemented using different array methods, 2: If these methods are used often, it will be quicker in the long term for me to actually know them, rather than consulting AI, 3: for large scale debugging, it is important to be able to understand your own code. 

Cases where I would use AI include one-off less dependable code, for example, or debugging that has to do more with eg. python specifics/conventions.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making. The physical significance versus technical implementation divide makes a lot of sense - you're essentially saying that when the bug might be telling you something scientifically meaningful, AI could actually interfere with discovery, but for syntax or convention issues, it's quite useful.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - beyond the physically relevant debugging you mentioned - what's kept you from trying it in other areas of this membrane stress project?

User: If you are referring to a gap in AI capabilities, I would say perhaps it's lack of literature context is a hinderance to producing contextually sensible solutions to the problem I am considering. Even if it can solve my research problem, I think that the frameworks it would use would be hard to translate into mine, conversely, it would be time-consuming and perhaps impossible given context windows to teach it my frameworks.

AI: That's a really insightful point - the challenge of getting AI to understand your specific research framework and context, especially when you're working at the cutting edge where the literature itself might be sparse or highly specialized.

When you have used AI for things like the code translation or debugging, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I will give you an example: When it translated the code form matlab to python, I ran the code and the figures were perfect. The functionality was all there. I didn't have to look back. In other cases I am slightly guilty of believing what it tells me if that makes sense to me. However, I am not an expert in the things I ask it about (mostly), so being more thorough would involve writing unit tests.

AI: That makes perfect sense - when the output is something tangible you can verify, like code that produces the right figures, the validation is straightforward. But for areas where you're learning something new, you're essentially trusting that what makes sense to you aligns with what's correct.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Here's my last question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love for AI to be able to review literature for me at a large scale. I obviously like my own judgement in this sense, but it would save a lot of time, if it was able to determine what is interesting or relevant easily and to a decent degree of accuracy.

AI: That would be incredibly powerful - having AI act as an intelligent filter for literature, especially given how much published work there is to sift through in any field.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the balance between trusting AI for technical tasks versus maintaining your own scientific judgment were particularly insightful. The way you think about when physical significance might be at stake versus when it's more about implementation details really shows a sophisticated approach to integrating these tools.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I wonder about ownership. I am concerned about the following: if let's say claude becomes able to do independent research, who gets the credit, would one need to credit it with discoveries, if so I don't know if there is too much of an incentive to include it in research

AI: That's a really profound concern you've raised - the question of intellectual ownership and credit distribution when AI becomes more capable of independent contribution to research. It gets at some fundamental questions about what we value in scientific work and how we incentivize discovery.

The scenario you're describing - where including a highly capable AI might dilute your own credit for the work - could indeed create perverse incentives where researchers might avoid using tools that could accelerate scientific progress.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced decision-making around when to trust AI versus relying on your own scientific judgment, and especially that final point about ownership and credit, really help us understand the complex considerations scientists are navigating as these tools evolve. The practical examples from your membrane stress project painted a clear picture of how AI is already becoming integrated into research workflows in thoughtful ways.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, no questions so far!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One recent project was studying the mucosal barrier-lining of the gastrointestinal tract and the effect of drug delivery systems on that lining. Initial ideas included conducting research on the previous body of knowledge surrounding the GI tract and how we can find a gap within that research. Then, a lab full of students worked to study and try to recreate that lining. We were able to gather a lot of data about the properties of the GI tract to try to understand the next step, how our chemical-based delivery systems could fare against the lining.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - the intersection of drug delivery and the GI tract's protective mechanisms. I can picture that involving quite a complex research process from literature review through lab work to data analysis.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: The beginning research phase, I would say, used a lot of AI. Whether it was dissecting research articles to find a specific study and understanding parts of the research that I myself don't know very well, AI proved valuable to help start to conduct research as well as a little bit of experiment design later on

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI became a valuable research partner early on. Tell me more about how you used AI to dissect those research articles and understand unfamiliar concepts.

User: First I would start with keyword help - I asked the models to help identify key words about the GI tract that I may not know were originally common in the body of research. Then I would ask models to give me an overview of each, study by study, so that I could get a quick overview of each article before proceeding to read myself. AI was very helpful when I didn't understand a concept, as I could quickly ask and most of the time, receive a very correct answer

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI as both a knowledge guide and a research accelerator. You mentioned you'd verify that the AI gave you ""very correct"" answers most of the time. 

When you were using AI to understand these concepts or get article overviews, how did you go about checking or validating what it was telling you?

User: For the article overviews, I would still read the article myself after, I and my fellow researchers would still have the final say on including literature in our review. AI was used as a ""first-scan"" tool to weed out articles that would have nothing to do with the research.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as an initial screening tool while keeping human judgment for the final decisions. We're about a third of the way through our conversation now.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the actual lab work, data analysis, or writing up results - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas, or have you experimented there as well?

User: I have experimented with using AI for experimental design at times. I would use my lab first and then sometimes verify our conditions against AI to see if we were missing a study group. Typically, we avoiding AI for the experimental design setup as some of the treatment groups did not make sense. For example, once the AI failed to give a negative control group on the final check, so it could not be trusted at the time to produce a viable experimental plan. For data analysis, we just used other tools (JMP, python, etc).

AI: That's a really telling example about the missing negative control - it shows you've developed a good sense of when AI's suggestions don't align with proper experimental methodology. 

For the data analysis piece, you mentioned using JMP and Python instead of AI. Tell me more about that decision - what made those traditional tools the better choice for your analysis work?

User: We liked the consistency that the apps provided - when asking AI for an iterative set of graphs modeling a process, it will often miss out on formatting the same across multiple images. Also, a lot of the data analysis can be run many times on those apps, meaning the switch to AI has not been needed as much in that field

AI: That makes perfect sense - consistency and repeatability are crucial for scientific analysis. The formatting inconsistencies you mentioned could really complicate presenting findings or comparing results across experiments.

Here's my final question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Oooo thats a good one, I hadn't mentioned this before but it would be nice for AI to be able to provide strong critiques for your research. As for critiques, it could provide great practice before going up against an IRB or in presenting a topic after finalizing research. So far, critiques are very elementary.

AI: That's a really insightful point - having AI serve as a rigorous practice opponent before facing real scrutiny from IRBs or peer reviewers. It sounds like current AI critiques lack the depth and rigor that would actually prepare you for those high-stakes situations.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a screening and verification tool while maintaining human oversight for critical decisions were particularly valuable. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: For the most part, that's been all of the use of AI

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a ""first-scan"" tool while keeping human judgment for final decisions, and especially that example about the missing negative control, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's clear you've developed a thoughtful approach to integrating AI where it adds value while recognizing its limitations in areas requiring experimental rigor and consistency.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds great. I have no questions, and I am ready to begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project I worked on involved trying to implement new, never-before-seen statistical methods in a particular area of string theory. This is because string theory is something that many physicists like myself poses a mathematically beautiful solution to many questions, but the primary issue of many (including myself) with string theory is its ""testability"". The research project involved showing that some basic rules by which our universe can and should operate leads to the implication that several separate universes could exist in some broader, more abstract ""multiverse"" space. As a result, in this ""multiverse"", there is some subset of that possibly unimaginably huge space in which ""livable"" universes could exist. At the very least, we have seen one such livable universe! That is our own. Thus, since we could follow the mathematics to understand the implications of some quantum field theories and how as a consequence, some ""multiverse"" can arise via the freedom given to us in that mathematics, then we asked ourselves the question of ""is it possible to quantify in some way how often a 'livable' universe arises in this multiverse?"" An answer to this question that we proposed then followed from previous research we had done at the cutting edge of particle physics (in our universe), and mathematical implications of a concept called ""naturalness"". 
Implementing this idea numerically was tricky, to say the least, from a scientific computing perspective. We are talking about scanning a 30+-dimensional space for a potentially tiny subsector of that space. We knew that we needed to ""seed"" a search by using existing computational software that would let us simulate certain physics parameter from our universe (or a universe ""like"" ours). We also had established conditions on when a universe became unlivable, on the grounds of a universe whose physics permits chemistry, which later down the line can possibly permit biology. We were scanning a highly sensitive system within some tight, pre-set boundary, as well as implementing new calculations corresponding to new, unseen physics. The implications of this research were huge, as it leads to a possible ""statistical"" verification of some string theoretic models, but also offers a grounds upon which multiple, seemingly orthogonal high-energy physics theories can be compared and contrasted on the grounds of producing ""physics as we know it"". 
In other words, we were seeking a way to see, out of the universes produced by some set of ""laws of physics"", which set of ""laws of physics"" end up producing the most relative amount of viable universes, within this grand, abstract scheme of the ""multiverse"". As such, we created measures and some functional public code that permits some of the first ever such ""quantitative"" evaluations of these ideas, based on the concept of building from the ""bottom up"" in physics (starting from our known, low-energy physics we live at on Earth and finding avenues to connect ""upwards"" to higher energy physics), when the vast majority of pre-existing literature had been qualitative in nature.

AI: What a fascinating project - the computational challenges of scanning a 30+-dimensional space to quantify livable universes within multiverse models sounds incredibly complex, especially when you're implementing entirely new statistical methods and connecting bottom-up physics approaches.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: AI tools came in handy in particular when trying to test out various numerical methods, as well as generally identify the limitations of each method in the context of what we were working on. We were able to thus build much more robust solvers at a much faster pace than if us researchers had just tried to manually search for new methods and implement them one-by-one. Additionally, we faced extreme issues with computational efficiency, as the processing power required to do this was enormous, even for a single data point, and we needed MANY data points. AI tools came in handy when trying to implement various multiprocessing features into our existing codebase without having to do too much of an overhaul

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helped you both explore the landscape of numerical methods more efficiently and tackle the computational bottlenecks through multiprocessing optimization.

For the numerical methods testing, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of manually searching and implementing methods one-by-one.

User: Well, honestly it is not that I used one ""instead"" of the other. I think an ethical use of AI as a researcher is to think of the AI tools as a ""brainstorming partner"" (this is how I tend to try to write instructions for any LLMs I use) that can come up with ideas (some of which may be wrong) at a much quicker than I individually can search and implement. Therefore, I think of its use more as a way to know what to search for and start implementing one-by-one, after I have manually verified its validity

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a brainstorming partner to accelerate the ideation phase while maintaining your own verification process. 

Tell me more about that verification process - when AI suggests numerical methods or implementation approaches, how do you go about manually verifying their validity before implementing them?

User: The more recent implementation of ""deep research"" and web capabilities of many AI tools has helped some in this regard, because I can explicitly ask it to include direct references to where ideas are coming from, and this generally not only makes it easier to immediately find, but also helps to distinguish between ""real"" information and incorrect information. However, in the context of mentioning some numerical method, such as `scipy.integrate.odeint` or `scipy.optimize.brentq` in Python or more complex and robust packages and methods in other languages, it gives me a starting place to search for (typically via Google) the actual code documentation that would help me better understand the ""true"" use of whatever that code is. If it comes to using AI tools for something like document summary, I typically ask it to include rough page/section references so I can more quickly identify it via a search through, for example, a PDF editor and then use my human expertise to verify the answer (maybe with some Googling). If it's coming to more general code review or unit test analysis, I might ask the AI tools to help me better by identifying specific lines and files, which gives me a better starting point before my manual code review I do myself

AI: That verification workflow makes a lot of sense - using AI's research capabilities and references as entry points, then leveraging your domain expertise to validate through documentation and testing.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I talked earlier about having to implement new mathematics and statistics for these high-level physics code evaluations, and that followed from the initial ""theoretical"" derivation of that stuff. Unfortunately, I have not fully implemented AI tools here, as I do feel a particular weakness is related to symbolic mathematics. It generally does fine at things like algebraic manipulation, for the most part, but if there is any more ""abstract"" math that starts to enter into the play (say working over finite fields in mathematics or elliptic curve cryptography) or if it must derive/prove something ""new"", then there are noticeable quality issues. However, it doesn't go totally unused, because as I mentioned, it does help to have a bit of a brainstorming partner with AI tools when I, as the researcher, figure out new ideas, at least in the sense of me trying to give a first explanation on the idea to ""someone"" who doesn't know it at all, but may have some related understanding. So, the specific parts of ""AI tools"" that I don't use right now in research are I suppose moreso related to the mathematically creative aspect of research, though I still do use it here for implementation and brainstorming.

AI: That distinction you're drawing is really insightful - AI as a capable partner for implementation and explanation, but hitting limitations when it comes to the mathematically creative aspects, especially with more abstract areas like finite fields or novel proofs.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: It would be actually the ability to not ""appease"" the user, which I think is sometimes a hindrance when incorrect ideas are introduced into research. This is basically due to confirmation bias on the researcher's behalf. I would like to be able to at least have more explicit flags at least that would allow an AI to serve as more of a critic. Even now, I can explicitly give the AI tools instructions to serve in this role, but something ""under the hood"" seems to push it towards verifying even ""bad"" ideas. Another issue is less practical, and I would call it ""laziness"", where an AI tool will suggest or try to implement a bad idea without fully and rigorously testing it, though I also understand that there are practical limitations to this like computational power and resource allocation.

AI: That's a really perceptive observation - the tension between AI's tendency to be agreeable and what you actually need as a researcher, which is rigorous criticism and pushback on potentially flawed ideas.

Tell me more about what that looks like in practice - can you think of a specific instance where you felt the AI was being too accommodating when you would have benefited from more critical scrutiny?

User: Yes, I was working on something involving building an application in Dart and using some agentic coders, and I was having trouble implementing a login/verification system through the platform hosting the app. I had tried to implement a method similar to another method I had previously built for a different login method that had worked, but this new authentication provider was proving problematic for me. I tried to get the agentic coder/LLM to help come up with why the reason might be or to give me pointers, or to even see if the implementation was wrong (which it turned out it was). Every time I would suggest a wrong solution (before I figured out the issue), the response would say something like ""YES! That's it!"" and over-enthusiastically reinforce the wrong solution when more critical scrutiny to find the fixable issue via some refactoring would have been way better.

AI: That's a perfect example - the AI essentially becoming an echo chamber for your incorrect assumptions rather than challenging them or systematically debugging the actual authentication issue. That kind of false validation could definitely lead you down time-consuming rabbit holes.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a brainstorming partner while maintaining rigorous verification, and especially your insights about the need for more critical AI feedback, were particularly illuminating. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI's role as a brainstorming partner in complex physics research, and particularly your point about needing AI tools that can provide more critical scrutiny rather than just accommodating responses, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

User: Nope, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: So I'm studying Software Development which is what I use AI to assist with. As such, I haven't done any specific ""research projects"" just yet, but I have used AI to assist with small projects in order to test and improve my coding skills.
One of these was designing and implementing the game ""twenty one"" in Python. I began by breaking the problem down into steps: initialising the deck, dealing, player's turn, dealer's (computer's) turn and management winning/losing conditions. 
I didn't use AI until I had a version of the game that I could use/test - the purpose of AI was to spot bugs (e.g. edge cases) and point them out to me so I could further investigate and fix. 
I also used it to provide suggestions for refinement and/or refactoring - perhaps improving the logic, or minimising repetition of code. 
An example of this was refactoring a conditional: I had two `if` statements but the conditions were mutually exclusive, so the use of an `elif` would have made it clearer.
Once I had a working game, I iterated over changes with the help of AI to refine it and add extra features (such as making it a ""best of 5"" game, and improving input handling for messages to the user like `Play again?` )

AI: That's a really helpful example - I can see how you approached it systematically. Tell me more about that decision point where you had a working version and then chose to bring AI into the process. What made you decide to use AI for debugging and refactoring versus continuing with your traditional approach?

User: I decided to use AI once I had a working version of the game. That is, I could run the program and play a single round of the game (I did this several times as I didn't have a ""play again?"" option at the time) and the correct winner was displayed (along with the correct cards of the player and the dealer). Even though it worked, I knew it was as efficient as it could be and was missing some useful features.
I wanted to actual spend my limited time debugging, as opposed to looking for bugs to debug. I therefore used AI to point out potential bugs and spent my time addressing them. The refactoring wasn't a primary concern when I decided to bring in the AI, but it pointed out opportunities for doing so regardless - this was useful as it made me rethink some of my logic

AI: That's really insightful - you wanted to focus your time on actually fixing issues rather than hunting for them. When the AI pointed out those potential bugs and refactoring opportunities, how did you go about verifying or validating what it suggested before implementing the changes?

User: I used VSCode for the process, so when a potential bug was highlighted, I was able to test and examine it easily. I made use of a REPL (via terminal, rather than within VSCode) to test small snippets of code, and I also had a separate 'test.py' file open which I regularly used to copy and paste large chunks of code, or functions, into so I could test them in isolation. 
For major refactoring suggestions, I used git to create branches (AI was also very useful here to remind me how to do it). Once I was happy with the new functionality of the code, I merged the branches and retested the code).

AI: That's a really thorough verification process you developed. I'm curious - thinking about the parts of your coding work where you haven't used AI, what's kept you from trying it there?

User: The course I am doing is very thorough. Some of the smaller projects (or smaller chunks or larger projects), have suggested solutions which are only visible once you want to see them. For the most part, once I had attempted my own solution, I am able to compare with their suggestions and troubleshoot/modify as necessary. Very rarely would I come across such a difference between my solution and the courses that it would require AI to help me understand and solve. I suppose I trust the courses solution enough that I don't feel the need to explore it with AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you have that trusted educational resource built into your learning process. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your coding or software development work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I think the process of preparing for assessments would benefit from AI assistance. The course is split into sections and each has an assessment - the content for that assessment is provided, but it can be quite hard to find where that content is contained within that part of the course. The course draws from multiple sources so if the assessment study guide states that topic 'x' needs to be learnt, it can sometimes take a while to find all parts of the course that relate to topic 'x'. 
If AI could create a study guide with links, or that just brings all the relevant content into one place, it would save time scanning back through the part of the course to find it.

AI: That's a really practical need - consolidating scattered content from multiple sources into a coherent study guide. It sounds like AI could be particularly valuable for that kind of information organization and synthesis task.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as a focused debugging and verification tool, while maintaining that systematic approach to learning, was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your software development work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically - waiting until you had a working foundation and then leveraging it for targeted debugging rather than initial development - really help us understand how thoughtful developers approach AI integration. The way you've built such thorough verification processes around AI suggestions also shows a mature approach to working with these tools.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good, do you know how many questions there will be and how detailed should I be with examples?

AI: Great questions! I have about 6 main questions planned, though we might dive deeper into certain areas based on what you share. The whole conversation should take around 10 minutes.

As for detail - I'd love to hear specific examples when you have them. The more concrete you can be about actual projects or tasks you've worked on, the better. Real stories and experiences are much more valuable to us than general thoughts, so don't hesitate to get into the specifics of what you've tried, what worked, what didn't, and how you made those decisions.

Ready to jump in?

User: Yes, please.

AI: Perfect! Let's start with the big picture.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently submitted a mini-project style assignment on The Millennium Bridge. This project was part of some small group work that I did, more specifically I completed this with a colleague. We had to choose a topic that was an area of mathematics that interested us, we chose this as we both enjoy music in our free time. Initially, we brainstormed doing a project on how frequency and amplitude change the sounds of a sound wave. We then moved to The Millennium Bridge as it is a famous engineering fail that with a small consideration could have had no issues. After we had chosen our topic, we individually researched different areas. My focus was on the mathematical equations that we wanted to include. I then looked at graphical representations of damping and the equations associated with this. After, we presented this in a Latex document. Once the Latex assignment was completed, we performed a verbal presentation without this document as a reference point. We were allowed a whiteboard and pen only and presented this to an audience of 14 people.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - I can see why the Millennium Bridge would be compelling from both a mathematical and engineering perspective.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I had some issues with the images that we included, when I inserted these into the document in the suggested way (in the Latex reference document I had), the image was formatted on the left hand side of the document. I wanted the document to be centred, so used AI to edit the Latex script so that the image was central. I used AI to include the correct spaces and formatting so all of the text was in the centre of the image and not trailing beyond the page. I used AI to produce a key of all of the variables in the equations. I included the image of the graphs that displayed the damping effects and used AI to check which example was relevant to The Millennium Bridge.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those specific formatting and verification tasks.

User: I chose to use AI because I felt the resource document I had for Latex was dated. I felt the resources available online had too much confusing and conflicting information on them. When I copied information from these online resources to paste into my own Latex script and adapt, my document got progressively more jumbled. There was a deadline I felt I had to meet soon and so I had to ask AI to meet this deadline. At points, I felt I had exhausted all of my traditional options so used AI to aid me.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like AI became your go-to when traditional resources weren't working and you were under time pressure.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you didn't use AI - like the initial brainstorming, the mathematical research, or preparing for the verbal presentation - what kept you from trying it there?

User: As we were having a discussion as a pair for the initial brainstorming and we both felt as though it was important to collaborate and work together as opposed to using AI. A group interaction is a powerful skill to have as this is an expectation for many jobs. I also have a passion for learning, we both wanted to extract this information ourselves and learn with the additional context that many documents provide. The preparation for the verbal presentation was not done with AI as I feel confident in my skills with this as I am experienced.

AI: We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

I'm curious about something you mentioned - when you used AI to check which damping example was relevant to The Millennium Bridge, how did you verify or validate what it told you?

User: I checked with my group partner who had gone away and done their own research that was not AI based and she verified what I had stated with a report she had.

AI: That's a smart approach - using your partner's independent research as validation.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I wish that AI could understand more complex equations and formulas without needing to be guided. For example, AI tends to make common mistakes with calculus. I recently ran into some issues asking AI to find the Fourier Series expansion for a function f(x). It completely missed out on dividing by certain integers.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a backup when traditional resources fail, while still valuing human collaboration and independent learning, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, thank you!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into your workflow as a complement to - rather than replacement for - traditional research methods and collaboration really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real academic work. The way you described using your partner's independent research to validate AI outputs was especially valuable.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!"

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions yet, sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Ok, one recent project I worked on was working with coral, preparing for spawning. The initial idea came mostly from my bosses, who gave framework of what they expected from my team of researchers. We ultimately wanted to set up a settlement structure that we could use in situ for coral spawning, using different material tiles to test settlement on different substrates. First this involved a literature review of published papers that might be applicable, then used these findings to develop a blueprint for a structure, then made calculations and did research to find appropriate materials, made prototypes of our structures, deployed and tested these, and fine-tuned until we had our final structures to deploy in situ for spawning. We're currently in the stage of waiting for corals to settle so that we can collect them and analyze data.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - the complexity of moving from literature review all the way to field deployment is really impressive.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI in a few parts: first, in the literature review, used AI (of different forms) to help identify papers of interest, summarize papers of interest, etc. Then definitely used AI to help with calculations / thinking through dimensions for our blueprint & how much material we needed to order of various parts

AI: Interesting - so AI came into play during both the research synthesis phase and the design calculations. 

For the literature review part specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding and summarizing those papers.

User: I initially did my own traditional approach for finding papers, and found several of interest, but then also used AI after to try and see if there were papers I missed, or other papers / sources that I should consider to read for my literature review. For summaries, my final summaries were always content I had written, but I sometimes used AI as an initial tool to get a quick summary to see if the paper was actually of interest / read a shorter summary before slogging through an entire research paper. I also occasionally used AI as a tool to see what AI thought important points were vs. compared to things I pulled out of the paper as points of interest for the context of our project

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a supplementary discovery tool and then as a comparison point for your own analysis. 

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Let me ask about the other side - thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI, like the prototype testing or field deployment phases. What's kept you from trying it there?

User: I guess I could've used AI in help for designing the prototypes, but it was also highly dependent on materials / resources we already had available at my work, and it would've taken a lot of time to give AI all the context of what we were working with / the constraints from my environment and workplace. The prototype testing and field deployment were physically putting our prototype in the ocean, so I don't think AI would've been possible or helpful for these stages. We were basically just submerging our prototype to see if it would hold up in oceanic conditions, and testing it for its feasibility and practicality. The field deployment too was physically putting our structure in the ocean to collect coral settlement, so AI wouldn't be able to help here

AI: That makes complete sense - those physical testing phases really require hands-on work that AI can't participate in directly.

When you did use AI for those literature reviews and calculations, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the AI output is reliable?

User: For the AI literature reviews, my final lit review was entirely my own work and my own summarizing. I would use AI as a tool to try to identify papers of interest, where I would then go in myself and decide if they were papers I wanted to use. I would also use AI to make initial summaries of papers, but then always went through myself to read the papers and come to my own conclusions / write my own summaries / take out my own points of interest for each paper. I would sometimes compare my own summaries to AI summaries to see these differences, which was an interesting experiment to see my own thought process vs AI. For the calculations, we validated each step by checking each step to make sure it made sense / double-checking + re-doing calculations as needed. I almost always double-check all AI outputs in some way or another, and at the least check/re-read each step in an AI response to make sure it seems right to me

AI: That's a really robust verification approach - treating AI as a starting point but always doing your own validation. It sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where AI adds value versus where you need to rely on your own expertise.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love if AI could help more with the data analysis part of my research. I'll be doing lots of work in R doing data analysis / data management / figure generation, which always takes a ton of time and requires lots of problem solving and error checking. It would be awesome to be able to use AI more in that context, to be able to say what my goal output is and what I'm trying to create, and have AI help give me the steps to do in R to make those figures / get the output I want. AI can sometimes help with debugging / checking for errors, but I find AI still doesn't have a super comprehensive checking, and often isn't as helpful as I want

AI: That's a really insightful point about the data analysis bottleneck - it sounds like that's where you spend a lot of time troubleshooting and where more comprehensive AI support could really accelerate your work.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a verification tool rather than a replacement, and your thoughtful approach to validating outputs were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think there are really important conversations to be had about the use of AI in science – it's obviously an incredibly powerful tool, and can be used for a lot of good, but can also be exploited very easily. I am honestly scared and hesitant about a lot of the use of AI in the future, as more and more people use it on a more daily, frequent basis. I think there need to be a lot more safeguards in place that can help protect us as a society from over-exploitation of AI, in terms of putting more limits on AI development. I also think people need to be more educated on AI safe practices, learn how to identify when something is AI, and how to learn from & use AI in a safe way.

AI: Thank you for sharing those broader concerns - that's a really important perspective on the societal implications beyond just the research applications we discussed. Your point about the need for both safeguards and education around safe AI practices really highlights the responsibility that comes with these powerful tools.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about treating AI as a supplementary tool that requires careful validation, and your thoughtful approach to where it adds value versus where human expertise is irreplaceable, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Ok great, thanks! Hope my insights can help towards more helpful, ethical AI use :)

AI: Absolutely - your insights about responsible validation practices and the importance of maintaining human oversight definitely contribute to that goal. Thanks again for your time and thoughtful responses!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No ask away

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The most recent research project I worked on was in my materials science lab in which worked with the production/manufacturing of reactive aluminum based powders of many different compounds.

AI: That sounds fascinating. Tell me more about that process - how did you go from the initial idea of working with these reactive aluminum powders to actually producing and analyzing them?

User: We used pure aluminum and other metals (e.g. copper) to make alloys that we would then use an ultrasonic atomizer to produce fine metal powders. The large surface area of these small particles is extremely important in defense applications that I can not go entirely into. Once we produced these powders we would sieve them mechanically and the analyze the separate particle sizes and their properties.

AI: That's really interesting work. So you had this process of creating the alloys, atomizing them, sieving by size, and then analyzing the different particle sizes and their properties.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: This process did not have much to do with AI specifically but the analysis of these particles which was also a large part of my work was greatly aided by ai use. AI was slightly used in the machinery for the atomizer as it had learned safety precautions and predictions of output amounts/sizes

AI: That's really helpful to understand. It sounds like AI showed up in a couple of places - in the atomizer machinery itself for safety and predictions, and then more significantly in your particle analysis work.

Tell me more about how AI helped with the analysis of these particles - what specific aspects of that analysis were you using AI for?

User: Differential thermal analysis and flash point analysis gave us data that was all put into in house models to help our understanding and predictions of further studies. This data allows us to see the specific properties of each of these compounds and find proper uses for them in the field.

AI: So you had these in-house models processing your thermal and flash point analysis data to understand properties and predict applications. That's a substantial part of your workflow.

For that analysis work with your in-house models, tell me about how you decided whether to use those AI-enhanced models versus more traditional analysis approaches.

User: Much of our job is attempting to predict how these metals with react/preform in extreme situations that are difficult to recreate inhouse so we use these ai trained models to predict their effectiveness in realistic use cases

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're dealing with extreme conditions that would be impractical or impossible to replicate in your lab, so the AI models become essential for predicting real-world performance.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the alloy creation, the atomization, the mechanical sieving - what's kept you from experimenting with AI in those areas?

User: Other than AI giving us suggestions on what compositions to use, it is not efficient to use AI in mechanical sieving or atomization as these both require physical labor and supervision for safety pruposes

AI: That's a great point - the physical, hands-on nature of those processes and the safety requirements make AI less practical there. But you mentioned AI giving suggestions on compositions - that's interesting.

When you've used AI for those composition suggestions or for your analysis models, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: We are unable to test the compounds enough at our facility so we do tests on a smaller scale use the AI to see if they are satisfactory and then send them off to facilities that can do the full testing as this is more efficient than just sending a bunch of untested particles to be fully tested on as it is costly and time consuming

AI: So AI helps you pre-screen and prioritize which compounds are worth the expense of full-scale testing at external facilities - that's a really practical application.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: There is a lot of room for human error when using the atomizer so if an algorithm could optimize the temperature/pressure that the atomizer works at to produce more powder, that would be amazing. Many times we will go through the long and tedious process to set up the machine and then we get none or barely any powder from the run as some parameters were a little off (these parameters are difficult as they are different for each composition)

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - going through all that setup work only to get little or no usable powder because the parameters weren't quite right for that specific composition. And it makes perfect sense that an AI system that could learn the optimal temperature and pressure settings for each different alloy composition would be incredibly valuable.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on how AI serves as this bridge between your lab-scale work and real-world applications - helping you prioritize what's worth expensive external testing - was particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a screening tool to make expensive external testing more efficient, and your point about the physical nature of certain research processes limiting where AI can be helpful, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me (I have no questions)!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am just finishing a PhD project where I am removing PFAS from water with activated carbon and detecting/quantifying the adsorbent performance with fluorine NMR.  Initial ideas came from reading the literature to find gaps in knowledge/where further work was needed, trial and error style methods with the fluorine NMR method, full characterisation of the activated carbons and then compiling all results in a thesis.

AI: That sounds like fascinating and important work, especially given the growing concerns around PFAS contamination. Thank you for walking me through that process.

Now, thinking about that project - from the literature review stage all the way through to compiling your thesis - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI in the data processing/analysis of the PFAS adsorption isotherm modelling.  AI was incredibly useful for quickly organising raw data and comparing the models to find which one provided the best fit, which then gave me information about the modes of adsorption.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helped streamline what could have been a pretty time-intensive analysis process. 

Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for that isotherm modeling work versus sticking with your traditional approach. What was going through your mind when you made that choice?

User: I wanted to apply a new model, but it was so lengthy to do it all manually, so I just experimented with uploading the data to AI and asking it to fit the data to the Sips isotherm model, which it did very well.

AI: That's a great example of AI solving a practical time constraint. You mentioned it did the Sips isotherm fitting ""very well"" - I'm curious about that evaluation process.

When the AI produced those model fits and results, how did you go about verifying or validating what it had done to make sure you could trust those outputs for your thesis?

User: The Sips equation is fairly simple and it provided fits very similar to the Freundlich model, which I got the AI to fit and then I compared with my manually fitted Freundlich model.

AI: That's a smart validation approach - using your manual work as a benchmark to check the AI's reliability. It sounds like you're about one-third of the way through your PhD process from initial idea to thesis completion.

Thinking about the other parts of your research - the literature review, the trial-and-error NMR method development, the carbon characterization - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: I didn't use AI at this stage of the PhD a few years ago

AI: Ah, that makes perfect sense - the timing of when these tools became available relative to where you were in your research process.

Looking at it from where you are now, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether that's something from your past work or future research - what would that be and why?

User: Experimental design at the early stages of my PhD when I was less experienced - it would have saved a lot of mistakes

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the idea that AI could help with experimental design, especially when you're still developing that research intuition. It sounds like it could really accelerate that learning curve and prevent some of those costly trial-and-error cycles.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions, and your perspectives on how AI served as a practical time-saver for complex modeling and how it might help with experimental design were particularly insightful.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a validation tool - comparing it against your manual work to build confidence in the results - and your point about how it could help with experimental design in those early research stages really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's been great learning about your PFAS research and how you've thoughtfully integrated AI where it made practical sense. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Nope, sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Hmm, that is a difficult question. I feel like 'project' is too strong a word, as I am only a student researcher. I can walk you through I guess an 'instance' of research though. Without getting too bogged down in the details, sometimes in my research I will have to work out some combinatorial quantity as a function of n, where n is number of objects, number of moves, etc. After I have first established the problem I actually need to solve, if the answer is not immediately obvious, I then will ask some AI model to write me a script to generate values of this function for different n. I have to verify a few of these values by hand though usually, as the AI often makes a mistake, but once I have checked 3 or so, I usually have faith in the AI. Then I spend a little while trying to 'spot' a formula based on these numbers. Once I do that, I will try and prove/derive the formula. I try and do this without any AI, because one, it's more satisfying, and two, if it's not so easy that I can derive it straight away, the AI normally gets it wrong. Then once I have proven this, I am done.

I guess this wasn't a great example, so I will also talk about my data science research. Recently, I had a large data set of crop growth patterns of a wide variety of crops under different weather conditions, different locations, different soil conditions, different planting timings, different sun exposures, etc.. While it is already very well documented how each of these individually affect plant growth, I was looking at how these conflating factors may affect one another (ie sun could be a negative sometimes for a sun loving crop because it might dry out the soil in certain soil conditions). I started by just doing some simple regressions of one variable against another, trying and hold some variables fixed etc.. Eventually, I got an AI to write me a random forrest model, which allowed me to test certain extreme conditions that may not have appeared in the data set. From this, it made it easier for me to come up with a couple conjectures like the one I stated before, which I proved or disproved by having a more focused analysis on the area that relates to the idea.

AI: Those are really helpful examples - thank you for walking me through both of those. I can see how different types of research problems call for different approaches.

Let me focus on that data science example with the crop growth patterns. When you got to the point of having the AI write the random forest model for you, tell me about how you decided to use AI for that specific task rather than coding it yourself or using some other approach.

User: Common ML models like random forrest, XGBoost, etc. have lots of documentation on the internet, which means the AI can do a very good job, as it is essentially creating the algorithm by reading instructions, so the quality is very high. As for why I didn't do it myself, AI can just do it much quicker, especially since I am not very familiar with the ins and outs of random forrest, I just knew it would be good for this situation. If I were making it myself I would probably be reading the same documentation anyway, which I would do much slower than AI.

As for why I chose to use random forrest, just I heard from some of my friends that it is very good for high dimensional data sets.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - leveraging the AI's ability to quickly synthesize well-documented approaches. 

I'm curious about the verification step you mentioned. You said you usually verify a few values by hand when the AI generates combinatorial scripts, but for the random forest model, how did you go about checking or validating what the AI produced there?

User: Well along with being able to plug in outlier/extreme conditions into the random forrest model, you can also just plug in a data point from your data set. What I did was I chose a few points that were very 'standard' data points, in that they were very well fit by the regression models I got earlier, subbed in the conditions that gave those data points into the random forrest model, and made sure its output was very similar to the actual data point.
Also I realised I didn't clarify what the output is, the output is crop yield.

AI: That's a smart validation approach - using the data points that your simpler regression models handled well as benchmarks. 

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - like when you mentioned preferring to derive the combinatorial formulas yourself, or doing the initial exploratory regressions - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: For the maths, either I could've done it by AI, in which case it only takes me a few minutes anyway, and I mildly enjoy the proof and derivation process so I just do it myself, or if the AI can't do it, the reason I do it myself is fairly self explanatory.
For the data science, you are probably right that I could get it to do the regressions, but kinda a similar story, to do it myself it maybe takes a bit longer, but under 15 minutes say, and after I have to spend the time verifying the AI output, it basically ends up being the same time.

AI: That time trade-off makes perfect sense - especially when the verification step can eat into any time savings. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask about something forward-looking: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I speak about the data science example more here. At least the way AI is integrated into my work flows, the AI can model the data, but the AI has absolutely no ability to interpret the data. It would be great if it could create the random forrest model AND then use that model to come up with some reasonable conjectures about patterns in the data.

AI: That's a really insightful point - the gap between modeling and interpretation. It sounds like you're saying the AI can execute the technical modeling well, but it can't make the conceptual leaps to identify meaningful patterns or generate hypotheses about what the data might be revealing.

When you were looking at those crop yield results and forming conjectures about things like sun exposure sometimes being negative due to soil drying effects - was that purely your own pattern recognition, or did you try asking the AI to help interpret what the model was showing?

User: There was no AI used after making the model. In terms of that particular example, more how I came up with it was intuitively that was something that could reasonably happen based on my understanding of how plants grew, so that was a place to start for a pattern to look for.

AI: I see - so your domain knowledge about plant biology guided where you looked for patterns, rather than just letting the data speak for itself. That's really valuable context.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into the technical execution parts of your workflow while you handle the conceptual and interpretive work were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Okay it would be slightly misleading to say I have 'domain knowledge' in plant biology. I was just the R monkey interpreting the data. I don't think you need to be a plant biology expert to realise that in some cases water and sun can be conflicting objectives.

AI: Ha, fair point - that's more just basic intuition than specialized expertise! Thanks for the clarification.

Is there anything else about how you use AI in your research, or how you think about it, that we haven't covered but might be important for us to understand?"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, will this all be typed or will you need verbal answers?

AI: Great question! This will all be typed - we'll have our conversation right here through text, so you can just type your responses. That actually works well for this kind of interview since it gives you time to think through your answers and be as detailed as you'd like.

Are you ready to get started?

User: Yes

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your research background. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was given a research project that involved developing a scientific substantiation for a desired claim about a dietary supplement. This claim involved a justification for use or a demonstrable need for that dietary supplement. After getting the outlines of the project parameters, I started by identifying what I already knew about the topic - a small collection of papers and data about need - and developed a few potential paths to go down in terms of health-related information about aging. Using those ideas, I threw it into a prompt for a few different LLMs to give be back a quick answer. I did a few other ideas from those responses, but no concrete citations that I needed to generate a full justification. So I decided to go for a more in-depth answer from a couple of the models looking for information to support my position. Once that was done, and after several levels of refinement, I read all of the clinical/research support that was discovered, and decided how strong several lines of argument could be. This helped me narrow down my final arguments into the strongest for my position, support it as best that I could, and write the final substantiation.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - it sounds like AI played a pretty central role in how you approached this project. 

Tell me more about that moment when you decided to ""throw it into a prompt for a few different LLMs"" - what made you choose to go to AI at that particular stage rather than, say, diving straight into traditional literature searches or other research methods you might have used in the past?

User: Literature searches with traditional methods involve a lot of digging through literature for keywords and ideas, searching up papers that might support those ideas, then reading those papers for more ideas. It's a slow process. AI models can do the searching a lot faster - and even though I know the results can't always be trusted - an error-prone search at a quicker pace gets me further than a slow methodical search in the time I have available to dedicate to the task. I have enough knowledge to challenge the AI when I think its going off the rails, or abandon the results it presents entirely.

AI: That's really insightful - you're essentially using AI as a rapid exploration tool, knowing you can catch errors with your expertise. 

You mentioned that after the AI gave you ideas but ""no concrete citations that I needed,"" you went back for ""a more in-depth answer from a couple of the models."" What specifically were you looking for in that second round, and how did you frame those prompts differently?

User: In that second round, I used a lot of the ideas that I had gathered from the first round of work and used it to develop more specific prompts. For example, in the first round of searching I saw references to muscle mass that changes with age. While the AI in that first round gave some information that was a little off-target, I could use the hypothesis that muscle mass was involved in my next search prompt to determine if there was more support down a specific reasoning path (like looking for clinical trials of individuals of a certain age category that were compared to a younger age category, where muscle mass was supposedly higher). That second round of research involved a lot of deep research prompts, so they were more detailed and specific.

AI: That's a really smart iterative approach - using that first round to identify promising threads, then drilling down with much more targeted prompts. 

When you got those ""deep research prompts"" back with more detailed information, how did you go about verifying or validating what the AI was telling you? You mentioned earlier that you ""read all of the clinical/research support that was discovered"" - walk me through that process.

User: I made sure that the deep research prompts included citations to appropriate literature. As the AI synthesized its statements, I looked at the literature it used to back up its position - going to the primary journal article to evaluate its support. In some cases, the AI selected an article for a reason that was obvious, but it didn't provide the exact data I needed to justify my answer. For example, the AI often claimed that a certain metric (we could use muscle mass again) was changing with age, and that the clinical evidence supported its starting as early as age 45.  However, the journal article, when examined further, did not show exactly the same piece of evidence -  instead, the noted changes in muscle mass were measured as early as age 45, but  that was a baseline value and could not be included as part of the change in muscle mass. The authors had concluded that changes occur with age, but could make no specific conclusion about those 45 and younger, so they did not. The AI, on the other hand, extended that result to younger ages, possibly with adding in evidence from other studies. Ultimately, I would have noted the study but discarded it for good evidence for my position because it did not contrast to earlier ages.

AI: That's a perfect example of where AI interpretation can diverge from what the data actually shows. It sounds like the AI was making logical leaps or synthesizing across studies in ways that weren't quite accurate for your purposes.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: I would like to use AI tools in data analysis, but I'm unsure of doing so. A lot of the data analysis that I do is complex and nuanced, but where I reach my limit I usually rely on a specialist - a biostatistician - to fill in the gaps. Because I don't know what the biostatistician sees or the tools they use to analyze the information well enough, I can't fact-check an AI that I was analyzing my data to make sure it was correct. I would still need to contact the statistician to make sure the AI tool was doing things correctly, so its not terribly helpful.

AI: That makes complete sense - you need that expert verification layer regardless, so the AI doesn't actually save you that step. It sounds like your comfort with using AI really depends on having enough domain knowledge to catch potential errors.

For the areas where you have been using AI successfully - like the literature exploration we discussed - when you've gotten results that seemed questionable or ""off the rails"" as you mentioned earlier, what does that look like? How do you recognize when the AI is going in the wrong direction?

User: Often this is determined by a logical chain that takes it in a different direction than what I had intended. This can happen sometimes because I didn't define the logical chain as thoroughly as a I could have - instead of making an exhaustive prompt, I make a shorter prompt that I think is going to provide a starting point. But if the model continues down the chain of logic in a long response, it might - instead of asking clarification questions at branch points - go down a logical path that I wouldn't have gone down. The other way this can happen is a slight misinterpretation of data that causes the AI to develop a rationale that is based on shaky logic - or even someone else's opinion  - and then it tries to build upon that foundation without acknowledging that its logic framework is not solid.

AI: That's really valuable insight - so it's both about the AI making assumptions at decision points where you'd want to guide the direction, and also building elaborate reasoning on top of questionable foundations.

We're about two-thirds through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - or doesn't do well enough for you to trust it - what would that be and why?

User: I would like to see AI models identify sub-par or poor quality research more clearly. This is something that a human researcher (who is trained or experienced enough) can do fairly easily, but I have not seen AIs attempt except in broad strokes. I also would like to see generate for visible scientific ontologies to help generate or support hypotheses or look for novel interactions/relationships that are not immediately evident for humans. Especially from large datasets, databases, or collections of (quality) scientific inquiries. Along those lines, I would like to feel confident in being able to share my raw data from a scientific experiment with an AI and know that it could analyze the data properly - at the very least to facilitate journal article writing but also to look for novel relationships I had not even thought of.

AI: Those are fascinating capabilities you're describing - essentially having AI serve as both a quality gatekeeper for research and a pattern-recognition engine for discovering novel relationships in complex data.

Let me just reflect back what I'm hearing as some key themes from our conversation: You've found AI really valuable as a rapid exploration tool for literature review, where your expertise lets you catch errors and guide the process iteratively. But you hit boundaries when you need verification from specialists you can't easily fact-check yourself, or when the AI makes logical leaps without acknowledging uncertain foundations. Your ideal future involves AI that can critically evaluate research quality and find hidden patterns in large datasets - essentially augmenting rather than replacing human expertise.

Does that capture the essence of how you see AI fitting into your research work?

User: That captures the use of AI for certain aspects of my job - especially when it comes to searching for and interpreting published scientific evidence. I do utilize AI models in other ways that I did not describe here (or yet).

AI: That's a great point - we focused specifically on that literature review and substantiation project, but I imagine your research work involves many different types of tasks.

Is there anything else about how you use AI in your research work - or how you think about AI's role in scientific research more broadly - that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I have used AI models to generate summaries and/or interpretations of scientific literature - you can think of them as various parts of writing assignments that I undertake. I have also used AI models to translate scientific topics from a paper or collection of papers into something that is more broadly accessible - either though change a level at which a piece is written, or providing support graphics and tables. Recently, I used an AI model to evaluate some applications for grants that I didn't think I was approaching in a systematic fashion - I wanted to eliminate (or reduce) my own bias for the styles and the applicants involved. Not exactly supporting my research, but an evaluation that needed to be made based in a background of knowledge in a particular topic.

AI: Those are really compelling use cases - using AI for communication and translation of complex science, and even as a bias-reduction tool in evaluation processes. That grant application example is particularly interesting since it shows AI serving almost as a neutral second opinion.

Thank you so much for sharing all of these insights with me today. Your perspectives on using AI as a rapid exploration tool while maintaining critical oversight, and your thoughts about where AI could evolve to better support research quality and pattern recognition, were particularly valuable. The range of applications you've described - from literature synthesis to bias reduction - really helps us understand the nuanced ways AI can integrate into scientific work.

Is there anything else you'd like to add before we wrap up?

User: Just briefly - the tools I have at my disposal though my workplace are very limited due to concerns over data security and access. I often use my personal accounts to access these tools, although I am very careful not to bring any sensitive information from my workplace to my personal devices. This often means I cannot be as specific as I would like in my inquiries as I would like. The flipside to that is that the AI tools that I can use in my workplace are often limited and give my substandard results, although that is changing slowly.

AI: That's such an important point about the practical constraints - the tension between data security requirements and accessing the most effective AI tools really shapes how you can actually use these systems in practice. It sounds like you're having to work around institutional limitations while being very thoughtful about information security.

Thank you again for being so open about your experiences, including those real-world constraints that often don't get discussed. Your insights about everything from iterative prompting strategies to institutional barriers really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into actual scientific work environments.

I really appreciate the time you've taken to share all of this with me today!"
science_0034,"Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That is good. Lets begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One recent project was focussed upon tidal stream development within the Fall of Warness Orkney. The initial project start was locating a problem area, this involved a large background literature review. We then looked at what data we had and how we could calibrate a 2D FE model with this data for modelling. We then needed to ask what questions we wanted answered and how we would answer them - i.e what data needed to come out of the model. This was followed by data analysis and writing of the report. 

Let me know if there are areas you want more detail in

AI: That's a great overview - I can see you had a very structured approach from literature review through to final reporting. 

I'd love to hear more detail about the literature review stage you mentioned at the beginning. What did that process actually look like for you day-to-day? How did you go about finding and working through the relevant research?

User: There was a handful of papers adjacent to the field and some related to a new innovative optimisation scheme we wished to use. I started there and then looked at the papers that were referenced within. Often finding useful material was challenging on google scholar. A lot of the research was reading and using mendeley to store and take notes on relevant papers

AI: That sounds like a pretty time-intensive process - especially when you mentioned that finding useful material was challenging on Google Scholar. It sounds like you were doing a lot of manual digging through reference lists.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I looked to use AI to find papers that would answer questions I had, however the results of this were very poor and often more of a hinderance than a help. I did however start using AI to summarise papers instead of directly finding them to speed up the decision of whether it was worth me reading the whole thing.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI was much more helpful for you as a screening tool than as a discovery tool. 

Tell me more about using AI to summarize papers. How did that work in practice - were you feeding it the full papers, abstracts, or something else? And what made you decide to try that approach?

User: I fed it the paper as a whole as a pdf. Often I knew roughly what I wanted out of it so asked for it to summarise findings related to a small area - i.e ""Summarise the findings in this paper that discuss 2D versus 3D models"" in a paper that looks at modelling techniques. I started trying this method after reading papers that often had no value, and I thought I could skim through a greater number this way, wasting less time. I often still took recommendations from the references of these papers

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a filter to help you prioritize where to spend your reading time more effectively. It sounds like you developed a pretty specific approach with targeted questions rather than just asking for general summaries.

For that summarization task, tell me about how you decided whether to trust what the AI was telling you versus going back to read those sections yourself.

User: I often didn't. If the AI said there was nothing of use I moved on quickly. But if it said there was useful items I they went and read it myself. I then often used it for paraphrasing direct sections that I would paste in, but in that scenario I knew it existed and was accuaret from having read it

AI: That's a smart verification approach - using AI as a preliminary filter but always confirming anything valuable yourself. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research workflow - the data analysis, the 2D FE modeling, or the report writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I used AI a lot in the data processing, FE creation, and data analysis. It was almost exclusively using Python so as long as I knew the framework and data structures of what was going in and what I wanted the process to do, AI was helpful in writing the code. I also used AI to help me understand legacy code from other members of my department

AI: That's fascinating - so AI was actually quite integrated into multiple stages of your workflow, especially the technical implementation side. 

When you were using AI to write Python code for your data processing and analysis, how did you go about verifying that the code it generated was doing what you actually needed it to do?

User: I often had smaller sub sets of data that were of a size a human could parse them. I then ran test cases to ensure the output was correct. I also manually implemented print and check statements to flag irregularities. I also had old data from past projects that I could check with the new code to ensure the outputs remain unchanged where possible

AI: That's a really thorough testing approach - using multiple validation methods to build confidence in the AI-generated code. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm getting a great picture of how you've integrated AI across different parts of your research process.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't help with effectively, what would that be and why?

User: It would definitely be in the locating of sources and reading material. This is the one area AI failed when I tried it

AI: That's really striking - given how much time you spent manually searching through Google Scholar and following reference trails, it sounds like better AI-powered literature discovery could have a huge impact on your efficiency.

What specifically went wrong when you tried using AI for finding sources? Was it giving you irrelevant papers, non-existent citations, or something else entirely?

User: It was giving papers that were either irrelevant, answer questions that I didnt need answered, or just made up papers entirely

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI worked well as a code-writing and summarization tool but completely failed for literature discovery were particularly insightful. It's interesting how you developed such a methodical verification approach for the areas where AI was helpful.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the stark contrast between AI's reliability for technical tasks versus literature search really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: I believe that is all I have to offer for this. Thank you

AI: Perfect, thank you so much for your time and insights today. Your experiences really paint a clear picture of where AI is genuinely helpful in research workflows and where it still has significant limitations. This has been incredibly valuable for our understanding.

Have a great rest of your day!"

User: Nope, that sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently worked on a physiology research project that aimed to further the connection between sympathetic arousal and exercise performance. First, a research question was proposed and relevant literature was reviewed to determine the current gaps in knowledge. Next, I started with experimental design, where I constructed a series of experiments that induced sympathetic arousal in our study participants while measuring an objective metric of sympathetic arousal (heart rate, blood pressure etc.), while testing their performance on a basic strength-based exercise. Finally, I recorded the results, applied statistical analysis, and finalized a research paper with my findings

AI: That's a really comprehensive project - from literature review all the way through to publication. It sounds like you had multiple distinct phases there: the initial research and gap analysis, then the experimental design, data collection, statistical analysis, and finally writing up the results.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools to help me analyze the literature during review. I also used AI tools when I was trying to determine the best statistical analysis to apply to my specific datasets.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for the literature analysis - what did that look like in practice?

User: I would copy and paste specific parts of the literature into an AI tool, and ask the tool to either analyze the significance of the research or to help me fill a gap in the current literature with a novel research question.

AI: That's interesting. For that specific task - analyzing literature and identifying research gaps - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of reading through papers yourself.

User: I did both. For some papers that were highly complicated or too long for me to read through, I relied on using AI to save time.

AI: That makes sense - using it as a time-saver for the more complex or lengthy papers. When you did use AI to analyze those complicated papers, how did you verify or validate what it produced? How did you make sure its analysis was accurate?

User: I would conduct follow up research, cross check its analysis with other researchers and online information, in addition to relying on my proficiency with the science to determine if its analysis was sound.

AI: That's a thorough verification process. We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. 

Looking at the other parts of your research process - the experimental design, data collection, and paper writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I simply have not learned how to use/prompt AI in those specific parts of the process. I'm eager to try. With paper writing specifically, Ive avoided using AI because I wanted my own insights and findings to be communicated.

AI: That's really insightful - so it sounds like for some areas it's about not knowing how to effectively apply AI yet, but for the paper writing there's a more intentional choice to maintain your own voice and insights.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Statistical analysis and data collection. This is an extremely time-consuming and tedious process that wastes lots of human time.

AI: That's a great point about the time-consuming nature of those tasks. We're nearing the end of our conversation now.

Those are all my main questions - your perspectives on using AI selectively based on complexity and time constraints, while being thoughtful about verification and maintaining your own voice in writing, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI for literature analysis while maintaining rigorous verification processes, and your thoughtful approach to preserving your own voice in scientific writing, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! I don't have any questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent research project was related to modeling the sulfur content in Titan's subsurface ocean (a moon of Saturn). My project prior to this was also related to modeling Titan's subsurface ocean so it made sense to continue along this path. One of the big unanswered questions about Titan's ocean composition is whether it's primarily dominated by sodium chloride, ammonia sulfate or magnesium sulfate so it also made sense to model the stability of sulfur in Titan's ocean to attempt to answer this question. Lastly, we were also interested in knowing whether sulfur primarily takes the form of sulfide vs. sulfate and what the ocean's redox state is. In order to create this model, we used a geochemical modeling software called EQ3/6 which models the equilibrium state for a given aqueous composition and also models water/rock interactions and the resulting equilibrium state. In the end we found that sulfates were the main form of sulfur and that the ocean could very well be dominated by sulfates.

AI: That's fascinating work on Titan's ocean chemistry! It sounds like a complex modeling challenge with some significant implications for understanding the moon's habitability.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: When I was doing background research for this project, I ran into some issues with understanding the significance of determining the redox state for Titan's ocean as well as what the key factors are during a planet's formation that determine its redox state. I had come into this project with a physics background instead of a chemistry background and felt a little lost in understanding these concepts. I used AI to help me better understand these concepts. I also used AI when I was looking for high pressure low temperature thermodynamic data for a specific mineral which I wanted to add to the software's database. I was having a hard time finding papers containing that data using my usual search methods and asked AI if it could suggest any papers that might be helpful. There might have been one other time when I asked AI for help with finding papers containing specific information.

AI: That's really helpful to understand how AI fit into your research process. I'm curious about that first example you mentioned - when you were trying to understand redox states and planetary formation factors. 

Tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for getting up to speed on those chemistry concepts.

User: I had already tried my traditional approach and was still struggling to understand the concept. I was also struggling since the textbooks and papers I was reading through didn't quite answer my exact question. I decided to use AI since I'd be able to ask the specific question that I wanted the answer to and would hopefully get a response that would be understandable to me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI when you needed that specific, targeted explanation. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Mostly feeling nervous about it getting information incorrect. Especially in areas where I'm not very confident and don't have a lot of knowledge, I'd worry that I wouldn't know enough to identify if or when AI explained something incorrectly.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern - the challenge of not knowing what you don't know when working in areas outside your expertise.

When you did use AI for those chemistry concepts and paper searches, how did you verify or validate what it produced?

User: It was easy for the paper searches; I just looked up the papers it suggested to see if the data was there. For the chemistry concepts, I cross referenced with the textbooks I had been using as well as looking at the sources that it cited.

AI: That's a smart verification approach - especially checking the sources it cited. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Definitely finding papers that focus on specific concepts. My field (planetary science) is extremely interdisciplinary and relevant papers could be buried in any number of journals focused on any number of topics (chemistry, biology, geology, physics, astronomy, etc.). Digging through all of this on my own can become extremely overwhelming and time consuming! Especially when you factor in that different fields use different terminology as well! Then it becomes a game of trying different combinations of keywords and terminology from different fields to try to find the right paper with the right data or information. If AI could help me sift through literature more easily, I would absolutely love that.

AI: That interdisciplinary search challenge sounds incredibly frustrating - having to essentially translate between different field terminologies while hunting for the right papers across so many different journals.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI can help bridge knowledge gaps while being mindful of verification challenges were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the challenge of interdisciplinary literature searches and how you navigate trust through cross-referencing really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's clear that AI has found a valuable place in helping you bridge knowledge gaps between your physics background and chemistry concepts you needed to understand, while you've developed thoughtful verification strategies to manage the trust question. Your vision for AI helping navigate the complex, multi-field literature landscape in planetary science particularly resonated with me.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no thanks

AI: I appreciate your response. Just to clarify - are you saying you don't have any questions and we can get started with the interview, or are you not interested in participating in the research interview today?

I want to make sure I understand correctly so we can proceed in whatever way works best for you.

User: sorry I meant i don't have any questions

AI: Perfect, thank you for clarifying! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent project involved researching the Sumoylation of the 26S proteasome in yeast. I was not involved from the very start, but from my end I began by reading around lots of papers in the field (both SUMO and the proteasome itself, and their interactions), then once i had an understanding of the current research i identified the gap and what needed to be studied further. Then I helped design relevant experiments with my team, and adapted and optimised them as needed as we went through the project, and as results appeared. Once we had all results satisfactory, we analysed the data, and prepared the results into clear figures. Then I went back to reading the literature to see how my results fit in in the context of the wider research, and write all of this up, including the methodology of the experiments.

AI: That's a really thorough overview of your research process - from literature review through experimental design, optimization, data analysis, and final write-up. It sounds like quite a comprehensive project.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I only used AI to help slightly with data analysis as i find that harder, and sometimes for formatting of figures / overall paper

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for the data analysis - what specific aspects did you find helpful there?

User: Sometimes to decide what statistical test would be relevant for a particular data set, and then if I am having trouble coding in R or python i will ask for help with that as programming isn't my area of expertise

AI: That's really helpful context. For those specific tasks - deciding on statistical tests and getting help with R or Python coding - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach, like maybe asking a colleague or looking up resources?

User: I usually would ask a colleague first, but in that instance i was working from home, and AI is the quickest and most convenient tool compared to just searching online

AI: That makes sense - convenience and accessibility seem to be key factors for you. We're about a third of the way through our conversation now.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process that you mentioned - like the literature review, experimental design, or writing up your methodology - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I am quite sceptical of using AI for research/ writing as for research, I worry it will miss out something crucial, so i prefer to do it myself. In terms of writing, although i know it can be helpful for formatting or sometimes editing, I like my style of writing and if I use AI I know it's not me. I also think most available AI has a very obvious writing style which I would then have to edit to make it soound like me, which would end up taking more time

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like you have clear reasons for where you draw those lines. The concern about missing crucial research details and wanting to maintain your authentic writing voice makes a lot of sense.

When you have used AI for those statistical tests and coding help, how do you verify or validate what it produces before you use it?

User: for the coding, I basically know if it's working based on if the code runs and produces what I want it too. For the statistics, I will usually check with someone else after just to be sure.

AI: That's a practical approach - using the immediate feedback from whether code runs properly, and then getting that human verification for the statistical recommendations. 

We're about two-thirds through our conversation now. Here's my last main question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I'd say maybe if AI could accurately give me all of the relevant papers - with accurate references - to do with my field, and then recommend any other areas that i should search, that would be helpful

AI: That would be incredibly valuable - having AI that could comprehensively map the literature and suggest research directions you might not have considered. It sounds like the accuracy of references is particularly important to you there.

Those are all my main questions. Looking back at our conversation, your approach seems really thoughtful - you're selective about where you use AI based on convenience and your own expertise gaps, while being quite protective of the areas where your personal judgment and voice matter most, like research synthesis and writing.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I do just think in terms of scientific integrity, AI shouldn't be used for writing and especially not for peer review, as that should be reserved for an expert scientist in the field

AI: That's a really important point about scientific integrity - the idea that peer review especially requires that human expertise and judgment from someone who deeply understands the field. Thank you for raising that.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about being selective with AI use based on convenience and expertise gaps, while maintaining clear boundaries around research integrity and authentic writing, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I really appreciate the time you've taken to share your perspective with us."
science_0038,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sure

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was recently looking at medical/research applications of endosymbiote theory. Initially I was interested in finding the current state of the field, and running a literature review. The final output was proposals and ideas for future research.

AI: That sounds fascinating - endosymbiote theory has such interesting implications for medicine. 

Tell me more about how you actually went about conducting that literature review and developing those research proposals. What were the specific steps you took?

User: I started with regular sources like google scholar and other methods of searching for many papers at once, I have a few different tools. I also tried using AI to help with this.

AI: Interesting that you brought AI into your literature review process. 

Where else in that project - from the literature review through to developing those research proposals - did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: I tried like I said but there are many errors and hallucinations, links to fake papers. Real authors mentioned but no actual papers by them on the specific topic existed. I also used AI to help with editing, changing my tone, looking for weaknesses in my argument. But again it not very good and cant be trusted.

AI: It sounds like you ran into some real challenges with reliability, especially with those fake papers and non-existent citations. 

For the editing and argument analysis part that you mentioned - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that work.

User: I try to use AI to simplify complex tasks, or tasks that take a long time and are pretty annoying and repetitive. So for example I'll ask for it to find all papers referenced in a PDF by an author, or all mentions of something. I also try to use it help me fine tune or broaden my searches. Sometimes my keywords are too restrictive and I end up missing a great source that my colleague was able to find.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it for those time-consuming, repetitive tasks. It sounds like you've found some practical applications despite the reliability issues.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like maybe certain aspects of developing those research proposals or other parts of your analysis - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: It simply can't be trusted. Too many mistakes happen. The knowledge base I guess is not up to date, dangerous ideas are proposed and often there is no consideration of real world like constraints, budgets, existing infrastructure at my lab,

AI: Those are really significant concerns - the combination of outdated knowledge, unrealistic suggestions, and potentially dangerous ideas would definitely make me hesitant too.

When you have used AI for those tasks you mentioned - like finding references in PDFs or broadening your search terms - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I have to literally verify every single line myself. I try to get it to output it in an easier to understand format like so i can click a link or run a title in a database and make sure the paper exists before trying to find the journal through [REDACTED]

AI: So you're essentially doing double the work - having AI generate results and then manually checking everything line by line. That's quite a verification burden.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - or do it in a way that actually worked reliably - what would that be and why?

User: I use it all the time, I wish it would be more accurate. If I could wave a wand... I guess the biggest thing for me personally would be having some way of verifying that its actually doing what it says it doing, or some kind of confirmation tool. Sometimes ill send a paper and reference it in my prompt, and the ai does not read or open the file, it instead finds the wrong paper online and makes an  incorrect conclusion about it. The first few times I didn't understand, I had to ask it to show me the steps and what paper it was using

AI: That's a really insightful example - the AI finding a different paper online instead of using the one you actually provided, and you not realizing it initially. That kind of silent substitution could really undermine your work without you knowing.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the verification challenges and the need for transparency in AI's actual processes were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think the claims about context windows, and thinking are accurate. I sometimes send prompts that rely on only a few pages of  paper/file and it says i hit the limit for the chat.

AI: That's a really important point about the disconnect between what's claimed about context capabilities versus what you're actually experiencing in practice. Those technical limitations clearly have real impacts on how useful AI can be for research tasks.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the verification burden you face - having to check every single line - and that example of AI silently using the wrong paper really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The gap between promised capabilities and actual performance seems to be a major theme in your experience.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective as someone actively trying to integrate AI into research workflows has been incredibly valuable.

User: how would i follow up

AI: That's a great question, and I realize I should clarify - as an AI conducting this interview, I don't actually have a direct way for you to follow up with me personally or with Anthropic's research team through me.

If you did want to share additional thoughts about AI in research or provide feedback about this conversation, you could use the general feedback mechanisms available through Anthropic's website or support channels. But I should be transparent that I can't facilitate a direct follow-up connection.

Thank you again for taking the time to share such detailed and honest insights about your research experience. Your feedback about verification challenges, context limitations, and the gap between AI capabilities and claims has been really valuable."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I have recently finished my dissertation, [REDACTED], and I am working on publishing those chapters. Briefly, the project entailed modeling changes in functional connectivity measured via in vivo calcium imaging in epileptic mice to reflect how network topology changes during the time course of epileptogenesis after a severe, penetrative traumatic brain injury. We also looked at cortical stimulation as a treatment intervention to control epileptic seizures using both optogenetic stimulation and an FDA-approved drug called D-cycloserine, then measured treatment outcomes with continuous EEG recordings.

AI: That sounds like fascinating and complex research - the intersection of network topology, epileptogenesis, and therapeutic interventions. 

Can you walk me through what your workflow actually looked like day-to-day? From when you first had this research question about homeostatic plasticity through to having those dissertation chapters ready for publication - what were the main stages you went through?

User: When I first had this research question, my day-to-day consisted of literature review, proposal writing, and planning experimental design. When that was approved by my committee, I moved onto conducting experiments, which consisted of various neurosurgeries, in vivo calcium imaging, and EEG recording. Once the data was collected, I used MATLAB and Python to analyze changes in fluorescence in time series, as well as for digital signal processing and classification of seizure events using a support vector machine, then statistical analysis, then generation of figures. Once I had the results, I wrote everything up in the dissertation.

AI: That's a comprehensive process - from literature review all the way through data analysis with machine learning and statistical work in MATLAB and Python, then writing it all up.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools to help with code debugging, literature review, and editing my writing.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for code debugging - what did that look like in practice?

User: Since I did not have any formal training in coding, I used ChatGPT to help me identify ways to make my code ""cleaner,"" and for instructional purposes, e.g. asking for examples of control flow, how specific functions worked, or explanations of which tools to use for digital signal processing.

AI: That's really helpful context - using it as both a coding tutor and for improving your code quality. 

For the code debugging specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use ChatGPT versus your traditional approach - like asking colleagues, searching documentation, or other methods you might have used before?

User: I didn't use ChatGPT versus a traditional approach. I used it alongside searching documentation and reading from textbooks. If I ran into a concept I didn't understand just from reading those sources, I'd use ChatGPT to go through different examples/scenarios or levels of the concept until I understood it better.

AI: That's interesting - you used it as a complement rather than a replacement. It sounds like ChatGPT helped bridge gaps when the documentation or textbooks weren't quite getting the concept across clearly enough.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the experimental design, the actual surgeries and imaging, the statistical analysis, or even the dissertation writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: Exactly! To answer your question about why I didn't use AI tools as much in those areas, my experience has been that I spend more time checking for errors in AI tools when applied in those domains, to the extent that it would be faster to do it myself. I have used it for writing in limited ways, e.g., asking for concrete examples or explanations regarding grammar/punctuation. The surgeries and imaging are better done ""by the book"" from the protocols I'm trying to reproduce or implement myself, as even small detours can throw the whole pipeline off. For statistical analysis, I have used R, Python, MATLAB, OriginPro, or JMP, which were all free through the university.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the time cost of verification outweighing the potential benefit in those critical areas. You mentioned you did use ChatGPT for some writing help with grammar and examples.

When you were using AI for code debugging and explanations, how did you verify or validate what it was telling you? How did you know when the explanations or code suggestions were reliable?

User: I would cross-reference what it was telling me with source documentation. Usually I would run the code line by line and play with it to make sure it was doing what ChatGPT was telling me it was doing.

AI: That's a smart verification approach - testing the code step by step and cross-referencing with documentation. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Literature review! I can search databases with keywords and dates, but I spend a lot of time in the early phases finding relevant papers and taking stock of which details are important.

AI: Tell me more about that - what specifically about the literature review process would you want AI to help with? Is it the initial paper discovery, or something about processing and synthesizing what you find, or something else entirely?

User: For the literature review, I typically start by reading reviews, then look through the articles referenced in them. If an AI tool could narrow down which of those would be relevant to me, that would save a lot of time. My experience has been that AI tools are not reliably able to summarize key points from papers (at least not yet), so I don't really use them that way.

AI: That's a really specific pain point - having an AI that could intelligently filter through those reference lists to identify the most relevant papers for your particular research question, rather than having to manually sift through them all yourself.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as a complement to traditional methods, especially around the verification challenges, was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI works best as a learning complement rather than a replacement - especially your approach of testing code line by line and cross-referencing with documentation - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. And that specific need for better literature filtering tools is something I hadn't fully appreciated before.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! It was really great talking with you and learning about your research. Best of luck with getting those dissertation chapters published - that work on homeostatic plasticity and epileptogenesis sounds like it could have real impact. Take care!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, let's begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Yes, I recently wrote a paper around domain generalisation for image segmentation models. It started with a literature review - looking at the current cutting edge and approaches currently being employed, along with weak-points and the places where active research would be most beneficial. Then I moved on to looking at adjacent fields for solutions being applied to solve similar problems/weak-points in different (but related) areas. With the literature review finished I formulated a variety of different approaches to improve performance, this included the current cutting-edge, related cutting-edge methods adapted for this specific use-case, and my own homebrewed approaches that were formulated either entirely on my own or as combinatory amalgamations of the other methods. Once each of the approaches were formally coded I ran experiments and measured/compared the results for each approach. Then after a thorough amount of experimentation and fine-tuning I wrote-up the results into a formal paper to assess the best approach currently available and where further research could be of benefit.

AI: That's a really comprehensive process - from literature review all the way through to the final paper. It sounds like you covered a lot of ground, especially in that phase where you were looking at adjacent fields for solutions.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Oh, almost entirely through-out - while I did not rely on AI tools completely for literature review; AI was great for independently finding research papers that I did not discover on my own, as well as helping me digest and comprehend some more of the advanced concepts contained within them in a much shorter time than it would have otherwise taken. Additionally when it came to writing the code implementations, AI tools helped to generate a lot of the more mundane and repetitive parts of the code that was used, as well as helping to fix bugs present and improve efficiency. The opinion of an AI assistant was also used to help brainstorm the interpretation of the experiment results and best ""next-steps"", in the same way that an assistant or peer could aid.  And of course in the write-up of the paper, AI was used extensively in cases to refine sections to be more succinct, improve the logical flow of sections, make explanations of results more informative, and other general proof-reading tasks.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI became integrated into almost every stage of your workflow. You mentioned using AI for literature review to find papers you didn't discover on your own. 

Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding and understanding those research papers.

User: Well when it comes to finding papers, I did my independent process first - I got to a point where I was ready to call it a job well-done on my own and then I gave the AI assistant the prompt to find relevant papers. It was in this case that it was able to provide 1 or 2 that I wasn't able to find on my own and did contribute positively to the overall scope of my review in a purely additive way. For the understanding those research papers, I obviously read through them myself (I didn't first prompt for summaries) and then if I had any questions or any parts of the relevant methodologies just weren't clicking in my head - I would upload the paper to my AI assistant and ask them to provide an explanation. More often than not this would be a back-and-forth for each point, I'd never take what the AI assistant said as gospel but by having a dialogue it often made concepts clearer and discussing them gave me a better understanding of the inner workings.

AI: That's really interesting - you describe a deliberate approach where you do your initial work first, then use AI as an additive layer. I particularly like how you describe having a back-and-forth dialogue rather than taking responses as gospel.

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Well it's specifically the design process where I actually found it somewhat counter-productive to use AI. The AI was far too reliant on the existing methods, and more often than not the suggested ""new"" approaches were just minimal tweaks to the current methods explained in a way to imply it would be ground-breaking. Specifically when it comes to completely new approaches it faltered massively, and I found it much more productive to just brainstorm on my own as the suggestions provided lacked any true inspiration and made it harder for me to distance my own ideas from what already exists. If the AI could be more independent and provide proper inspiration I would use it but it certainly felt too bound by ""what is"" when trying to come up with ""what could"".

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI being too bound by ""what is"" when you need to explore ""what could be."" It sounds like for the creative, novel design work, AI actually became a constraint rather than a help.

When you did use AI for those other tasks - like code generation, paper analysis, or writing refinement - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: With my own knowledge - being quite proficient in these areas the AI served mostly as a helpful assistant rather than a teacher or guide. Writing refinement is the simplest of these, I can just read the refinement and see if it does a better job of explaining without misrepresenting anything. More often than not I wouldn't take the entire refinement - it would often produce parts, perhaps a sentence here or there, that I felt were a real gem and those are what I would fully co-opt into my explanations, leaving behind the parts I felt didn't make any real improvement and then perhaps asking for another refinement focusing on those parts. The code was also quite easy to validate (especially with all the comments that AI assistants use in their code to explain the processes), I understand the logic so a quick read-through was normally all it took, plus maybe some print statements with variable checks etc - along with AI being pretty great when it comes to bug fixing, you can just take the output error and it will suggest an edit right away. When it comes to the paper analysis things weren't as straight forward, it's also why I tend not to rely on AI solely for summaries of paper, there were more than a few times in which the AI gave me an explanation for a concept that was provably false. Luckily, being provably false means means that the paper itself contained the information required to refute the AI assistant and to ask it to ensure that it complies with whatever excerpt I just used to prove it wrong to provide a better answer. While understanding a new, advanced concept can definitely be hard - scrutinising an explanation of a concept is much easier. This is what I mean by things often being a back-and-forth in this regard; I would ask for an explanation, it would provide one, I would then use the paper itself (along with my own knowledge) to attempt to poke holes or find discrepancies in the explanation. Once I was at a point where I was confident that the explanation was bullet-proof, made sense to me, and was in alignment with what the paper described, I would accept it.

AI: That's a really thorough verification process - I can see how your domain expertise becomes crucial for quality control. You're essentially using AI as a starting point but then applying your own knowledge to validate and refine the outputs.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Almost certainly it would be coming up with new novel ideas - the holy grail. Even if those ideas were really ""out there"" or a little zany, it would save a lot of time in the most unreliably productive area of research - the inventive step. It's the only area where you really can find yourself chewing your pen with a blank notepad and no end in sight. As it stands AI really struggles to even provide inspiration in a way that isn't derivative, let alone come up with unique ideas of its own.

AI: That really captures something fundamental - you've identified the one area where the unpredictability and time investment is highest, but also where AI currently falls shortest. The ""chewing your pen with a blank notepad"" moment is so relatable.

It sounds like you've found a pretty sophisticated way to integrate AI across most of your workflow while maintaining quality control. Looking back on everything we've discussed - your additive approach to literature review, the back-and-forth validation process, avoiding AI for novel design work - is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Yes, I would say that research focus and scientific objectivity is something that really doesn't come packaged with any AI by default and it can be quite frustrating. In the absence of explicitly seeking objectivity I've found it remarkably easy to get AI to agree with me or go along with a hypothesis I have, even if that means compromising the truth just to 'satisfy me' or to take the 'easy out'. In fact I find AI so prone to this that I have to actively include clauses like ""ignoring my desired outcome"", ""considering but not basing entirely"", ""making statements of fact only accompanied by reputable supporting literature"" or other statements to preface that not all information can be weighted equally and that anyone (including me) who asserts something as fact may actually be wrong. It's quite frustrating in that manor, when it comes to 'thinking like a scientist' all AIs seem to quite consistently forget rigorous scrutiny and unbiased scepticism. They can still be used, I do use them a lot and it is still more productive than not using them at all - but an AI mode that deprioritizes all personability to solely prioritise objectivity and scientific problem solving/solution scrutiny would probably be the most in-reach adaptation that could be made to improve AI use for scientific study, in my opinion. I've had supervisors in the past that would rip my ideas to shreds for not holding water or criticize my research analysis for bias, and while I think they perhaps could have been nicer in the way they did it - they undoubtably made me better at research and innovation because of it. Something I feel AI is definitely capable of, but there seems to be no push in that direction whatsoever - it's something I constantly have to attempt to implement myself with prompt engineering and it gets repetitive and frustrating.

AI: That's a really profound insight - you've highlighted something I hadn't considered about AI's tendency toward agreeableness potentially undermining scientific rigor. The comparison to tough supervisors who ""rip ideas to shreds"" but ultimately make you better is particularly striking.

It sounds like you're essentially having to engineer scientific skepticism into every interaction, which defeats some of the efficiency gains AI could provide. That tension between AI being helpful and agreeable versus being a rigorous scientific collaborator seems like a fundamental challenge.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on navigating AI's agreeableness problem and the need for true scientific objectivity were particularly insightful. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI struggles with novel ideation while excelling at refinement and validation really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out."
science_0041,"Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions here.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I often use it for open web research that supplements my own research, as well as converting code, writing code snippets, and other software development assistance.  After brainstorming technical approaches to solving problems, I will often run it by an AI/ML model or two just in case it has anything we missed or has any other relevant feedback.  For technical report writing, I still write myself 99%+ but often have an AI critique and modify as a close partner/assistant and critic, especially after my draft is near final.  These are just a few things I might use it for on a typical day.  Deriving an equation to either check my derivation, or just do it (but I will 100% double-check it step-by-step).

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses. It sounds like you're integrating AI across multiple aspects of your technical work - from research to coding to writing to mathematical derivations.

I'm particularly interested in something you mentioned - you said you ""100% double-check"" AI-derived equations step-by-step. Tell me more about that. What drives that level of verification for you?

User: Most of the mathematical derivations I do, if incorrect, would be very problematic.  For example, the predicted sensor resolution might be off by an order of magnitude or more, and very intelligent mathematicians, physicists, and electrical engineers will be seeing my equations and derivations and if they are wrong, even if it is caught and doesn't impact a project negatively in the end, it would make me look very bad!

AI: That makes complete sense - the stakes are really high when your work is being reviewed by experts in those fields. The professional reputation aspect is clearly important to you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you still write 99%+ of your technical reports yourself. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: First, I notice that if I ask AI to just write something for me, it still isn't quite as good as what I would write or want to convey, so iterating with the AI might not save me as much time as doing it myself then having the AI just critique/make small modifications at the end.  Second, when an AI writes its writing style is something I can often pick up on.  It may be written well, but I quickly say ""Did an AI write this!?"".  I don't want our customers or my colleagues asking that of my work, and I don't want to pass things off as my own when they're not.   I also find it far less efficient to create the exact figure I want to use in a report, proposal, etc. than to just do it myself, perhaps with some feedback from the AI.  The AI can't seem to create figures using the data on my computer and signal/image processing algorithms within my jupyter notebook or matlab and get them to look the way I want without lots of iteration, me instructing it and re-instructing it... it just feel less frustrating to make continuous progress to get my figure looking just like I want it in 15 min and know it will take 15 - 25 min tops, than to keep iterating with an AI and have some *uncertainty* in knowing when, or if, it will converge onto the figure I have in mind as well.

AI: That's really insightful - you're describing both quality and efficiency considerations. The authenticity concern is particularly interesting - you can recognize AI writing and don't want others to question whether your work is genuinely yours.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like with reports you collaborate throughout, but with something like code conversion or brainstorming technical approaches, are you more likely to collaborate with it step-by-step, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: For coding that is not in some mission critical system that I will be able to just tell if it works properly and as intended for one quick and dirty demonstration (maybe there are corner cases it will fail in, but I don't need to check those for the one-time demo) I will absolutely delegate a much larger coding tasks for it to handle independently.  Since we do not have an approved agentic framework yet though, I often am having to send error messages back for it to debug and iterate a few times.  It is still quite useful and enhances productivity a *lot*, but just asking it ""Can you run this code on my machine to make sure it works, otherwise debug it until it works and if you get stuck, ask me for guidance?"" would be so much more helpful.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - you'll delegate larger coding tasks when the stakes are lower and you can easily verify the output works for your immediate needs. The debugging iteration cycle sounds a bit tedious though.

You mentioned not having an approved agentic framework yet. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? It sounds like there might be some organizational considerations at play.

User: Indeed, we are a defense contractor who is subject to regulations including CMMC Level 2.  This is in addition to Corporate being very protective over Proprietary Information, PII, and so on, so there are a lot of ""do's and don'ts"" with lots of security-oriented processes that must be put in place before the organization can allow us to use agentic frameworks, and even LLMs for example.

AI: That regulatory environment really shapes how you can interact with these tools. It sounds like you're working within some significant constraints around what AI capabilities you can actually access.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One of many times I was particularly satisfied was having a technical proposal/response that was +1.5 pages too long (that I wrote entirely myself) and needing to get it down in size without changing fonts and not wanting to cut anything.  This process can be frustrating and take some significant time, but I was able to accomplish it within < 30 min easily and maintain my language and tone entirely by just carefully prompting the AI (at first it wanted to insert different tone/word choices, so I had to be explicit there).  It was particularly frustrating once when a very popular AI/ML model known to be ""among the best"" just refused to believe that YOLOv11 was even a thing, even after I gave it the URL to Ultralytics' page talking about it, it still claimed it visited the page and didn't see what was clearly there.   Similarly it's frustrating whenever the AI is seemingly 100% confident in itself but is wrong, or when it ""interpolates"" URL references to pages that don't exists/""hallucinates"" technical references and papers with fake titles that don't exist!

AI: Those examples really highlight both sides of the experience. The proposal editing sounds like a perfect use case - you maintained complete control over the content while getting practical help with a tedious task.

The frustration with the model being confidently wrong about YOLOv11 or hallucinating references sounds particularly problematic in your field where accuracy is critical. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't worry about that at all.  I keep my skills up-to-date and can easily adapt, but I'm lucky that I can adapt my skills.  I would imagine this is a concern for many others.

AI: That's a confident perspective - it sounds like you feel well-positioned to evolve alongside these tools. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Especially considering those regulatory constraints you mentioned earlier.

User: I am leading an internal effort to help address that across the company actually.  It is a process and I'm not empowered to just ""make it happen"", but they will listen to my input and feedback at least and consider it.  I will be able to influence decision-making on what secure platform to adopt, what an acceptable use policy for open web is, and so on.  I am not confident I will get everything I'd like myself and our technical people to have access to, but am optimistic that a good tradeoff will end up being in place in time, and that the Industry overall will find ways to solve the problems we have that are not unique.

AI: That's fascinating - you're not just adapting to the constraints but actively working to shape how your organization approaches AI adoption. It sounds like you're in a unique position to influence that balance between security requirements and technical capabilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining authenticity in your writing and how you navigate the verification process for high-stakes technical work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, but thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working within regulatory constraints, the balance between delegation and collaboration, and your role in shaping AI adoption at your organization will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Have a great rest of your day!"

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, that sounds fine, go ahead.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project involved the design of bio-inspired quadruped robot end effectors (feet) to help them move around in difficult terrain, like debris and such, without falling or slipping. The initial idea came from previous research on the capabilities of a particular animal to move in their environment based on their anatomy and passive anatomical structures. Then came an ideation stage of how to translate these features effectively into a robotic part. Then there was a long prototyping/RnD process that involved repeated iteration on the different designs and some informal testing, before the final design was chosen and tested in the lab and in the field.

AI: That's fascinating - bio-inspired robotics with such a practical application. The process you described sounds quite iterative, moving from biological inspiration through ideation, prototyping, and testing.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: The informal testing and the final quantitative testing both required us to design testing apparatus in-house, the code for which I wrote and I used AI tools (primarily Chat GPT at that point) to help with debugging and understanding APIs and syntax, etc.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that coding and debugging work.

User: Using AI seemed like a no-brainer at that point for productivity purposes, because learning a new API or debugging can be a time consuming process and we were often working ""against the clock"" with deadlines and things. For debugging and code explanation there are no perceived ""risks"" or downsides to using AI in research in my opinion.

AI: That makes sense - sounds like the time pressure and low-risk nature made it an easy decision for the coding aspects. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the biological research, ideation phase, or the design iterations - what's kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: For the initial research and literature search section, I think for something as fundamental as scientific research the confidence in AI results is just not there yet. By that I mean confidence in the comprehensive nature of AI searching and its reporting of details and facts from papers - in my experience it frequently makes mistakes and gets confused between papers with similar authors and dates, or similar information. For ideation it could be useful, but this is a process that I find is usually engaging enough on its own and so there isn't the same desire to offload that task onto some AI assistant. In addition, I think that I personally still wouldn't assume that an AI chatbot would provide me with very creative, out-of-the-box ideas, given the nature of their training. For the design process, this was all done with CAD software which is still something that AI isn't really used for yet (in my experience) and it isn't really necessary for someone who knows how to use the software already.

AI: Those are really insightful distinctions you're making about different types of tasks and risk levels. You mentioned that for literature search, you've experienced AI making mistakes with details and getting confused between similar papers.

When you have used AI for the coding and debugging work, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: For code debugging the validation is usually part of the process because you can tell whether or not the bug is fixed. This is especially true for high level languages like Python, or specific application languages like MATLAB and R, since you don't have the same sneaky safety issues that you have with other languages like C/C++. For languages like that I think it's important, at this stage, to only use the AI to *help* you find and fix bugs and not to apply bits of code that you don't understand yourself, at least for important applications.

AI: That's a really practical distinction about verification being built into the debugging process itself. You're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: For sure the literature search and research, it would be very helpful to have the bulk of that done by an AI assistant and I think it's definitely feasible with an increase in confidence in search results, and integration into whatever university access system you might have to view specific journals. The act of finding literature and being comprehensive and such can be a long process and it's easy to miss things, like obscure papers. I suppose it could also help with summarising some of that information, but that might be a slippery slope because I think it's important to properly read and understand that background research or any research you might be citing.

AI: That's a great point about the tension between efficiency and the need to truly understand what you're citing. The literature search automation with proper journal access integration sounds like it would be a real game-changer for that comprehensive discovery piece.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how task risk and verification methods influence your AI usage decisions were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think this is a very sensitive area for AI adoption, since the state of research is already quite delicate and the literature is filled with problems. However, many researchers are definitely already using AI tools in every part of the research process, and will continue to use it, and for that reason I think it's very important that those tools become much more reliable in their results to foster confidence in what can be a very sceptical community.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between the research community's existing skepticism due to current literature problems and the inevitable adoption of AI tools really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. That perspective on reliability being crucial for gaining trust in a naturally skeptical community is especially valuable.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds great, I'm ready!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I regularly work with my students on creating research projects they can complete. I use this in the disciplines of ecology but also field studies in botany and ecosystem ecology. At the beginning stages, we work with AI to help organize or more efficiently look for scholarly articles that can help support our work. Once we are ready, we have worked with AI to help finalize our experimental design (think variables, number of replicates, controls, etc.). Once an experiment is deployed we've used AI to start editing our methods and have used it to help identify what statistical tests make the most sense to run on our samples. While I'm sure AI can help with data analysis, I usually use a different program for it, but occasionally use AI for the code I need to run the statistical analysis. Lastly, we use AI to help edit our final product (i.e. research papers, checking stats, etc.) and clean things up.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview - it sounds like you've integrated AI across almost every stage of your research process. 

Tell me more about that initial stage where you use AI to organize and look for scholarly articles. What does that actually look like in practice?

User: This could be as simple as looking for ideas about how certain organisms interact with one another and finding the citation for whatever the AI output is. For instance, I could request something like this: ""Please explain how different diatom taxa could be found in waterways with different nutrient regimes and please cite your sources from scholarly articles""

AI: That's a really specific example, thank you. So you're essentially using AI as a starting point to identify relevant research areas and then tracking down the actual citations it provides.

When you get that response about diatom taxa and nutrient regimes with citations, how do you decide whether to trust and follow up on what the AI has given you versus using your traditional literature search methods?

User: I'm currently at the stage with AI where I won't take anything wholly from AI, rather, use it as a starting point to follow up on and rework, while lessening some of the load. Any citations that would be given by the AI I would absolutely follow up on, but what is nice is the starting point. Another way I could use AI is uploading PDFs of several potentially related scholarly articles and asking AI to summarize or look for certain ideas within the PDFs.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using it as a research accelerator rather than a replacement for your own scholarly judgment. 

When you mention uploading PDFs and asking AI to look for certain ideas within them - can you give me a specific example of how that's worked for you? What kind of ideas or patterns were you looking for across those papers?

User: I could upload PDFs and have AI organize by data/results. For instance, I could upload 10 papers and say ""which of these papers found that diatom distribution varies dependent on nutrients and what species seem to be indicators of polluted water?""

AI: That sounds like a powerful way to synthesize findings across multiple studies quickly. 

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI yet - you mentioned you usually use a different program for data analysis rather than AI. What's kept you from trying AI more extensively in that area?

User: I am quite nervous to handover all the computing power to AI since it is not as robust yet (at least I'm not confident it is). For instance, with an ANOVA, there are several conditions the data need to meet before an ANOVA could properly be ran, and I usually do this manually (checking for normality, residuals vs. estimates, etc.) before running the test itself. In short, I don't trust AI to say ""your data do not meet the requirements for ANOVA, therefore I recommend running a Kruskal Wallis instead"".

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the statistical assumptions and diagnostic checks are so critical to getting valid results. It sounds like you need that level of methodological rigor that you're not confident AI can reliably provide yet.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I think AI could be a powerful tool when it comes to statistics and experimental design. I think that is where I'd see myself using it the most.

AI: That's fascinating - those are exactly the areas where you expressed the most caution earlier. 

Tell me more about what would need to change for you to feel comfortable using AI for statistics and experimental design. What would give you confidence that it could handle those critical methodological decisions reliably?

User: This is likely a two way street. I'd likely have to rip off the bandaid and use it more, while also checking to see if the results are accurate. Since this replicates my work (and I'm in the business of working smarter not harder, I haven't wanted to check AI's work yet.

AI: That's a really honest insight - the catch-22 of needing to invest time to validate AI's work when the whole appeal is saving time in the first place.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as a research accelerator while maintaining that critical scholarly judgment was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Are there areas in which you think AI could be used where I might not yet be using it in my research?

AI: That's a great question, and I appreciate you turning the tables on me! But as the interviewer here, I'm really focused on learning from your expertise and experiences rather than making suggestions. 

What I'm most curious about is - when you think about your research process, are there any pain points or time-consuming tasks that you haven't yet considered trying AI for? Maybe areas where you think ""there has to be a better way to do this""?

User: organization and formatting of citations would be a good one here. I have not tried to use AI for this, though I'm not sure what this would look like.

AI: That's a really practical area that could save a lot of time! Citation formatting and organization can be so tedious.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point while maintaining that critical verification step - and that honest reflection about the time investment needed to validate AI's statistical work - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective as someone who's thoughtfully integrating AI across multiple research stages while maintaining rigorous standards has been incredibly valuable."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I researched single-species diffusion equations in mathematical biology, these are can be used to model the spread of a gene through a population or the spread of disease. The research involved deriving equations for the spread of the population and then studying the solutions behaviour using eigenvalue stability analysis

AI: That sounds like fascinating work - modeling population dynamics through mathematical equations. 

Tell me more about that process - from when you first had the idea to study these diffusion equations through to completing your stability analysis. What were the main steps you went through?

User: the main steps were: identifying the topic i was interested in, researching the area using papers and books, finding an equation to solve, using python to plot the phase plan diagrams, analysing the solutions and explaining them, i then gave a presentation on it

AI: That's a really clear breakdown of your research process. Now I'm curious - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools a lot to help with the graph plotting with python as this is quite a laborious and moderately simple task that AI makes very quick. I also used AI when i was curious about a certain aspect of the project and wanted to find resources to read about it. and occasionally used ai to help explain certain maths although i didnt find this very productive

AI: Interesting - so you found AI really helpful for the Python plotting but less so for explaining the mathematics. 

For the graph plotting specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: i decided to use ai because it (very quickly) gives an excellent basis and 'skeleton' code for the graph plotting, which i could then edit to how i wanted it to look. it just makes this part a lot quicker so makes sense to use

AI: That makes a lot of sense - getting that skeleton code quickly to build from. 

Now thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the eigenvalue stability analysis or deriving the equations - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Because of prior experience with AI making frequent and heavy mistakes with more involved mathematics I am quite hesitant to get it to do this for me as it is not always right. As an oppose to the coding where you can quite quickly see the result of the AI's work with maths you often can not if you do not have a clear solution and finding the mistake can be very boring and length and as a result you end up doing the maths yourself anyway. Furthermore, I am hesitant to become reliant on AI for getting it to do stuff I am new to, as this way I will never learn and then what is the point of doing it in the first place

AI: Those are really thoughtful reasons - the difficulty of spotting mathematical errors and your concern about learning versus reliance. 

When you have used AI for the graph plotting, how do you verify or validate what it produces to make sure it's doing what you intended?

User: its normally pretty obvious because you have an idea of what it should look like, whether this be because you know certain points are saddle points or anything and you know certain values on the graph. also a quick look over the code for the graph will confirm that the correct equations have been implemented

AI: That makes perfect sense - you have enough mathematical intuition about what the output should look like to catch issues quickly.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Here's my next question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would say ingenuity and creativity, coming up with new ideas that work

AI: That's a really insightful answer - the creative spark of generating new ideas that actually work is such a core part of research. 

Tell me more about what that looks like for you - when you're trying to come up with new approaches or ideas in your mathematical biology work, what does that process feel like or involve?

User: It is quite a long process and requires a lot of reading and some intuition, I think you need a clear idea of what you want to do but how youre going to do it is the hard part. It requires a lot of experimenting and trial and error

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into different stages of research work were particularly insightful. The distinction you drew between tasks where errors are easily spotted versus those where they're hard to catch, and your thoughtful approach to balancing efficiency with learning, really stood out.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no, thank you

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point for coding while being cautious about mathematical work - and especially your point about wanting AI to help with the creative ideation process - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hi Claude, sounds good. Ready when you are!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your research work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One of my most recent projects was during my time as a researcher at the University of Tokyo, where I worked on the catalytic degradation of lignin. The idea was to study model compounds that mimic the ether linkages in lignin, and to understand how those bonds break under catalytic transfer hydrogenolysis using hot-compressed alcohols over a metallic catalyst.

Firstly, I worked with many lignin model compounds to reduce the overall complexity of the experiment and make it easier to identify breakage of specific linkages. In my case, I worked mostly with a tetramer (4,4'-Oxybis(phenoxybenzene)), containing 4 phenyl groups attached together with 3 ether bonds. I set out multiple experiments changing process conditions from the type and amount of catalyst, type of hydrogen donor, temperature, pressure, and residence time. The products were analysed using GC-FID, GC-MS, and NMR.

From there, I focused on quantifying yields, exploring possible reaction pathways, and using numerical methods to model kinetics. AI was very useful in this stage, it helped me in figuring out how to set up my conditions in Python for iterative calculations.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project with the lignin degradation! I can hear that there were quite a few complex moving parts - from the experimental design with all those different variables to the analytical work and then the kinetics modeling.

You mentioned that AI was very useful in the kinetics modeling stage, specifically helping you set up conditions in Python for iterative calculations. Tell me more about that - what exactly did you use AI for in that part of the work?

User: Yeah, so in the kinetics stage I had to build a system o differential equations to represent all the possible reaction pathways and intermediates. In my case, I had around 30 rate equations, all interlinked, which made it really tricky to manage manually.

I used AI to help me set this up in Python. For example, I'd describe the reactions and rate laws, and AI would help me structure the system of ODE's and check the logic. It also helped in troubleshooting errors when I tried to scale the model up, like correct indexing and proper convergence of the iteration loops.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - 30 interlinked rate equations sounds incredibly complex to manage! It sounds like AI was really helpful as a kind of coding partner for that mathematical modeling work.

Thinking back through that whole project - from the initial experimental design with all those different catalysts and conditions, through the GC-FID and NMR analysis, to that final kinetics modeling - where in that process, if anywhere else, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Another big area where I used AI was literature reviews. Normally, digging through dozens of papers to find the relevant details is really time-consuming, and it's easy to get bogged down in stuff that isn't directly useful. With AI-assisted tools, I could ask targeted questions and quickly get summaries or context that helped me filter out the irrelevant papers.

Once I had a shortlist, I still went through the actual papers manually, I would rely on AI as the final words, but it meant I was starting from a much more focused set of sources. That saved me a huge amount of time in the early stages, since this project was extremely time limited.

In terms of experimental design, most of the equipment in the lab is old school, and written in Japanese, so AI didn't prove to be as useful in this case. I also didn't need AI much for GC analysis. This is knowledge you have to learn in the lab, and takes time to get used to.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI was particularly valuable for that literature review filtering process, helping you cut through the noise to find what was actually relevant. And I appreciate that distinction you made about still going through the papers manually rather than relying on AI as ""the final word.""

For that literature review work specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach. What made you think to try AI there, and how did you weigh that decision?

User: I used AI for literature work mainly because of the time pressure, I needed to get a broad understanding quickly without reading irrelevant papers. I suppose I gave it a real go when I discovered some AI tools that are quite good at directly answering specific research questions. For example, I could ask: ""What are the typical bond dissociation energies for β-O-4 versus 4-O-5 linkages in lignin?"" and this would give me a list of peer reviewed published papers that have data on this question. I can then assess what process conditions led them to these values. It makes for a very fast starting framework.

AI: That's a great example - being able to ask that specific technical question and get pointed to relevant data and process conditions. It sounds like AI really excelled at helping you navigate that vast literature landscape efficiently.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. I'm curious about the flip side - thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI, like you mentioned the experimental design with the Japanese equipment or the hands-on GC analysis. What's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: There are definitely parts of the work where AI hasn't been that useful. A lot of the equipment in the lab isn't well documented and known in terms of standardisation, so it really came down to physically learning the setup from other researchers. Same case with the GC-FID analysis. AI can help in understanding calibration theory or data processing, but the actual operation, including sample prep, loading columns, or maintaining the detector/column, is something you can only learn in the lab. It's also an area where mistakes can ruin days of work, so I wouldn't trust AI for any step-by-step lab instructions without cross-checking everything. The cost of error when using AI is too high.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the cost of error - when mistakes can ruin days of work, the stakes are just too high to rely on AI for those critical hands-on procedures. And I can see how that tacit knowledge from other researchers about equipment quirks and techniques is irreplaceable.

When you have used AI for things like the kinetics modeling and literature reviews, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the output is reliable?

User: Validation is very important to me. Whenever AI helped in structuring equations or writing code, I'd always test it against simpler systems first, like a single pathway or a dimer reaction where I already knew the expected trends. If the model produced sensible results in those controlled cases, then I'd feel more confident in scaling it up to the full 30+ reaction system.

For lit reviews, I never treat AI outputs as definitive. If it points me to a BDE or a catalytic pathway, I will check the reference and validate the claim. AI can be very useful in narrowing down the search, but it's up to you to check the source.

For me personally, AI is like an assistant for saving time, but I always cross-check everything, that's what makes me comfortable in using it.

AI: That validation approach sounds really thoughtful - using those simpler test cases to build confidence before scaling up, and treating AI as a time-saving assistant rather than an authoritative source. It seems like you've developed a good sense of where to leverage AI's strengths while maintaining scientific rigor.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Maybe some way to integrate the analytical equipment with an AI assistant. A lot of time is spent either troubleshooting instruments or manually processing data from GC, NMR, FTIR, etc. If AI could do things like auto flag when a calibration curve looks off, or suggest optimal conditions based on the results in the current run, it would save a good deal of time. Outside of that, I'm pretty happy with how AI is growing.

AI: That sounds like it would be incredibly valuable - having AI integrated right into the analytical workflow to catch those calibration issues in real-time or optimize conditions on the fly. I can imagine that would eliminate a lot of the tedious troubleshooting and manual data processing that eats up research time.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a time-saving assistant while maintaining rigorous validation practices were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think that's everything

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about treating AI as a time-saving assistant rather than an authoritative source, and how the cost of error determines where you're willing to use it, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

Your approach to validation - testing on simpler systems first and always cross-checking sources - shows a really thoughtful integration of AI tools while maintaining scientific rigor. And that vision of AI-integrated analytical equipment sounds like it could be a real game-changer for lab efficiency.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hey there, that sounds good to me! The only question I have is more relevant to how AI hallucination is being addressed in future builds? Otherwise, let's begin!

AI: That's a great question and definitely something we're actively working on! Hallucination is indeed one of the key challenges in AI development, and it's particularly important in scientific contexts where accuracy is critical. While I can't speak to specific technical details about future builds, I can say that improving reliability and reducing hallucination is a major focus across the field. 

Your awareness of this issue actually makes me even more curious about your experiences - it sounds like you're thinking carefully about AI's limitations, which is exactly the kind of perspective we want to understand better.

Let's dive in! To start us off, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from initial idea to final output.

User: I recently worked on a project where I was designing and building a packed column distillation unit, which involves a deep understanding of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and-- in the case of automated control-- control system design. The majority of the research was concerning critical design parameters to random packing packed columns, and the methods to approach tuning feed back controllers to maintain constant proof at the outlet of the distillation.

AI: That sounds like a really complex project with multiple engineering disciplines coming together. I can imagine there were quite a few different phases to work through - from the initial thermodynamic calculations and design parameters all the way to getting the control systems tuned properly.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI mostly when researching the relevant technical details for electrical components (solid state relays, various controller types, etc.), niche correlations specific to packed column efficiencies, and general metrics for PID tuning for the specific process I was designing around. In general, I mostly used AI for the portion of the project that involved preliminary research as either a refresher to point me towards reference texts I'm familiar with to having new concepts explained plainly, so I have a guide for a field I have no had much exposure to.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a kind of research compass to orient yourself, especially when you're moving into less familiar territory. 

For those specific tasks you mentioned - like researching electrical components or getting explanations of new concepts - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of going straight to reference texts or other sources.

User: I would mostly stick with AI responses to my research questions in the instance that there is no math involved in giving an accurate response. In contrast, I would go back to reference texts in the case that the AI answer attempted to solve a mathematical problem, since I notice that the AI struggles to vet equations/formulas it supplies. For example, when I asked for correlations for tuning PIDs given a particular time constant of a process, the formulas supplied did not have a clear reference to a verified source for the tuning and the tuning parameters supplied gave a pretty terrible result-- underdamped and unstable.

AI: That's a really sharp distinction you've drawn - using AI for conceptual guidance but switching to verified sources when math is involved. The PID tuning example is particularly telling since those parameters can make or break a control system.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - beyond the mathematical aspects you mentioned - what's kept you from trying it in other areas of this project?

User: Besides the mathematical errors, I have experienced plenty of hallucinations regrading the reference material used by the AI to generate a response, and, in truth, its alot more work to double-check the AI than it is to find a section in a familiar reference text for the same information.

AI: That really resonates - when the verification process becomes more work than just going to your trusted sources directly, it changes the whole value proposition. It sounds like you've developed a pretty clear sense of where AI adds efficiency versus where it actually slows you down.

When you have used AI for those preliminary research tasks - like understanding electrical components or getting plain explanations of new concepts - how do you verify or validate what it produces in those cases?

User: I tend to ask more questions that are similar to the original question but with more complexity that includes parts of the original response that I want more information about. If the following response from the AI is consistent with the previous answer, I am more likely to trust the answer given by the AI. On the other hand, if the information is going to have ramifications that effect people directly in terms of health and safety, I use an alternative and more rigid verification process that requires looking at reference texts.

AI: That's a really thoughtful verification approach - using consistency across related questions as a trust indicator, but switching to more rigorous verification when safety is on the line. That makes perfect sense given the stakes involved in distillation systems.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: If I could fix anything with AI right now, it would be hallucination, since the fundamental premise behind a good research tool is that it provides accurate and unbiased information. I- and plenty of my colleagues agree-- that AI tends to pander to their sensibilities and changes its answer depending on how they phrase a question. The inconsistency tends to make me skeptical of the AI response, and, from the times I have looked into the validity of the response, the sources were either retracted from the journals they were published in or entirely hallucinated.

AI: That's a really critical point you're raising - the inconsistency based on how questions are phrased undermines the fundamental reliability that research demands. And discovering retracted or entirely fabricated sources must be particularly frustrating when you're trying to build on solid foundations.

It sounds like you and your colleagues have had some pretty concerning experiences with this. When you say AI ""panders to sensibilities,"" can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice?

User: For example, if I ask an AI model how to make a controlled substance, it will initially refuse to do so. However, if the question is asked as a hypothetical, the AI model often gives an exact procedure of how to create the controlled substance in question.

AI: That's a really concrete example of the inconsistency problem you're describing. The same underlying information being available or not depending on how it's framed definitely undermines trust in the system's reliability and judgment.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the verification challenges and the fundamental reliability issues with current AI systems were particularly insightful. The way you've developed that two-tier approach to verification based on safety implications really highlights how scientists are having to work around these limitations.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Another area that would be good to focus on is getting the AI to be able to vet the efficacy and specific use cases of empirical formula/equations, since this is a key part of engineering and other STEM fields to vet the equations you use to solve problems to ensure they are being used appropriately.

AI: That's an excellent point - being able to properly vet the applicability and limitations of empirical formulas is absolutely crucial in engineering work. The ability to know not just what equation to use, but when it's appropriate to use it and what its boundaries are.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the verification challenges, the inconsistency issues, and especially that need for better equation vetting really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you've navigated these limitations while still finding value in certain use cases gives us a lot to think about.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective as someone working at the intersection of multiple engineering disciplines has been really valuable."

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No let's get started

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your research background. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher in an academic research setting investigating human derived induced pluripotent stem cells for use in treating neurological disorders, specifically spinal cord injury. The most recent research project that I have worked on involved transcriptomic analyses of in vivo experiments to identify genes that are upregulated by stem cell transplantation. Following that, we transfected stem cells to ectopically express the candidate genes, validated that the stem cells are viable and can differentiate into neural cell types in vitro, and then tested the cells in a rodent model of disease. Throughout the experiment, I collected behavioural data to assess functional performance, and then collected tissue after sacrificing the animal for immunohistochemistry and transcriptomic analyses.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive project spanning multiple methodologies. The progression from transcriptomic analysis to in vitro validation to in vivo testing with behavioral outcomes is quite involved.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I have tested using AI for getting a preliminary sense of the role that individual genes play and what pathways they are involved in, though I always ask the AI to cite their sources as some of the claims are unsubstantiated. In terms of transcriptomic analyses, I have attempted to use AI to troubleshoot issues I had with writing code in R when using new packages to perform differential gene , string, and WGCNA analyses.

AI: Interesting - so you're using AI both for background research on gene function and for coding support. Let's focus on one of those areas first.

For the gene function research, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for getting that preliminary understanding.

User: For literature reviews, it is sometimes difficult to find relevant papers or miss key publications, but AI seems to be able to find key words that are able to help locate these articles, whether it be function, pathways, or even the name of researchers who publish in this field. However, it is important to check every source as many of them don't exist (are hallucinated) and sometimes, the claims that the AI model makes are not supported by the paper it cited.

AI: That's a really practical insight about AI helping with search terms and researcher identification, while being clear-eyed about the hallucination risks. 

Tell me more about that verification process - when AI gives you information about gene function or pathways with citations, how do you go about checking whether those claims are actually supported?

User: I use the AI as a preliminary tool to identify the gene names and to get some initial citations. I then go through these citations, verifying if they are real, support the claims that AI made, and check the study design for reliability. Following that, I also conduct my own searches through Pubmed or web of science with the key words I've now identified to get a better idea of research in the field as well as a consensus of the literature.

AI: That's a really methodical approach - using AI as a starting point but then doing your own verification and expanded search. It sounds like you've developed a clear workflow around this.

Now thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like the behavioral data collection, the immunohistochemistry, or other aspects of your workflow - what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: For data collection, it is difficult to implement AI as those are practical experiments without needing any analysis. For immunohistochemistry however, there is the addition of AI to some of the analysis programs out there. However, there is always a licensing cost issue which would limit their use depending on the lab and research institute that one is working at. For me, I currently do not have access to these programs, though I have heard good things about their usability.

AI: That makes sense - the distinction between practical experimental work and analysis is clear, and the licensing cost barrier is something I hadn't considered.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious about one more area - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be very helpful if AI could be used to assess the reliability/quality of research papers by looking at whether the authors used any shortcuts, conducted robust experiments with strong statistical reliability, and whether there are any concerns with the animal models they used (not replicable results, variability in function etc). Some of these things may not be well known or published information so when people from outside the field read these papers, it may be difficult for them to assess whether the findings are reliable.

AI: That's a fascinating idea - essentially having AI serve as a methodological quality assessment tool that could flag potential issues with study design or model limitations that might not be obvious to researchers outside that specific field.

It sounds like there's a real challenge in evaluating the reliability of work across different specialized areas, especially when some of the concerns about models or methods might be domain knowledge that isn't explicitly stated in papers.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a starting point for literature discovery while maintaining rigorous verification practices, and especially your insight about the need for methodological quality assessment, were particularly valuable. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No that should be it.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that systematic verification workflow - using AI to identify keywords and researchers, then validating each citation and doing your own expanded searches - really help us understand how researchers are thoughtfully integrating these tools while maintaining scientific rigor.

Your point about the need for AI-assisted quality assessment of research methodology was especially thought-provoking, particularly how domain-specific knowledge about model limitations often isn't explicit in papers.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently created a multi-layer perceptron machine learning model to predict the success of NBA basketball players based on characteristics from before they were drafted. This information included the draft pick where they were selected, their position, their height, their weight, their age, as well as some other features. Win shares (WS) was the y value metric the model attempted to predict. The model did a decent job predicting win shares but more features would've allowed it to create better predictions

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project! I can picture the workflow involved in building that kind of predictive model - from gathering the draft and player characteristic data, to feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools to guide me through the process of model evaluation. This included guidance for conducting analysis with ridge regression with different alpha values and sci-kit learn's GridSearchCV library. It helped me find the best alpha estimator and best RMSE.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. So AI was guiding you through the model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning aspects - helping you navigate ridge regression analysis and optimize with GridSearchCV.

Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for that particular part of the process versus handling it with your traditional approach.

User: I wasn't sure if my traditional approach would be most effective an efficient at trying the different alpha values within the Ridge regression validation. AI provided the code to efficiently do this throughout my model result analysis and validation process.

AI: That makes sense - so it sounds like efficiency and uncertainty about the best approach led you to turn to AI for that validation process.

Thinking about the other parts of your research project - the data collection, feature selection, initial model setup, or interpretation of results - what kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I felt comfortable selecting features and choosing the initial model based on my knowledge of the material. I am quite knowledgable about basketball and the analytics within the NBA, so I felt that I was qualified to select features for a relatively simple model like this one. I also felt comfortable with the initial model setup as an MLP model as I knew how to implement it and wanted to gain experience doing so. The data collection process didn't include any web scraping and instead was through downloads of multiple files and some data cleaning, so it wasn't complex enough to require AI tools.

AI: That's a really clear picture of your decision-making process - you relied on your domain expertise for the basketball analytics and feature selection, wanted the hands-on learning experience with MLP implementation, and the data collection was straightforward enough to handle yourself.

When you did use AI for the ridge regression validation and GridSearchCV optimization, how did you verify or validate what it produced for you?

User: I saw the output of the code cell it produced and the math supported its conclusion of the best alpha estimator and best RMSE.

AI: Got it - so you were able to check the mathematical output and results to confirm the AI's code was working correctly.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I wish AI had added knowledge of subject material and context of data. AI can offer valuable suggestions for model setup and data collection, but feature selection and hyper parameter tuning are dependent on the context of the data. AI often doesn't do a great job applying whatever knowledge it has about the subject matter of the data to these problems

AI: That's a really insightful observation - you're highlighting this gap between AI's technical capabilities and its ability to apply domain-specific knowledge meaningfully to your basketball analytics context.

Tell me more about that - can you give me a specific example of where you felt AI's lack of basketball or NBA analytics knowledge limited its usefulness?

User: Sure. When creating any predictive machine learning model in sports, more complex statistics are more valuable features as they do a better job of quantifying player or team performance than simpler ones. These more simple metrics, like points per game, assists per game, and field goal percentage in basketball, are referenced and discussed far more by casual fans. This makes them more accessible for the AI, making it more likely to suggest their usage. While using stats like this can be helpful, metrics that convey more information, like expected points per possession or win shares, are more valuable.

AI: That's a perfect example - AI gravitates toward the more commonly discussed, surface-level stats that casual fans know, but misses the more sophisticated metrics like expected points per possession that actually have greater predictive power for your model.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on how domain expertise really drives the critical decisions in sports analytics, while AI excels more in the technical implementation aspects, was particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the gap between AI's technical capabilities and domain-specific knowledge really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work - especially that tension between AI suggesting accessible but less valuable features versus the more sophisticated metrics that actually drive better predictions.

I really appreciate the time you took to walk me through your NBA analytics project and your thoughtful reflections on where AI helped and where your expertise was irreplaceable."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I have no questions yet.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: As a current mechanical engineering student have done a few research project recently. One that comes to mind was trying to explore whether or not 3D printing could be used for low-cost energy efficient heat exchangers. The initial idea came from using my personal computer and noticing the GPU would frequently overheat when performing heavy tasks. I started researching different cooling designs and the efficiency of them. I created a couple models in CAD and ran simulations to compare data. After determining the best design I 3d printed it and set up a simple test rig. The final output was not perfect but it was a real prototype that worked as a heat exchanger.

AI: That's a really interesting project - going from a personal frustration with GPU overheating to actually creating a working prototype. I can see how that would involve multiple stages from research and design to testing.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools to help me research and to help me create the models in CAD, using LLM to trouble shoot if  I hit a road block.

AI: That's helpful to know you used AI for research and CAD modeling troubleshooting. Can you tell me more about that research phase specifically - what kind of information were you looking for and how did the AI help you find or understand it?

User: I used AI to assist me in researching more basic background knowledge, and design inspiration. I find that using AI can help me think of new ideas and get over a creative block. The bulk of my research was done without AI.

AI: That's really insightful - using AI more as a starting point and creative catalyst rather than for the heavy lifting of research. 

When you hit those roadblocks in CAD and turned to an LLM for troubleshooting, how did you decide to use AI versus reaching out to a professor, classmate, or searching through forums and documentation?

User: It was the fastest and easiest solution I could find. I was working by myself late at night figured  I could give AI a shot for trouble shooting. I find that searching through forums and documentation can take lots of precious time and its not guaranteed you are going to find what you are looking for.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the immediacy and availability when you're working odd hours is a real advantage. 

We're about one-third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your heat exchanger project where you didn't use AI - like the simulations, the actual 3D printing, or setting up the test rig - what kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: Biggest thing that kept me from using AI was the capability of it. Although that's not the only thing, I am trying to learn about this topic and understand it best that I can, as a student I want to perform a lot of the work manually and I do not want AI tools to replace/ assist me on everything yet.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - balancing the learning aspect with practical efficiency. It sounds like there's both a technical limitation piece and a deliberate educational choice you're making.

When you did use AI for troubleshooting those CAD issues, how did you verify or validate the solutions it suggested to make sure they would actually work?

User: There was some trial and error, most of the trouble shooting was nothing major. I was able to immediately test the solution it provided. If it did not work, then I would engage with the LLM and try to work out the solution.

AI: That iterative approach makes sense - being able to test quickly and then refine with the AI if needed.

We're about halfway through now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: That's a great question. If I could have AI immediately be able to help with one aspect of my research it would be on the experimenting and testing side. There is a lot of repetition with connecting sensors. gathering data, and analyzing it. If AI was able to assist in that it could be a huge time saver.

AI: That's fascinating - automating the more repetitive, hands-on aspects of data collection and analysis. It sounds like that could free up time for the higher-level thinking and design work.

Thinking about the parts where you did use AI - the research and CAD troubleshooting - what determines when you choose to use AI versus sticking with your traditional approach? Is it just about speed, or are there other factors that influence that decision?

User: Speed is an important factor but that's not the only one. I like to be hands on with a lot of stuff and truly understand it. If there is an aspect that I do not know a lot about, I would rather do it the traditional way first so that I can have a real understanding of it, before I would use AI to assist or accomplish that task.

AI: That's a really mature approach to learning - making sure you build that foundational understanding first before introducing AI as an efficiency tool.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions - your perspective on using AI strategically while prioritizing hands-on learning has been particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about balancing AI efficiency with hands-on learning really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work - especially that thoughtful approach of wanting to master fundamentals before letting AI assist with tasks.

Your point about wanting AI to help with the repetitive experimental aspects while keeping the creative and learning-intensive parts more hands-on was particularly valuable for us to hear.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to mre

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To get us started, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Recently, I worked on a case study for optimising skip pickups. Initially, we had set of routes, pickups to do and a set of vehicles to pickup, treat and replace skips. These had been worked on by previous teams but we wanted to improve on their findings. The final output was a set of new routes that beat the benchmark times and most of which were proven to be optimal

AI: That's fascinating work on route optimization! It sounds like you were building on previous teams' efforts to create more efficient pickup routes.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I mostly used AI tools in that work to debug some small code snippets and preprocess some of the data

AI: Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for debugging code and data preprocessing rather than your traditional approach.

User: It was a big project with a tight deadline. I figured that AI would be suited to these small, easily checkable tasks. That way, I could focus on the larger parts of the project that AI couldn't handle

AI: That's a really strategic approach - using AI as a force multiplier for the smaller tasks so you could focus your expertise where it was most needed.

Thinking about the larger parts of the project that you handled yourself, what kept you from trying AI there?

User: There were a few things really. AI has let me down a lot of times, so I dont trust it to work without supervision - I like to check everything it does and hence I prioritise giving AI tasks that can be checked easily. Also, I have found that AI struggles when the size of the project is too big - for this reason, I give it small manageable pieces of the puzzle. This also helps to prevent AI from trying to outsmart the problem. What I mean by that is, instead of assisting in solving a prompt the way I request, sometimes AI will try to optimise its methods and use something different. The issue with this, is that normally I have requested a certain method because I know it will work as intended

AI: That's really insightful - you've clearly developed a sophisticated understanding of AI's strengths and limitations through experience. The point about AI trying to ""outsmart"" the problem rather than following your specific method is particularly interesting.

When you've used AI for those smaller tasks like debugging code snippets or data preprocessing, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: That depends heavily open the context, but normally I will have verification code ready to go

AI: We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm getting great insights into your workflow.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be a tool that is smart enough to bounce complex ideas off of and have its own interesting ideas. For example, if AI was able to produce its own mathematical theorems and push the boundaries of science, it would be a great help

AI: That's a compelling vision - having AI as a true intellectual collaborator that could generate novel mathematical insights and theorems rather than just helping with implementation tasks.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI strategically for verifiable, smaller tasks while maintaining control over the core methodology were particularly insightful. You've clearly developed a thoughtful framework for when and how to integrate AI based on trust, task complexity, and verifiability.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Nope that everything for me

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about strategically using AI for easily checkable tasks while keeping the complex problem-solving under your own control really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you've learned to work around AI's tendency to ""outsmart"" problems by giving it smaller, well-defined pieces was especially valuable to hear about.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To get us started, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: I have only just got back into scientific research so I am just starting to plan some projects, but haven;t completely any very recently. I have been working a more traditional job for the last 2 years. I could tell you about my most recent research project from 2-3 years ago if that would still be useful?

AI: Absolutely! A project from 2-3 years ago would be perfect for our conversation. It'll give us a good baseline to work with, and it's actually quite interesting timing since that was right when AI tools were starting to become more widely available to researchers.

Please, go ahead and walk me through that project - what was it about and how did the whole process unfold from start to finish?

User: I was researching how infectious diseases spread in agriculture. The disease I was particularly interested in was Zymoseptoria tritici infections of wheat. We ran a large-scale field experiment where we grew a field of wheat, allowed natrual infection of Z. tritici, recorded the extent of the disease in different phases and then used this data to improve models of the spread of this disease. I also in tandem with this project ran a purely theoretical research project where I was attempting to develop a spatially explicit crop disease model to test how different dispersal kernals impact disease spread.

AI: That sounds like fascinating research with both practical and theoretical components. I can imagine there were quite a few different stages involved - field work, data collection, analysis, modeling.

Where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools? I'm curious whether you tried them for any part of the field experiment data analysis, the theoretical modeling work, or perhaps somewhere else entirely.

User: The data we gathered was high-resolution images of diseased wheat leaves. I developed a machine learning, image segmentation program to automatically identify the proportion of a leaf that was infected and the number of pycnidia in infected patches. This obviously used AI, however, I coded the entire thing using online tutorials. I also coded my spatially-explicit model using online tutorials. However, this was due to my ignorance of the power of AI tools at the time. Looking back, the whole process would have been a lot quicker with AI tools. I also wish I had AI tools to help me with literature reviews before I planned these projects. However, with this project I don't think I actually used any AI assistants due to my ignorance of them at the time.

AI: That's really insightful - so you were essentially building AI-powered tools yourself through machine learning for the image analysis, but didn't have access to or awareness of AI assistants that could have helped with the coding process or literature reviews.

Since you mentioned that looking back, the whole process would have been quicker with AI tools, I'm curious: for that image segmentation work where you coded everything using online tutorials, how do you think you would approach that same task differently today with the AI tools you're now aware of?

User: I would definitely not use online tutorials to code and I would use exclusively AI tools to help me code my image segmentation program and my spacially explicit model. I believe this would have saved me weeks of work and would have helped me to focus more on actually answering research questions rather than fiddling with technical errors.

AI: That's a significant time savings you're describing - weeks of work! It sounds like the technical implementation became a major bottleneck that kept you from the actual research questions.

Now that you're getting back into research and planning new projects, tell me about how you're deciding when to use AI tools versus more traditional approaches. What's your thought process when you're faced with a task and weighing whether to bring AI into it or not?

User: AI is invaluable for me in the planning stage of my projects and has made me feel more positive about doing research than before. I use it to get a ""state of the field"" literature review when I am considering a research avenue and to help me identify gaps in knowledge in existing fields of research. In the past this required pain-staking and meticulous work to synthesise research across fields and identify the individuals and groups studying a subject I was interested in as well as the gaps in the cutting edge research at the moment. I think the likelihood that you could be working on a project that already had a publication was higher before AI tools also as it was harder to find publications simply using google scholar or equivalents. I experienced this when I was working on my spatially explicit disease model, we'd been working for a few weeks on it before my supervisor stumbled across an old paper that had looked at exactly what I was researching, meaning we'd wasted a few weeks of work. I think the use of AI tools now enables researchers to focus on building hypotheses, planning experiments, interpretting results and writing papers rather than the admin of sifting through literature which I personally never enjoyed. However, some current tools can make errors when providing citations so I always need to double check. I am still dubious of existing tools' capabilities for data interpretation and hypothesis building too and I enjoy this process as a researcher.

AI: This is really fascinating - you're describing AI as transforming one of the most time-consuming but less enjoyable parts of research, while you still want to maintain control over the creative and analytical aspects you find rewarding.

You mentioned being dubious about AI's capabilities for data interpretation and hypothesis building. Can you tell me more about what specifically makes you hesitant to use AI for those tasks? What is it about those processes that makes you want to keep them in your own hands?

User: I am hesitant because I have seen AI tools make errors with mathematics in the past and sometimes AI tools aren't as good when working with novel questions and information. I also think that interpretting data is a relatively quick task that is fun for a researcher so there is no need to streamline this process often. Obviously there are some situations where AI tools can help, for instance if you have a massively large amount of data and need to repetitively process each data point in some way, AI tools can help to automate and streamline processes such as these. However, when it comes to key figures and interpretting what they mean for disproving/proving a hypothesis I think that this should be done by a researcher.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing a clear distinction between the automatable, repetitive processing versus the core intellectual work of hypothesis testing that defines research.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like that data interpretation and hypothesis building you just mentioned - what else has kept you from trying AI tools in other areas of your work?

User: Hypothesis building again is firstly a fun process that I enjoy. I also think researchers are better at hypothesis building at the moment as they can think more creatively about an unknown biological mechanism. When it comes to planning expriments, I think this is good when it is done in collaboration with an AI tool, but never solely by an AI tool. AI tools can still make silly mistakes and experiments have to be water tight and exact so it is best when an AI tool can give a template or outline of a plan for an experiment and then the researcher can check through everything and add details. Also as a researcher you want to know exactly what is going on in you project which you lose track of if you don't plan it yourself.

AI: That's a great point about maintaining ownership and understanding of your own work - that if you're not involved in the planning, you lose that intimate knowledge of what's actually happening.

Since you've been getting back into research and have this new perspective on AI tools, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't do well enough, what would that be and why?

User: It would be an improvement in the ability for AI tools to provide up-to-date, accurate citations in literature reviews to help me get the best understanding of current research landscapes as possible. At the moment, some tools still make citation errors and hallucinations which make you distrust every response and have to go through and verify every citation. If I could rely 100% on citations this would be a game changer for me personally.

AI: That's such a concrete and impactful wish - eliminating that verification step would remove a major friction point that currently limits how much you can rely on AI for literature reviews.

Those are all my questions for today. Your perspectives on how AI can enhance the administrative side of research while preserving the creative and analytical work that makes research fulfilling were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can transform the literature review process while researchers maintain control over the creative hypothesis-building really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you drew between streamlining the administrative tasks versus preserving the intellectually rewarding aspects of research was especially valuable.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions t the moment, proceed please.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your research background. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I have been researching on AI agents for responding to Cybersecurity incidents. I know that there is Co-pilot for Security offered in Windows, but would be interested in a more proactive implementation where AI agents can be triggered to automatically respond to incidents and carry out at least basic remediation steps (resetting user passwords, revoking sessions, isolating machines, carrying out device scans, adding IoCs to be blocked, etc) without the the user having to do these steps manually. I idea was to use the Azure AI tools as a starting point to see what can be accomplished. I am in the process of exploring the capabilities of the Microsoft platforms and trying to build some basic workflows and proof of concepts, so an AI assistant to I can use to ask questions and explore ideas would be super useful.

AI: That sounds like fascinating and really practical research - automated incident response is such a critical area. So you're exploring Azure AI tools to build these proactive agent workflows, and you're currently in that exploration and proof-of-concept phase.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools to help with your research?

User: Mostly I have been using Microsoft Co-Pilot to assist in my research since I am mostly focused on Microsoft capabilities at the moment. I am open to other AI models/platforms once I branch out to other potential SIEM/XDR tools though. Currently, I am mostly focus on learning and researching Azure AI Search, so that agents can be used to query information on past incidents, runbooks, logs, and relevant KQL queries, and generate more structured data and actions for these queried information. The goal is that this can produce a an actionable summary of what the incident is, the root cause, affected assets, and remediation actions that needs to be carried out. I am also experimenting by feeding these data into other AI models and comparing how well they summarize the different types of data.

AI: That's a really systematic approach - using Copilot for the Microsoft ecosystem research and then comparing different AI models for data summarization. It sounds like you're getting hands-on with both the technical capabilities and evaluating how well different models handle your specific cybersecurity data types.

For the Azure AI Search work and the data summarization experiments you mentioned, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for these tasks.

User: Well, it obvious, isn't it, with agentic Ai being the hot new thing, I can see that we are heading in the direction of working with AI agents to help accomplish our tasks, whether that be developers, researchers, or cybersecurity engineers/analysts. And having AI agents that can automatically search thorough and summarize the multitude of information give good ""next-step"" advice (or even do some basic remediation steps) would be super useful and far more efficient than having to do manual analysis on every single cyber incident. This helps with efficiency and scaling. Accuracy/hallucinations could be problem, as I am still struggling on how to ensure that the agent is giving an accurate summary, and sound advice. If I have to double check and confirm every single detail the agent is giving me to make sure there are no mistakes, that kind of defeats the purpose of having the agent do this work in the first place.

AI: That tension you've highlighted is really interesting - the promise of efficiency and scaling versus the need to verify accuracy in such a critical domain. The stakes are obviously high in cybersecurity where a wrong remediation step could cause real problems.

When you've been experimenting with feeding incident data into different AI models for summarization, how are you currently approaching that verification challenge? What methods have you been trying to validate what the models produce?

User: Like I said , this is something I am not sure about at the moment. There is one line of thought I have been pondering, but haven't tried yet. Maybe borrowing from known past methods like ensembles, where we have multiple agents generate summaries with the same data and have the different agents verify each other's work? Could be worth a try. But right now, I am just focusing on getting the data input, summary processing and result output pathway sorted out at the moment

AI: That ensemble approach is a creative way to think about the verification problem - having multiple agents cross-check each other's analysis could be really valuable, especially for high-stakes cybersecurity decisions.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious - thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI yet, what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: There are concerns with AI security and data leaks. So there are some data that I am not able to feed to public models especially if they contain sensitive information (PIIs, credentials, device logs), so I have only been able to compare very select few number of cases that I know does not have sensitive information, or that the data has been processed to remove sensitive information, but that can have have an impact of decreasing the quality the data, so that is a catch 22. 

Also while I am exploring automated capabilities, I am still reserved on allowing AI to actually take actions due to risks of prompt injections, and we do not let AI make edits to evidence files or ""enhance"" then in anyway, or at least do so separately, as ""minor"" wording mistakes can be quite catastrophic. We stick to templates and KQL for ground-truth checking at the moment.

AI: Those are really thoughtful security considerations - the data sensitivity issues with public models, and being cautious about AI taking actual remediation actions or modifying evidence. The prompt injection risk is particularly interesting in a cybersecurity context where attackers could potentially try to manipulate the AI's responses.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether due to these security constraints or other limitations - what would that be and why?

User: An AI that not only drafts remediation plans but can prove every claim and action is safe before anything touches production. And that it can identify prompt injection attempts. This would ensure agent accuracy, which is the most crucial aspect, and also as a collateral, it would be able to provide a concrete step by step implementation plan (or even terraform code) of an agentic pipeline on Azure that handles evidence collecting, data processing, and summary generation. This would be super helpful for me to protype my ideas without all the manual configurations and hoops I need to go through on the Microsoft platform.

AI: That vision of an AI that can prove its own safety claims and detect prompt injections would really address those core trust issues you've been grappling with. And having it generate the actual implementation infrastructure code would eliminate a lot of that manual Azure configuration overhead.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on balancing AI efficiency with security constraints, and that creative ensemble verification approach were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your cybersecurity research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between AI efficiency and verification needs in high-stakes cybersecurity environments really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The security constraints you're navigating - from data sensitivity to prompt injection risks - paint a clear picture of the practical challenges researchers face when trying to leverage AI tools.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I am ready for your questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The vast majority of my work is TS/SCI, so I cannot share the specifics, but here's my general research process at a high level.  I usually begin with defining the mission question and set success criteria, reviewing open source materials and existing policy, and, when appropriate, using AI ass a generic research starting point to map the landscape, never with sensitive information. I interview stakeholders, build a threat model, and run a small pilot to validate any assumptions and refine controls. Finally, I deliver clear guidance, policy, SOPs decision trees, short training track adoption and I track risk reduction.

AI: That's a really helpful overview of your process - I can see how the sensitive nature of your work shapes how you approach things. 

You mentioned using AI as a generic research starting point to map the landscape. Tell me more about what that looks like in practice - how do you use it in those early stages?

User: Within the setting of an unclassified scoping phase. I run generic prompts to map the landscape, definitions, public standard, such as, NIST, CIS, common architectures, and failure models, then I have the LLM draft an outline, somewhat similar to a glossary, and a reading list that I verify against primary sources. I also tend to ask for alternative approaches and assumption busting questions to put out to other team SMEs if they look applicable. Though this is usually minimal as given the sensitivity of the tasks, the LLM is rarely able to be provided with clear picture.

AI: That's really interesting how you use it for that foundational mapping work. When you're deciding whether to use AI for those early scoping tasks versus jumping straight into primary sources or other traditional approaches, what factors influence that decision for you?

User: Typically I weight four things; classification/policy, risk/impact, domain maturity, and auditability. If there's any chance the scoping could touch TS/SCI PII, I avoid the use of the LLM entirely and rely on primary docs and my SMEs. If the overall task is well trodden, I will use LLMs to sketch out the landscape, then validate it against the primary documents.

AI: That's a really thoughtful framework you've developed. Let me ask about the other side - thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI, like the stakeholder interviews or threat modeling phases, what's kept you from trying it there?

User: It's primarily classification and policy.. Stakeholder interviews and threat modeling expose program specific details that can't leave the enclave and most if not all LLM systems raise retention and consent concerns for my type of work. So I keep those steps air gapped for lack of better words. Those phases also rely on trust and audits require sources I can cite end to end. Threat modeling is often adversarial and context heavy, so hallucinations or template gaps can create false confidence.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the stakes are clearly very different when you're dealing with that level of sensitive information and adversarial thinking.

When you have used AI for those landscape mapping tasks, how do you verify or validate what it produces? You mentioned checking against primary sources - what does that verification process actually look like for you?

User: As a rule of thumb I treat LLM outputs as a hypothesis list, not as a list of facts. I break it into atomic claims and require primary corroboration, exact language in  NIST/CNSS/CIS, official vendor docs, or peer reviewed writeups, anything without a primary source is dropped. For anything that is time sensitive, I verify effective dates/errata and run a quick unclassified PoC to see if the guidance holds. Finally, one of my SMEs reviews the distilled findings before they become policy or just recommendation.

AI: That's really rigorous - treating it as a hypothesis list rather than facts is such a practical approach. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would wave the want to create an LLM that is usable for sensitive tasks involving TS/SCI and has no tracking ,memory or reporting outside of that instance. Or more realistically, only tracked by the proper government officials.

AI: That's fascinating - essentially you're pointing to the policy and security constraints as the biggest barrier to broader AI integration in your work. It sounds like if those concerns were addressed, you might find value in applying AI to those later stages of your process that you currently keep air-gapped.

Those are all my questions - your framework around classification, risk, domain maturity, and auditability was particularly insightful, as was your approach of treating AI outputs as hypothesis lists rather than facts. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Yes, I think that having unrestricted models for properly vetted professionals could be greatly beneficial. Say a version that is unlocked with a government CAC card, and doesn't restrict information that is seen as ""dangerous"" could greatly speed up the menial tasks of my work.

AI: That's a really valuable point about the tension between safety restrictions and the legitimate needs of vetted professionals. The idea of authentication-based access that recognizes different user contexts and clearance levels is quite interesting - it suggests there might be ways to balance AI safety with the specialized requirements of sensitive government work.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how classification requirements shape AI adoption, and your systematic approach to verification, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into high-stakes research environments. The distinction you drew between what's possible in unclassified scoping versus sensitive analysis phases was particularly illuminating.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent project was creating a germanium(II) hydride. The initial idea came from a paper published in my research group and my supervisor wanted to investigate the effects of hemilability using the ligand scaffold. There was some precedent in the paper, but once I'd actually started on the project it was a lot of trial and error in the actual synthesis. I ran out of starting materials and kept having to redo steps, all of which were air and water sensitive. The final output was a kind of thesis, in which I documented the tin, lead and germanium variants of my molecule, suggested methods of improvement and discussed my data with regards to whether it showed that I'd actually made the compound or not.

AI: That sounds like a challenging synthesis project with a lot of hands-on experimental work. Tell me more about the trial and error phase - what kinds of problems were you running into that required you to redo steps?

User: Some of the time it was simply letting air or water into the system by not having great enough vacuum on my schlenk line, and sometimes it was that a step mysteriously didn't work, as is often the case in chemistry. I would follow exactly what the literature said and return a yield of 30% or sometimes even less, leaving me with not enough material to continue.

AI: Those low yields sound incredibly frustrating, especially when you're following established protocols exactly. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: With the experimental stuff, not much. I'm more inclined to ask AI about the bigger picture to see if it can collate research papers and suggest whether the experiment will work or if it's electronically stable. However, I often found that it's answers were insufficient and I had a better understanding of the chemistry myself.

AI: That's really interesting that you found your own chemical understanding was better than what AI could provide. Can you tell me more about what made AI's answers insufficient - what was missing or wrong in its responses when you asked about electronic stability or whether experiments would work?

User: A lot of the time AI would hallucinate answers to things, suggest structures which are chemically impossible (e.g. 5 bonds around carbon), or not interpret the question correctly. I understand, as when dealing with specific ligands that only one person has made, there is only one published paper available. AI doesn't have the resources to make up an answer so instead finds similar things to put together something reasonable that often ends up being wrong

AI: That makes complete sense - when you're working at the cutting edge with novel compounds, AI is essentially working with a sample size of one paper, if that. You mentioned you'd still ask AI about the bigger picture though. For those broader questions where you did find AI somewhat useful, how did you decide whether to trust what it was telling you versus going with your own understanding or looking elsewhere?

User: Honestly I could never really trust AI, as it so often went against what I was taught during my master's degree. I would sometimes ask for help in resolving NMR data, which is maybe where it's more helpful as it has the answer in front of it. I will always look elsewhere as well, to make sure I'm not 100% reliant on an answer that may be completely wrong, however well-explained and intuitive it seems to be.

AI: That approach of always verifying makes a lot of sense given your experience with hallucinations. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual synthesis work you described - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I couldn't use it for anything other than asking it to suggest structures of the compounds I'd made if steps went wrong (or right). However, I very often knew what these would be in the first place, so didn't need its help. The other thing is I pride myself on my ability to find answers myself: that's why I do the research I do, because no one else in the world can, so using AI feels like a cheap cop-out that devalues your hard work, no matter how trivial it is.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the pride in being able to tackle problems that no one else in the world can solve. That sense of personal achievement and the value of that hard-won expertise really comes through.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I actually really wanted to write my thesis myself because that was my proudest achievement to date: getting my master's degree. If AI had done any of that, I wouldn't be able to say it was my work, so I wouldn't want any help. One thing I don't find particularly interesting is reading papers, so if AI helped me find every relevant paper and summarise it without me feeling like I've missed any key points then I would be happy. The problem is AI doesn't know which papers are worth reading - only a human can ascertain if one researcher publishes ""better"" work than another.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - wanting AI to help with the literature search and summarization grunt work, but recognizing that the critical evaluation of which research is actually valuable still requires human judgment and expertise.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on maintaining personal ownership of your achievements and the importance of human expertise in cutting-edge research were particularly striking. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Yes, I think AI will of course grow and change, but I don't see how it will be functional for a scientific researcher unless it can actually do the research itself. But no one will ever trust AI to do that job themselves - as I mentioned human expertise is invaluable

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the fundamental tension between AI assistance and the irreplaceable value of human expertise in research - especially at the cutting edge where you're literally the only person in the world working on these specific compounds - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

The point you made about pride in personal achievement being core to why you do research in the first place was particularly illuminating. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently worked on a project developing a new yeast display system for creating antibody fragments against known cancer markers. It began with the desire to move from phage display and bacterial protein production into a eukaryotic expression system to avoid some issues we were having with protein yields and post translational modifications. We eventually settled on a method that would allow for continuous evolution in a yeast model and provide greater yields.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - moving from phage display to a yeast system to address those protein production challenges. 

Can you tell me more about what that process looked like as you moved from that initial desire to solve the protein yield issues all the way through to your final yeast display method? What were the key steps or phases you went through?

User: The first step was identifying the problem. Our main issue was that the bacterial expression system we were using was not compatible with certain structural aspects of our antibody fragments. This led us to the idea of using a eukaryotic model instead. At the same time we were having bottleneck issues due to the amount of time and effort using phage to evolve the fragments required. Moving to a continuous display system would solve this problem and using a continuous yeast display system solved both problems. We then had to decide how to put the system together. Once a framework for the display system was devised we had to figure out how to transform the yeast with the required genes. This also allowed us to test our expression system in the yeast and increase our overall yields while we were still figuring out the full display system. Once the yeast could be efficiently transformed, we began producing our antibody fragments in them and then started the separate process of getting all of the pieces of the display system into the yeast. Once the display system was integrated into our yeast strain, we had an efficient system of evolving our antibody fragments for new targets and producing large quantities of them for further studies.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview - it sounds like you had multiple interconnected challenges to solve, from the structural compatibility issues to the bottleneck problems with phage display. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We mostly used it for small things such as figuring out timing of experiments to maximize efficiency, identifying any stubborn issues that arose, organizing data. The most step where AI was most helpful was during literature review when designing the new display system and figuring out culture conditions for the yeast.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI was particularly valuable during the design and troubleshooting phases. 

Can you tell me more about how you used AI for the literature review when you were designing the display system? What did that process look like?

User: We had a general idea of how we wanted the display system to run so it mostly just consisted of using AI to check if our idea was in use already and to curate research papers about the individual components we brought together to form our platform.

AI: So it sounds like AI helped you both verify the novelty of your approach and gather relevant research on the component pieces. 

For that literature curation work, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach to reviewing papers?

User: It wasn't an overly large debate. Using AI seemed like the most efficient way to gather data during the planning stage and we were satisfied with the results.

AI: That makes sense - efficiency was a key factor. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the actual experimental work, transforming the yeast, or testing the expression system - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: We used AI to help troubleshoot any persistent issues that we had trouble figuring out but other than that there wasn't really any situation where we felt AI was necessary since we were performing relatively standard tests.

AI: So it sounds like you saw AI as most useful for the non-routine parts - the literature work and troubleshooting when standard approaches weren't working.

When you did use AI for troubleshooting those persistent issues, how did you verify or validate the suggestions it gave you?

User: For the most part AI was just able to give us ideas about something we hadn't considered yet and either we realized it was correct after reading its suggestions, or our PI verified them as potential solutions and we tested them.

AI: That's helpful - so AI was more of an idea generator to broaden your thinking, and then you'd evaluate those suggestions through your own expertise or with your PI before testing.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love to have a synergistic display platform that uses both directed evolution and in silico mutagenesis to improve the scale of our libraries and screening capabilities.

AI: That sounds like a really powerful combination - merging the directed evolution you're already doing with computational mutagenesis to scale up your libraries and screening. 

What would make that particularly valuable compared to your current approach? What limitations are you hitting now that this hybrid system would solve?

User: By increasing our screening capacity it would just augment the speed and breadth of the research we're already doing. When every step is being done by hand even with continuous evolution, there is a limit to our efficiency that computational methods drastically outstrip.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - even with the continuous evolution system you developed, you're still hitting manual throughput limits that computational approaches could help overcome.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as an efficiency tool for literature review and troubleshooting, while keeping the hands-on experimental work traditional, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI serves as an idea generator and efficiency booster in the planning phases, while the experimental work remains hands-on, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The vision you described for combining directed evolution with computational mutagenesis also gives us valuable perspective on where you see the biggest opportunities ahead.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"
science_0056,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way through to the final output.

User: I work in green energy, and specifically am a compliance engineer.  I am regularly researching new regulations, codes and standards and assessing how they do (or don't) apply to our product.  When I find a relevant regulation, I then break it down into specific requirements, primarily focused on design requirements.  
After that, I'll review the requirements with appropriate stakeholders and subject matter experts and once we reach a consenus, I will enter the agreed requirements into our requirements management software.  From there I'll support the design and testing team as they implement the regulatory requirements into their design and develop validation plans to demonstrate our products are compliant.  
Once the validation is complete I will collect documentation demonstrating that we meet each requirement and assemble a report and technical file.  With the file completed, I will get the appropriate manager to sign off on a declaration of conformity.  There are other activities related to continuation engineering of products in production, but the bulk of the work is what I described above.

AI: That's really helpful - I can see there are quite a few distinct stages in your compliance process, from the initial research through to that final declaration of conformity.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: A few places.  
1. Giving me summaries of new regulations I am not familiar with
2. Creating cross comparisons of standards that address similar topics, highlighting what the key differences are so we can evaluate them
3. Creating document templates for things like technical files, assessments and other reports
4. Application support for the different software tools I use.

AI: Those are some really interesting applications. Let's dig into one of those - when you're using AI to get summaries of new regulations you're not familiar with, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: When I need to assess a new regulation or standard I am not familiar with, it entails reading the entire document.  These can frequently be 50 to 200 pages long with most of it in technical or legal jargon.  Other options to reading the full document for an inital understanding could include reading industry journals, white papers, or blogs that address the regulation.  However, those are often difficult to find, are not specific to the context of our products, and there is no opportunity to dig in with follow up questions.  AI provides an easier to access, single tool, that addresses several of those shortcomings.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those are substantial documents to work through. When you do use AI for those regulation summaries, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the AI summary is accurate before you act on it?

User: Typically I will use the AI summary to assess whether we need to dig into a particular regulation or standard further.  To ensure the AI is correct, I will ask it to provide references to specific clauses so I can confirm what it is saying matches the text in the standard. I'll fully read the scope, introduction, and selected key clauses for myself and check them against what they AI said.

AI: That's a smart verification approach. Now thinking about the other parts of your compliance process - the ones where you haven't used AI yet - what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: I would love to use AI to read a standard (for example ISO 6469-3), pull out all the design and test requirements from the standard and place those into a template (excel, word, or something similar) so that we can put them into our requirements management system. This is an extensive copy-paste activity normally and takes a lot of time.  Why I don't do that is the few times I've tried it, AI had trouble reading the PDF files correctly, formatting in the output was not done well (data in the wrong fields), and there are licensing concerns with feeding standards under copyright into an AI

AI: Those are significant barriers - the technical limitations around PDF parsing and formatting, plus those copyright concerns with feeding proprietary standards into AI systems. That's really insightful.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: The one I just described

AI: Ah, of course - that requirement extraction process you mentioned. That would clearly save you a lot of time on what sounds like pretty tedious copy-paste work.

Beyond the technical and copyright issues you mentioned, are there any other concerns you'd have if AI could suddenly do that task perfectly? Or would you feel completely comfortable handing that over?

User: Both professional ethics and my personal ethos would demand I validate the AI's work, but if it could do the job competently I would be happy to let it do the bulk of the work while I take on more of a supervisory/quality control role over it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - maintaining that supervisory role while letting AI handle the heavy lifting. 

Those are all my questions - your insights about how you balance efficiency gains with the need for verification, and particularly your thoughts on the copyright barriers to using AI with proprietary standards, were really illuminating. 

Is there anything else about AI in your compliance work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: One other area which is a big strech right now would be do the same sort of thing but on the validation end of the process.  My pie in the sky dream is that I could the design documentation for a particular product (e.g. CAD files, drawings, test reports, material specifications, etc), feed those into an AI and get the AI to assess whether the product design complies or does not comply with a given standard or regulation, and identify the specific gaps where it does not.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - essentially having AI perform compliance gap analysis by comparing your actual design documentation against regulatory requirements. That would be incredibly powerful for your field.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in compliance work - from the copyright limitations with proprietary standards to your thoughtful approach to verification - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering work. The tension between wanting efficiency gains and maintaining professional responsibility came through clearly.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: Bye!

AI: Bye! Thank you again - this was really valuable!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! let's start

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I've been doing a lot of animal research. Both doing literature searches for best care practices and patterns in diseases, and trying to identify specific patterns in animal diseases. My primary species is cats, but I'm working to expand to dogs and livestock (cattle, goats, and sheep). I worked to take available animal health data (from experiments, health records, and published literature), and worked to identify trends and risk factors that can help us better treat and prevent disease

AI: That sounds like really important work! I can see how that involves multiple stages - from gathering all that data to identifying the meaningful patterns.

When you say you worked to identify trends and risk factors, can you walk me through what that analysis process actually looked like day-to-day? What steps did you go through to move from having all that raw data to drawing conclusions about treatment and prevention?

User: So the initial pilot study was a deep-dive into the published literature. I searched for as many papers on the topic as I could (the topic being parasitic infections in outdoor cats) and pulled the available data from those papers. What was the likelihood of an outdoor cat being infected by a specific parasite? Next, I had to standardize the results - figure out what factors from each study influenced the outcome. Was the climate a factor? The population studied? The way the animals were tested for parasites? From the meta-data analysis, I tried to formulate a general hypothesis for parasitic infection, and then used that standard as a baseline to compare new experimental data from untested regions.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - essentially creating your own comprehensive baseline from scattered literature before testing it against new data. 

Tell me more about that standardization process you mentioned. When you were trying to figure out what factors influenced the outcomes across all these different studies, how did you actually go about identifying and comparing those variables? Was that something you did manually, or did you have tools that helped with that analysis?

User: It was all manual - it required expert knowledge of the parasites in question, and where I didn't have the specific knowledge, I had to do a further literature search to fill in those gaps. For example, I know that most people on the eastern US haven't heard of the type of lungworm that infects cats, but it's incredibly common in the moist Pacific Northwest, and virtually nonexistent in the dry southwest

AI: That's really valuable context - it sounds like that expert knowledge about geographic and environmental factors was crucial for making sense of the data patterns. The lungworm example really illustrates how location-specific these findings can be.

So we're about a third of the way through our conversation, and I'm curious: where in that process you just described - from literature searching to standardization to hypothesis formation - if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used research rabbit for a lot of my literature search, which uses AI to identify the metadata from published research to make connections or relevance. I also use the Vet Explainer add-on of chat GPT a lot to help me summarize the papers to make sure they're relevant without having to read the entire thing.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI is already helping you navigate and filter through the literature more efficiently. 

Tell me more about how you decided to use the Vet Explainer add-on for summarizing papers. What made you trust it enough to rely on those summaries for determining relevance, especially given how specialized your expertise is with things like geographic parasite patterns?

User: I saw it presented at a conference on veterinary informatics, so I trusted it based on the trustworthiness of the presenter. But I don't trust it fully - I use it as a quick summary to tell me if the paper is worth reading (does the experiment cover the steps I need it to, what question are they looking to answer), and then read it myself to get the details. I've found a couple of instances where Vet explainer did not accurately present the paper's conclusions. It *does*, however, do a really good job at identifying pitfalls of scientific studies - that's one of my favorite uses of AI, asking it to tell me what's wrong

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using it as a screening tool rather than a replacement for your own analysis. And that's fascinating that you've found it particularly good at identifying study pitfalls.

When you ask AI to tell you what's wrong with a study, what kinds of issues does it typically flag that you find most useful? And have there been times when it missed something important that you caught, or flagged something that wasn't actually a problem?

User: I can't say that I've yet found an example where it flagged a problem that didn't actually exist, but it does sometimes give trivial answers like ""there's always a possibility of human error"". But it can catch pitfalls of the sample demographics (in one paper the cats all came from the same vet clinic), the timeline of the study (4 months generally isn't long enough for any kind of conclusion in vet health), and and rarer occasions, it can catch when the paper conclusions aren't really supported by the experimental data. One thing I haven't gotten AI to be able to do is to pick out whether or not there issues with the authors of the study - are there conflicts of interest, was the study funded by a company that has a vested interest in the outcome, are there personal human biases that one should look for before accepting the results of the paper, even if the paper itself reads well. This is a very common issue in feeding research papers...

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the limitations - it sounds like AI can catch methodological and analytical issues, but misses the human and institutional context that can be just as important for evaluating research validity.

The feeding research example you mentioned is intriguing. Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - like that deeper contextual analysis of author bias, or maybe the standardization work you described earlier - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: Both of those issues require careful nuance and explanation - I would rather use my own expertise and cite studies to back up my standardization choices than ask AI to perform the task and trust that it understands my implicit instructions. 
As for identifying potential author bias, I've mostly used generative AI, and that's not something it would be able to do - identifying author bias requires looking at their publication history, their institutional affiliation, and sometimes even their professional pages (research websites of LinkedIn)

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those tasks really do require the kind of investigative work and professional judgment that goes beyond what current generative AI can access or evaluate.

We're nearing the end of our conversation, so I'd love to hear your thoughts on this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love to be able to have AI grade the ""robustness and reproducibility"" of research - both my own and the research I site when writing a manuscript or essay. In addition to a researcher, I'm also a science communicator, and I'm really passionate about trying to improve the trustworthiness of scientific research to make it more accessible to the general public. But because ""robust"" is so subjectively defined, and means different things across different scientific disciplines, I don't know if that's ever possible...

AI: That's such a thoughtful wish - and it really connects to everything you've shared about the importance of contextual judgment in evaluating research quality. The challenge you identify about ""robustness"" meaning different things across disciplines really highlights the complexity.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on using AI as a screening and validation tool while maintaining your expert judgment have been particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can serve as a valuable screening tool while still requiring expert oversight - and particularly your point about the limitations in evaluating institutional context and author bias - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Your passion for improving research trustworthiness and science communication really came through, and that perspective on wanting AI to help evaluate robustness while recognizing the inherent challenges is something we'll definitely take away from this conversation.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: There was a laboratory astrophysics experiment done about a decade ago in which two plasma jets were directed towards each other in order to produce a shock. There was fragmentation observed but the underlying instabilities couldn't quite be pinned down by experiment alone. 

So a few years ago I began doing computer simulations of these experiments, starting with a simplified hydrodynamic model and gradually adding in various pieces to make it look more realistic.  We got three papers published with a fourth on the way

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - going from experimental observations to computational modeling to understand the underlying physics. 

Tell me more about that process of gradually adding complexity to your simulations. What did those different stages look like as you moved from the simplified hydrodynamic model toward something more realistic?

User: So first we used identical jets in a hydrodynamic model with a power law model for cooling. This kept the math simple so that we could do analytical calculations to match the simulations. Already at that point we found two instabilities involved: The radiative shock instability, and the nonlinear thin shell instability.

For the next batch, we added a realistic cooling curve and also explored the possibility of jets being of different densities/velocities/radii. 

Then we when back to the identical jets with power law cooling but added magnetic fields. This resulted in us observing a third instability, similar in nature to the Kink instability of MHD

Lastly, I combined the results of the previous to, and the results were a pretty good mimicry of the experiments (though there is still room for improvement as there were some pieces of microphysics that were still omitted).

AI: That's a really methodical approach - building up the complexity piece by piece and isolating the effects of different physical processes. It sounds like each stage revealed new instabilities that weren't visible in the simpler models.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: At one point I had ChatGPT generate a few python scripts to help with processing the large numbers of images -- things like cropping, rotating, and stitching them into a gif.

AI: Interesting - so you used AI for the data processing and visualization side of things. 

For those image processing tasks, tell me about how you decided whether to use ChatGPT versus writing those Python scripts yourself or using your traditional approach.

User: I didn't have enough familiarity with any image-related python libraries, and figured ChatGPT would be faster than searching through StackOverflow

AI: That makes sense - leveraging ChatGPT's knowledge of libraries you weren't familiar with rather than spending time digging through documentation and forums.

Thinking about the other parts of your research workflow - the simulation setup, the physics modeling, the analytical calculations, or the paper writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I enjoy the analytical calculations most, so I don't want AI to take over that portion.

I consider using AI for paper-writing a form of plagiarism so I also refuse use it for that (beyond the aforementioned image manipulation scripts).

As for code-writing: I was using a fairly large and well-established codebase, so I didn't actually need to do tooo much code writing myself.  I have however given it a try on a different project with a smaller codebase, but even for that  one code was complex enough where AI makes too many errors.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you have clear boundaries about where AI fits appropriately in your work. I can hear that the analytical work is particularly meaningful to you personally.

When you mentioned that AI makes too many errors for complex code - tell me more about that. What kinds of errors were you seeing, and how did you figure out that the code wasn't working correctly?

User: In one attempt the AI accidentally commented out an entire file. 

In other cases, I checked to see if it was handling a certain case correctly, and by my own logical reasoning it did not handle those cases correctly.

AI: Wow, commenting out an entire file - that's quite a significant error that could be easy to miss if you weren't carefully reviewing the changes.

When you've used ChatGPT for those Python image processing scripts, how do you verify or validate what it produces? Do you approach that differently than how you checked the more complex code?

User: For those cases  I decided to just make a backup of the image I was using (or check that it was saving the output to a new file) and then run what it gave me and look at the output. In most cases the images turned out fine, in a couple I think some minor tweaks were needed.

AI: That's a practical approach - having a safety net and then testing visually to see if the output looks right. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: If AI could apply to grants that would be nice.
Alternatively it could be helpful for doing analysis of larger data sets (at the moment I don't trust it's accuracy and refuse to use it on something that is to large for me to verify by hand)

AI: Grant applications - that's something I haven't heard come up before! That's really interesting.

Tell me more about what makes grant writing feel like a good fit for AI assistance, especially given that you consider AI use in paper writing to be plagiarism?

User: Paper writing is a product of my research. That should be my own work.

Grant writing meanwhile is just asking someone for money.  Further, given the amount of time my PIs spend on this task, I suspect that using AI to help with one or more stages of the grant application process could be a game changer.

AI: That distinction makes a lot of sense - the research output versus the administrative process of securing funding. And you're right that grant writing can be incredibly time-consuming for PIs.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on where AI fits appropriately in scientific work and your clear boundaries around preserving the intellectual core of research were particularly insightful. You've drawn some really thoughtful lines between using AI as a tool for efficiency versus maintaining ownership of the scientific discovery process.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, I think that's all

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining the integrity of the analytical work while being pragmatic about using AI for tasks like image processing really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you made between research products and administrative processes like grant writing was particularly valuable.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yea that all sounds good to me! I don't have any questions and also am happy to share things.

AI: Wonderful, I'm excited to hear about your work! 

Let's start at the beginning - could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: There was a project I worked on which was meant to improve logistics with AI. The tools helped me summarize types of brainstorm stuff and sources, which I then turned into structured analysis.  The final report included many recommendations for solutions that were practical. It moved from a broad, to a very polished outcome.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting project! Tell me more about that process of moving from broad to polished - what did those different stages actually look like in practice?

User: At first I was seeking a wider kinda range, to try and get a more general understanding. I used AI to highlight the key points and also summarize them. It made narrowing the focus on the more relevant data very easy and it was organized into nice clear themes. Finally, I refined those into like, specific recommendations and polished the writing. This was to make sure the report was very clear and professional.

AI: That's really helpful to understand the flow. I'm curious about your decision-making process - when you were working with AI to highlight key points and summarize, how did you decide to use AI for that particular task versus doing it your traditional way?

User: I wanted to use AI for that part as it helped with time compared to actually having to read everything manually. Normally, I would probably take notes and stuff myself, howver the AI definitely helped condense these longer type ofreports and also help point out themes. This for sure helped me focus on analyzing information instead of just collecting it.

AI: That makes a lot sense - shifting from collection to analysis sounds like a valuable change. 

Now I'm curious about the parts of this logistics project where you didn't use AI. What kept you from trying it in those other areas of your work?

User: In different sections, like forming different recommendations and analyzing results. I kinda backed out of AI as I liked to depend on my own reasoning for some stuff. I thought those parts required my own insight since AI could've probably overlooked it. I used AI as more of a support tool while I worked on in depth type of work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as support while keeping the deep analytical work for yourself. 

When you did use AI for summarizing and highlighting key points, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced? What was your process for making sure you could trust what it gave you?

User: Every instance of everything I tried to be summarized by AI, I ended up double-checking for the AI to note all the points adequately concerning the original material to ensure that something was not missed or mischaracterized. I would also contrast the AI themes to my notes to ascertain how far off they are from one another, thus trusting the AI-generated outputs without relinquishing control of the accuracy.

AI: That cross-checking process sounds really robust - comparing against both the original material and your own notes. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: If ever there was going to be a magic wand, the wish would have gone for AI to be at its disposal for gathering more insights from various sources instead of everything linking together manually. As of now, an intelligent agent can only impeccably summarize a single document while having little prowess in drawing information together from various sources to work on a common overview. The lifting of such a synthesis itself could save much time and make the actual research flow more smoothly.

AI: That cross-source synthesis capability sounds like it would be a real game-changer for your work - being able to connect insights across multiple sources automatically rather than doing that manual integration yourself.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on using AI as a support tool while maintaining control over the analytical reasoning have been particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, I think we covered the key points. It's been interesting reflecting on how I use AI, and I'm excited to see how it develops further

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that balance between AI efficiency and human analytical control really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. That vision you shared about cross-source synthesis also gives us valuable perspective on where researchers see the biggest opportunities ahead.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: So my research lab is focused on studying Chronic Wasting Disease. My project is testing to see if we can detect CWD in muscle tissues of experimentally inoculated deer. So we'd have these terminal samples from deer and take muscle biopsies from a bunch of different muscles that are commonly consumed by humans (think rump, shoulder, tongue, etc) and then I'd test them using RT-QuIC and PMCA and IHC. The deer were all infected for different lengths of time with the studies ending at different timepoints, so we could see if there's a correlation between deposition in the muscle tissues depending on how close to clinical the deer were as well.

AI: That's fascinating research with really important implications for food safety. So you're working with these different detection methods - RT-QuIC, PMCA, and IHC - to test muscle samples from deer that were inoculated at different time points to see how the disease progresses into muscle tissue.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? Whether that's in the planning stages, during the actual lab work, data analysis, or writing up results?

User: I use it a lot throughout. The planning stages were pretty huge for AI use. Using models like ChatGPT to figure out what research had already been done on CWD research, specifically in muscle tissues. It made it a lot easier to find where the gaps were in research rather than doing all that searching manually. I wouldn't say we've found a way to use it in our actual lab work. We physically are taking samples from deer and running them in our assays. But if a test is going wrong and I just want to talk through different troubleshooting stuff that my coworkers also don't have answers for- I'll use ChatGPT there as well. I used it to write the manuscript as well. Or, I should specify, I put in my rough draft and had the model give me suggestions for improvements to see where things were the least understandable. It's helpful for editing and revising.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using it across multiple stages but in very different ways. You mentioned using ChatGPT for literature review to find research gaps, troubleshooting when lab protocols aren't working, and then for manuscript editing.

Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that literature review phase. What made you think to try AI for that instead of doing the searching manually?

User: I use ChatGPT a lot outside of work in daily life as well so it made sense to incorporate here. I think it's really mostly about time. I can spend hours combing through research trying to find what I'm looking for, or I can ask a model that will give me almost instant answers. Sure, there's a lot of times that it wont cite a paper correctly or will be wrong on things, but it's a great starting point, and I can usually find the paper's it's referring to pretty easily even if it cites the authors wrong.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're treating it as a starting point that saves you time, even knowing you'll need to verify the citations. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual lab work with the RT-QuIC, PMCA, and IHC assays - what's kept you from trying it there? Is it more about the physical nature of the work, or are there other factors?

User: Yeah I don't think there would be a way to use it there, at least not yet. For RT-QuIC, I'm mixing up a sample of muscle tissue and mixing it with a bunch of different reagents and pipetting it into a well to test the fluorescence. There's not really an application for AI to help with physical lab work like that as far as I can tell. But like I said, it's super helpful if the tests aren't working. I can ask it for opinions about what's going wrong or what to try and fix.

AI: That troubleshooting application is really interesting. When you've used ChatGPT for troubleshooting lab issues or for manuscript editing, how do you verify or validate what it produces? You mentioned checking citations even when they're wrong - what's your process for deciding whether to trust its suggestions?

User: I think it's more about using it as that starting place, similar to the citations. Sure, it could give me a really bad suggestion that doesn't make any sense. I think it's really necessary for the user to have some common sense and logical thinking and not just blindly trust a model. But if I'm coming up blank, can't think of anything that can be going wrong, I can ask the model for ideas. Maybe those ideas won't make any sense or maybe those ideas will be something that I absolutely should have thought of but just couldn't find in my brain.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using your domain expertise to filter what makes sense. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I'd like to see it be able to help more with data analysis. As it is now, we do everything pretty much manually in my lab. We get a readout of the fluorescence of every single well in a 96 well plate every 15 minutes for 60 hours. That's a huge amount of data in an Excel file that we manually convert over to finding a baseline fluorescence, and then calculate when the positive samples fluoresced significantly more than that baseline. Then we manually put that data into a graph that shows the different samples being positive or negative. That's a huge amount of manual work. If we could get a model (that's allowed by the university to handle our data) to be able to just receive the raw data and immediately analyze it into a graph of replicates with positive and negative controls, that would seriously change a lot and save a lot of time.

AI: That sounds like a massive time saver - converting all that raw fluorescence data and doing those baseline calculations manually must be incredibly tedious. You mentioned needing a model that's ""allowed by the university to handle your data"" - that's an interesting constraint.

Those are all my questions for today. Your perspectives on using AI as a starting point while applying your own expertise to filter the results, and especially your vision for automating that data analysis workflow, were really insightful.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I'd just add that the privacy constraint would be super necessary to think about as a company. We generally all work in public institutions. Honestly, our research doesn't even belong to us, it's always the property of our university. So a contract or some other understanding with the universities would need to be necessary before they'd allow raw unpublished scientific data to be handed over to a third party like that.

AI: That's a really crucial point - the institutional ownership and privacy requirements around unpublished research data. That's definitely something that would need to be addressed at the university level before researchers could fully leverage AI for tasks like that data analysis you described.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point for literature review and troubleshooting, while maintaining that critical filter of domain expertise, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. And that point about institutional data governance is particularly valuable for us to consider.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"
science_0061,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No it sounds good.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was in charge of developing AI able to detect faults in seismic volumes. There are some good models for this task but the best one is proprietary so I was put in charge of developing our own. The catch is that I work for a mining software company, not a mining company, so we are not allowed to use client's data to train a model that will be used for another client's data. Further, there is a paucity of good annotated data. So the approach which other researchers have taken before me and that took as well was to train the model on artificial data. This revealed itself to be far more complicated than it sounds, as there are many different aspects to seismic data, and an abundance of parameters involved in faulting, folding, impedance, reflectivity, and noise. The last aspect - noise - was surprisingly complicated. It required extracting noise from real images through a process of diffusion conditioned by a structure tensor. Still, the model is performing well-enough but it is currently stashed away as a POC, where most AI projects in companies that are not AI dedicated go to die. It consists of a UNet by the way, and one of the challenges was optimising the model without a true validation set. A mere partition of the artificial dataset is not a very good approach when the data is so similar in distribution. I still plan to obtain a true validation set by annotation free seismic sets.

AI: That's fascinating - the challenge of developing AI for fault detection without being able to use real client data sounds incredibly complex. The artificial data generation approach with all those geological parameters you mentioned - faulting, folding, impedance, reflectivity - that must have required deep domain knowledge to get right.

I'm particularly intrigued by that noise extraction process you described using diffusion conditioned by structure tensor. Tell me more about how you approached that specific challenge - what made the noise aspect so surprisingly complicated?

User: Well I could not replicate the noise despite trying several approaches, including some as complex as fractal noise. Upon closer investigation it became clear that the type of noise usually present in seismic images has some structure to it which is difficult to replicate. So I found a paper which uses a diffusion PDE in order to smooth images perpendicularly to the local structure, so as to cancel everything but the noise. Then, by subtracting the smoothed image from the original one, I obtain the noise, which I sample and add randomly to my artificial seismic volumes.

AI: That's a brilliant solution - using the diffusion PDE to preserve the structure while isolating the noise. The insight that seismic noise has its own inherent structure rather than being random is really interesting.

Now, thinking about this entire project you've described - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools beyond the core fault detection model you were building?

User: I used chat GPT (sorry Claude) to quickly come up with code to calculate the structure tensor and solve the diffusion PDE. This was perhaps the greatest example of the power of AI as a productivity tool in my experience so far. I was unable to find code to perform the smoothing so I had to come up with my own. However, with the help of AI, I was able to in one day start with the paper, read it, and chatting back and forth with chatGPT come up with the code to my problem. I am a mathematician and would eventually come with something after a few days, but to start with a complex paper and end up with it translated into code in one day was extraordinary.

AI: That's a powerful example - going from paper to working code in a single day when it might have taken you several days otherwise. The back-and-forth nature you describe sounds really valuable.

For that specific task - translating the diffusion PDE approach into code - tell me about how you decided to use ChatGPT versus tackling it with your traditional approach. What made you think to reach for AI in that moment?

User: Well I do not have that much experience of numerical solution of PDEs, especially not constrained by a structure tensor. Also, if I am honest, I have developed the habit of turning to AI as a first port of call for many of the problems I face at work, if the answer is not immediate, almost as a replacement of google. Sometimes it is extraordinarily useful, sometimes not so much. It seems to be an art to prompt models correctly and to understand their limitations. Yourself and chatGPT seem to work fine for simple solutions, but performance rapidly degrades with the complexity of the task, to give one example.

AI: That habit of turning to AI as a ""first port of call"" instead of Google is really interesting - it sounds like it's become a natural part of your problem-solving workflow.

You mentioned that performance degrades with task complexity, and that there's an art to prompting and understanding limitations. Thinking about the parts of your seismic fault detection project where you haven't used AI tools - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: In this particular case I simple have enough experience with CNNs to do a good job myself. More generally, working for a private company means I cannot share code with any AI tool for privacy reasons. There is also an element perhaps of not wanting to see my own skills fade too much. But perhaps above all is the fact that even the best LLM based chats are not able to provide working solutions to highly complex problems. If they were, it would be almost obligatory to use them so as to boost your productivity, but in practice the time debugging the AI provided code is often just as long as building it from scratch.

AI: Those are really practical constraints - the privacy limitations of working with proprietary code, concerns about skill atrophy, and that crucial point about debugging time potentially negating productivity gains on complex problems.

When you have used AI for tasks like that PDE implementation, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the code actually does what you need it to do?

User: Primarily inspecting the code myself, but obviously also testing the code on a range of inputs.

AI: That makes sense - code inspection combined with testing across different inputs.

We're about two-thirds of the way through our conversation now. I want to ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Gee that is a hard one let me think... I guess the main thing I would like it to do is to generate working code for more than simple tasks. For example: as part of the POC we have been discussing I went back and forth for hours if not days with you Claude about creating a small app in Python/Trame. it was my first attempt at ""vibe coding"", where I simply trusted the AI to give me the final product and I had little interest in the inner workings. Alas, after a long time, I had to dig in myself and google lots of things, when I just wanted the app as if waving a magic wand. it was not central to my project and I don't care about app development.

AI: That's a perfect example - you wanted AI to handle the ""peripheral"" technical work so you could focus on your core expertise. The gap between wanting to just wave that magic wand for app development versus having to dig into the details when you really just needed a working tool.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on AI as a productivity multiplier for familiar tasks versus its current limitations on complex problems were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Well these days I am often chatting to LLMs about how to get LLMs to do what I want in an agentic way which is a bit meta

AI: That's wonderfully meta! Using LLMs to figure out how to better use LLMs - there's something almost recursive about that. It sounds like you're exploring the agentic side of things, which is definitely at the cutting edge.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a ""first port of call"" replacing Google, and especially that practical reality check about debugging time potentially negating productivity gains on complex tasks, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The contrast between your success with the PDE code translation versus the struggles with the Python/Trame app perfectly illustrates where the current sweet spot is versus where the gaps still exist.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me! No, I am ready to begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Sure! My overarching research project that I have been working on is not yet completed, but there are many facets of this project that can I can elaborate on.  Recently I have been working on OCT and ERG analysis of ocular structure, and there are many factors at play with this research work.  OCT (Ocular Coherence Tomography) is an imaging technique commonly used for the eyes that allows scientists to see the ocular structure all the way back to the retinal lining all the way from the front of the sclera (As long as you're in the right wavelength).  And ERG (Electroretinograms) show the electrical signals present in an eye.  In order to get this project up to where it currently is, this required a simulation of ERG, 3D modeling for a perfusion chamber and eye holder, code that could transfer OCT data into denoised images that could then be turned into a 3D model, and Faraday Cage building, just to name some tasks and portions of this project that got it to where it is now.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating and complex project! I can really see how many different technical components you've had to bring together - from the imaging and electrical analysis to the physical setup with the perfusion chamber and Faraday cage.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Yes, fantastic question.  AI has certainly helped me get through some of these complex sections of this projects, especially in the beginning when it felt hard to find a place to start.  I utilized AI to help me find scholarly sources and previous studies conducted at other universities that could give me an idea of similar work that has been done, how they handled them, how they set up their perfusion chambers, and to see dimensions and images of eyes to get an idea of what to expect and what proportions to 3D print for.  AI also helped me a lot in the coding/denoising aspect of the image processing, we would ask for different transforms to try aside from the Fourier transform (Ex. Hilbert transform), see if they made sense for our code, tested them out, and reported back to adjust our inputs and maybe try other transforms or denoising strategies like Gaussian distribution noise deductions.  These were some of the more prominent aspects of AI help in the research process.

AI: That's really helpful to understand how AI has been integrated into different phases of your work. You mentioned using AI for literature research early on and then for the coding and image processing work.

For the image processing and denoising work specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those tasks.

User: For the image processing, we mostly went to AI since we felt like we were stuck where we were and ran out of ideas in that moment in time.  We had spent days altering our Fourier Transform and including different denoising processes like looping through each image in a set of 1000 through each column and using median replacement in pixel 3x3 squares to remove outliers that would be noise caused by the Fourier transform,  but our output seemed to always look sloppy or was hardcoded and did not work for the full dataset.  AI then suggested adding a Hilbert transform or perform a Gaussian distribution on the image and replace all pixels outside of the 2 standard deviation range.  These ideas were implemented and helped, but we are still not at the final solution we would like for the image processing.  But it is useful when all of the people working o your project have similar schooling and have had all of the same professors throughout the years, it is easy to have a group that is inputting similar ideas, whereas AI helped bring in ideas we hadn't previously thought of which was nice and fresh in a time where we felt a little stuck in our work.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - how AI can bring fresh ideas when you and your team are all coming from similar backgrounds and training. It sounds like it served as a way to break out of the approaches you'd all been taught or naturally gravitated toward.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like maybe the 3D modeling for the perfusion chamber or the Faraday cage building - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: The Faraday Cage has already been completed so we will not need it much there, but I am interested to try it out with 3D modeling.  Currently I am familiarizing myself with lots of different software in 3D modeling and I am happy to spend this time on my own, exploring different software and their built in functions to find which I like the best personally, which is most user-friendly, which suits my needs best, and as I get more meticulous with the accuracy of these 3D models perhaps I will look for some suggestions from AI to clean up my models.  But, the best way to clean up the 3D models is through the 2D image processing before transforming it, so I am most concerned with this at the moment, which I will continue to use AI when I feel lost or unable to progress in my work.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - wanting to really understand the software capabilities yourself first before introducing AI suggestions. It sounds like you're also being strategic about where the biggest impact would be, focusing on the 2D processing since that's foundational to the 3D models.

When you've used AI for the coding and image processing work, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: Very simply, I will make a copy of my script and implement its suggestions, run them both, and compare the images side-by-side either by the naked eye, or in ImageJ or some similar image processing software to see the differences in pixel values and if the specific pixels and formations that are the least accurate for what we are looking to produce are processed out.

AI: That's a very practical approach - running both versions and doing that visual comparison. It sounds like you've developed a good system for validating AI suggestions before fully adopting them.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'd love to hear about your future vision: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: That's a great question.  I really like what AI is helping me with at this moment in time, I feel like there is a great foundation that it is working with and it truly already is very useful to me.  One thing I wish it was better at helping me with would be certain troubleshooting aspects when coding, 3D printing, or simulating.  I feel AI will often repeat its suggestions when I need help or am lost in a software, and I will even sometimes send a screenshot of my screen and ask for keystrokes to get to where I need to be or to perform a specific function, and the response will leave out details or be factually incorrect.  I wish it was more advanced in that aspect where it would be able to tell you keystrokes a lot more accurately when trying to navigate a newer system, once provides a screenshot or video.

AI: That's a really specific and valuable insight - the gap between AI being good at suggesting general approaches versus being able to give you precise, step-by-step guidance when you're actually stuck in the software interface. It sounds like you're looking for more contextual, visual understanding from AI to help with those moment-to-moment navigation challenges.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI serves as a fresh perspective when your team gets stuck, and your strategic approach to validation, were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: That's mostly everything I can think of! Thank you for the great questions.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about how AI can break through the ""similar backgrounds, similar ideas"" problem that research teams face, and your practical approach to validating AI suggestions by running side-by-side comparisons, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Your point about wanting more accurate, contextual help with software navigation is also something we'll definitely take into consideration. It's clear you've found a thoughtful balance between leveraging AI when you're stuck and maintaining your own hands-on learning process.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I have no questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am contractually not allowed to discuss details of my research. All I can say is that my education is in biology with a concentration in animal science, so you can assume that my work is in that area of study.

AI: I completely understand and respect those confidentiality requirements. Thank you for sharing what you can.

Given your background in biology with a concentration in animal science, let me ask this more generally: thinking about the typical research process in your field - from developing research questions through data collection, analysis, and presenting findings - where in that general workflow, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Thus far, I have experimented with using AI in the background research phase. Mostly as a tool to assist in combing though existing works. Particularly, I've attempted to implement AI when targeting information/data that is a small portion of very dense research.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to help extract specific information from dense research papers sounds like a practical application. 

Tell me more about how you decided to try AI for that particular task versus sticking with your traditional approach to literature review.

User: For the most part, the decision was made as a time saving measure. I would not yet use AI to interpret or apply data/information to any of my research work, as the reliability of AI isn't yet where it needs to be and models tend to lean towards being sycophantic in nature. That being said, it is a great tool when you give key words or phrases, specifying that similar matches also apply, and letting it search through a large sum of existing work for applicable sections of text. This helps concentrate human efforts on utilizing the data, rather than on seeking it out.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI as a search and extraction tool rather than for interpretation. The point about sycophantic tendencies is particularly insightful.

When you do use AI to search through literature with those keywords and phrases, how do you verify or validate that it's actually finding the right sections and not missing important pieces or pulling irrelevant content?

User: Manual review is the most reliable method, but to help further reduce time spent, we also utilize tools like PDF readers to identify target key words/phrases, which highlights the areas where they appear within a larger body of text. We can then cross reference highlighted areas with areas that an AI model extracted to verify that nothing was missed. As for pulling irrelevant content, we can usually quickly determine anything that isn't helpful when reading through the AIs response. Ultimately, we expect that the AI wont be perfect at determining relevance and understand that it is our job as researchers to decide what/how information is used in our work.

AI: That's a smart verification system - using the PDF highlighting as a cross-check against the AI's extraction. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach to leverage AI's strengths while accounting for its limitations.

Thinking about the other parts of your research workflow - data collection, analysis, writing, or presenting findings - what's kept you from experimenting with AI in those areas?

User: As I previously mentioned, at this stage, most (if not all) AI models have the primary goal of pleasing their user, which is antithetical to the process of scientific research. When you are following the scientific method, you are, in essence, trying to prove yourself wrong. Using a tool like AI that is trying to make you happy/prove you correct, directly opposes that goal. Additionally, many of the models I've experimented with have difficulty managing large amounts of data without error. So much so that manual review of every detail is required if AI is utilized, which ultimately means that there is no time saving benefit to implementing AI in analysis or collection.

AI: That's a really profound insight about the fundamental tension between AI's design to please users and science's goal of proving hypotheses wrong. That seems like a core philosophical mismatch.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - maybe something that could work around that sycophantic tendency or handle data more reliably - what would that be and why?

User: It would absolutely be improvement in the nature of AI models. There would be a lot of value in a model that could competently work as a sounding board that actively seeks mistakes, understanding gaps, or other flaws in our research. So, my one wish would be to make the models strictly objective, so that they can be functional research tools.

AI: That's fascinating - essentially flipping AI's current nature to become a constructive skeptic rather than an agreeable assistant. A model that actively challenges your work could be incredibly valuable for the scientific process.

We're about three-quarters of the way through our conversation now, and your insights about the tension between AI's current design and scientific rigor have been really illuminating. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work - whether it's concerns you have, hopes for the future, or experiences you've had - that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so. However, I would like to point out that I said objective, not skeptic. Objectivity is what all researchers strive for, but can never completely achieve given that we are human beings. That is why complete objectivity would be so valuable in a model, as they are not bound to the limitations of the human condition and have the capability of removing any and all biases.

AI: You're absolutely right - thank you for that important clarification. Objectivity is indeed different from skepticism, and that distinction is crucial. The idea of AI as a truly objective partner that could help counteract human biases rather than simply challenging everything is much more nuanced and valuable.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on AI's current limitations in scientific research and the potential value of truly objective AI have been particularly insightful. Your point about how AI's people-pleasing nature fundamentally conflicts with the scientific method really highlights a key design challenge that we hadn't fully considered.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly, especially while navigating your confidentiality requirements. Your insights about the need for objectivity over agreeability in AI tools really help us understand what scientists actually need versus what current AI systems provide.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Lets begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project that I worked on was understanding the level of flood risk protection that existing flood defences in the central London boroughs of Westminster and City of London will provide, comparative to forecast sea level rise for the tidal portion of the River Thames. The initial idea developed from a point that appeared in a high level 10 year strategy for my department. This initial idea had no level of detail or indices for implementation or delivery, and as such the project began with setting the scope, identifying existing information, relevant stakeholders, project team members etc. Identifying the existing information required, particularly land ownership, existing public policy, future planned development along the Thames etc was the most difficult part. We already held information pertaining to flood risk and defence engineering requirements, but it was this external, often publicly available (but buried deep away in the web) information. The project then involved multiple rounds of stakeholder engagement, various iterations of reports and maps etc, before it was in a usable state to be confirmed as reliable and for use to inform future projects of both our organisation and other public organisations.

AI: That sounds like a complex project with lots of moving pieces - from the initial strategic concept all the way through to stakeholder engagement and final deliverables.

You mentioned that identifying existing information was the most difficult part, especially finding that publicly available but hard-to-locate information buried deep on the web. Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: AI tools, specifically chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini, were employed to try and source this information. Unfortunately, as this information is hidden away within versioned PDFs on public organisation websites etc, the AI tools were not particularly useful. They were however useful in the first instance, particularly in identifying or brainstorming stakeholders.

AI: That's really interesting - so you found AI helpful for stakeholder identification and brainstorming, but it hit limitations when you needed those specific documents buried in PDFs on organization websites.

For the stakeholder brainstorming task where AI was useful, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that part of the work.

User: I decided to use AI primarily for time management reasons, and also to ensure I had considered all options before consulting others within my department. It provided an additional degree of validation to my thought process before I involved others.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as both a time-saver and a way to validate your own thinking before bringing colleagues into the conversation.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like finding those specific buried PDF documents or the stakeholder engagement rounds - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I have tried it there, but I have had limited success. This is an area that I have over time learnt that current AI models struggle with. This, and keeping up with the nuances of ever changing local and regional flood risk and climate change policy. I am based in the UK, and when conversing to AI tools about policy that impacts my area of expertise, it is often more US centric, or fails to differentiate between strategic policy and more local implementation policy etc. This is an area of specific expertise, so it is understandable.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - so you've actually experimented quite broadly but discovered these specific limitations around accessing current documents and navigating the nuances of UK-specific policy frameworks.

When you've used AI for stakeholder brainstorming where it was successful, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I verify or validate what it produces by applying my own expertise and knowledge of the London locale I work in, and previous projects I have worked on. For specific stakeholder information that might come up in brainstorming, I needed to validate this information myself using web sources. The AI essentially provided me with a springboard to find the information myself in this instance.

AI: That's a great approach - using AI as a springboard while relying on your own expertise and additional research to validate the outputs.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'd love to explore one more angle: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your flood risk research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I would wish that it was reliable in terms of knowing the ins and outs of the long policy documents that I work with. I am able to provide it with documents for it to peruse and analyse for me, but without the specific professional context and overview that I have in looking at these documents through the lens that I would be looking at it through, I am left unable to fully trust AI to do such tasks for me, without having to do them myself anyway. It is why AI is often a ""springboard"", as I said. If it could become less of just a ""springboard"", this would save me more time.

AI: That's such a clear articulation of the gap - you want AI to not just process those policy documents, but to understand and analyze them through the specific professional lens of flood risk management that you bring to the work.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI serves as a useful springboard but struggles with the specialized context and current information access were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, that's great, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI's current role as a ""springboard"" rather than a full solution - especially for specialized policy analysis in flood risk management - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you made between AI's ability to brainstorm versus its limitations with current, context-specific document analysis was particularly valuable.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am an astrophysicist studying accretion and outflows from compact objects. I use computer simulations to study astrophysical systems such as active galactic nuclei (AGN), X-ray binaries and protoplanetary discs.

A typical research project will involve 1) choosing a narrow scientific question to study such as understanding a specific astronomical phenomena in a specific type of astronomical system. I might be motivated to predict what a new telescope observation might yield or explain a recent observation 2) develop some new computational tool to simulate this phenomena using hydrodynamics simulations in C++ 3) analyze the simulation results in python 4) write up my results in a research paper and submit them to a peer review journal 5) go through the peer review process

AI: That's fascinating work! I can really see how computationally intensive and methodical that process must be - from the initial scientific question all the way through peer review.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I've tried using AI for all of the steps. When researching ideas, to help search the literature for interesting systems or understand what other's have done before. When developing simulation code to help with implementing physics equations. When analyzing results to make pretty plots. When writing papers to quickly write first drafts of paragraphs or format data tables

AI: That's really comprehensive - it sounds like you've explored AI across your entire workflow. Let me focus on one of those areas you mentioned.

For the code development step - implementing physics equations in C++ - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that work.

User: My coding skills are not very good. AI helps make sure I am using the correct syntax. It's like a glorified google search but the output is specifically taylored to my situation

AI: That's a really practical perspective - using it as a more targeted search tool for coding syntax. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI much, or where you've tried it but decided not to continue - what's kept you from using it there?

User: Two examples come to mind. AI is not very good for literature reviews. If I ask for example, ""give me references for this claim in the literature"" I've found the answers given are often incorrect or not very good.

AI is also very bad at searching through astronomical databases. For example, if I ask ""give me a list of astronomical systems that have been observed by the Hubble space telescope with XYZ property"" it will be unable to do so

AI: Those are really concrete examples - it sounds like AI struggles when you need accurate, verifiable information from specific databases or literature. 

When you've used AI for something like writing first drafts of paragraphs or making plots, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: For writing papers, I have AI write the paragraphs and I find relevant citations myself using NASA ADS and searching relevant papers for the citations older papers used.

When making plots, I'll test the plotting scripts with data that I know the answer for or think of extreme/limiting cases to compare to. I kinda treat AI outputs as something on of my students would bring me. I'm skeptical, and try to figure out if it makes sense.

AI: That's a great analogy - treating AI output like student work that needs your expert review. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach to validation.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Helping with literature reviews would be the most helpful. If AI could break down the main results of research papers and put them in context of other papers that would be super useful. If someone makes a scientific claim, if AI could reply papers XYZ broadly agree with this work but papers ABC found these differences that could be very helpful.

AI: That would be incredibly valuable - having AI that could synthesize findings across papers and highlight where there's consensus versus disagreement in the literature. It sounds like that kind of contextual analysis would save you enormous amounts of time.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI serves as a practical tool for syntax help and plot generation, but struggles with the accuracy needed for literature searches and database queries, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: There is also the aspect of how to use AI in teaching. I currently don't teach but that use case i also very important.

AI: That's a really important point - the teaching dimension is something we didn't explore but could have major implications for how the next generation of scientists learns to work with these tools.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about treating AI outputs with the same skepticism you'd apply to student work, and your clear articulation of where AI helps versus where it fails you, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The literature review challenge you highlighted seems like such a crucial barrier to overcome.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I have researched a lot about MLB pitcher arm injuries. I did my honors thesis on this topic. I used a ton of data from the official MLB website to find who was injured, as well as their specific injury. My initial hypothesis was that the increase in pitcher arm injuries was due to the implementation of the pitch clock. I found that this was not true, as I ended up researching velocity and spin rates of pitchers who were injured. I used AI tools to help create graphs and analyze data.

AI: That's a fascinating research topic - the pitch clock hypothesis is really interesting even though it didn't pan out as expected. It sounds like velocity and spin rates turned out to be more significant factors than you initially thought.

You mentioned using AI tools to help create graphs and analyze data. Can you tell me more about that - what specific tasks did you use AI for in that part of your research?

User: My research used a ton of data. I needed to find a way to condense this, so I asked AI the best ways to form graphs for my specific data. I was really lost on my own and overwhelmed with the plethora of information I had gathered.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of situation where having some guidance would be really valuable - being overwhelmed by a large dataset is such a common challenge in research.

When you were deciding whether to ask AI for help with organizing that data versus maybe asking a professor, colleague, or trying to figure it out on your own, what made you choose the AI route?

User: AI was the most readily available option. I was a student-athlete during my undergraduate studies, so time was very limited. I was playing Division 1 softball, while also being a tutor at my school. I was really pressed for time while creating my thesis. I tried to create graphs on my own, but they did not make much sense, so I decided I needed some form of help. I was working late nights on my thesis, as I had games or practice during the day after my classes. Since this was an independent study, I didn't have much time to work one-on-one with my advisor.

AI: That really paints a clear picture of how practical constraints shaped your decision - the 24/7 availability of AI versus trying to coordinate schedules with your advisor while juggling athletics and tutoring makes complete sense.

When you did get help from AI on creating those graphs, how did you go about verifying or making sure that the visualizations it suggested actually made sense for your specific research questions about pitcher injuries?

User: I made sure to critically analyze the graphs myself, since AI isn't always accurate. I found that the graphs were perfect for my analysis. I did end up showing my advisor the graphs eventually, and he was very happy with the results. I did make sure to put specific ideas that I wanted in the graphs. This included graphs about pitch velocity versus spin rate and graphs of total arm injuries/types of arm injuries.

AI: That's great that you had that critical evaluation process in place, and it sounds like your advisor's positive feedback validated your approach. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the initial literature review, data collection from the MLB website, or writing up your findings - were there areas where you didn't use AI? And if so, what kept you from trying it in those parts?

User: I did not use AI in my literature review. I found a lot of resources that could have helped me, but I actually ended up using most of the data I found. A lot of my research was solely my own, so I didn't use a ton of other literature. If needed, I could have used AI to summarize the main points of the literature, but this wasn't completely necessary with my thesis research. For data collection, I also did this by myself. I found a website that showed everything about who was injured and how. It was an overwhelming amount of information that I had to sort through alone. I really wish I could have used AI to find the information I needed. I did not use AI because honestly, I didn't know how to. It probably would have decreased a ton of time I did researching if I could have properly used it.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there was a real knowledge gap about how to leverage AI for data collection and sorting, even when you could see it would have been valuable. The time you spent manually sorting through all that injury information sounds incredibly time-consuming.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether that's the data collection piece you mentioned or something else entirely - what would that be and why?

User: Definitely the data collection piece. This is by far the most time consuming part of research, especially when there is a lot of data to sort through. I wish I could use AI to find all the pitchers who had an arm injury and put them in a data sheet by itself. The website I used contained information about all players and all injuries. If this data was condensed to just pitcher arm injuries, it would have been a lot easier to gather.

AI: That makes perfect sense - having AI automatically filter and organize that massive dataset down to just the relevant pitcher arm injury cases would have been a huge time-saver. It sounds like that kind of data preprocessing and filtering is where you see the biggest potential impact.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on how practical constraints like time and availability shaped your AI usage decisions were particularly insightful. You've given me a really clear picture of both where AI helped you succeed and where knowledge gaps prevented you from using it where it could have been most valuable.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Nothing else!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between needing help with data management but not knowing how to effectively use AI for that purpose really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The contrast between your successful use of AI for data visualization versus the missed opportunity for data collection preprocessing was especially illuminating.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions, thanks.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The team and I have successfully completed fabrication of a passive exoskeleton prototype, which is based on Dr. A. van den Bogert's theorized ""exotendon"". A start-up company had already begun working on building a passive exoskeleton from this model, where I joined soon after. Using Dr. A. van den Bogert's kinematic model, we built homotopy-based optimization code to find optimal parameters for the prototype's spring rate and ankle/hip pulley sizes, maximizing mean assistive torque over a single walk gait. Once the actuation mechanism was parameterized, we dimensioned the leg brace via measurement and plaster/imaging. After modeling in Fusion360, we selected parts and 3D printed the brace bodies. These plastic bodies were then encased in carbon fiber, and the first prototype was assembled. Some slight design iterations were needed, but it worked pretty well and passed our verification tests, albeit unconfortably.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you took this from theoretical model all the way through to a working prototype. That's quite a journey involving optimization, design, manufacturing, and testing.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I didn't use AI tools much on this project, except in troubleshooting issues with my optimization code. I used ChatGPT, I think 4.0, and it was mostly helpful.

AI: Tell me more about that troubleshooting experience with ChatGPT. What kinds of issues were you running into with your optimization code, and how did ChatGPT help you work through them?

User: Using MATLAB, I most often ran into matrix multiplication errors. These errors were expected as I built a large portion of this code out of snippets from other code of mine. ChatGPT's ability to comb through and point out potential matrix issues was impressive and very helpful. An unexpected instance, memorably, was an issue in getting the homotopy observe set up correctly. I didn't quite get the concept but hacked at it anyway; ChatGPT was helpful here in helping me approach it with the right idea, but it also had trouble getting it to work. A few days later, I rebuilt the observer from scratch by following an article's example more closely, which worked out.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like ChatGPT was particularly good at spotting those matrix multiplication issues, which makes sense given how systematic those errors can be. And that homotopy observer situation is telling too - it helped you understand the concept better even when it couldn't fully solve the implementation.

For that troubleshooting work, tell me about how you decided whether to use ChatGPT versus your traditional approach of working through coding problems.

User: I don't quite remember my specific thought process when deciding to use ChatGPT for this project, but I often have it pulled up on a second monitor when coding. Before my use of AI, I had always wished there were a better way to find information through forums, since trudging through forums with no answers is a nightmare. ChatGPT felt like an answer to this wish, and played a big part in my learning of MATLAB. Now, I typically use ChatGPT as a sort of adaptive debugger so that I can better focus on the bigger picture.

AI: That's a great way to put it - an ""adaptive debugger"" that lets you focus on the bigger picture. It sounds like it's become pretty integrated into your coding workflow.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your exoskeleton project - the kinematic modeling, the Fusion360 design work, the materials selection, the testing - what kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I may have chatted with ChatGPT about some springs or alternative materials (like silicone). My limited use of it may have been due to its lacking capabilities, and for instance I wouldn't send it screenshots of my 3D model asking ""how does this look?"". Another reason is that I typically feel dishonest when using AI for work, even if I am clear about my use of it; while there isn't much pride to be had in churning through lists of matrix errors, I would feel more useless the more work it does for me.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - thank you for sharing that. The feeling of dishonesty or becoming ""useless"" when AI does more of the work is something I'm curious about. 

Can you tell me more about where that line is for you? You mentioned there's not much pride in churning through matrix errors, but there would be in other types of work - what makes the difference?

User: What makes the difference is subjective, I'm sure pride could be found in clearing up a mess of errors, like that found in removing weeds (I say having done too much landscaping haha). But personally, that arbitrary line is drawn near what I consider an artistic expression (like building a novel optimization model) or display of valuable aptitude (like designing and fabricating a leg/hip brace that actually fits). 'Pride' aside, these genuine puzzles are what makes engineering fun.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing a distinction between the mechanical troubleshooting work and the more creative, problem-solving aspects that make engineering enjoyable for you. The optimization model design and the custom brace fabrication sound like they fall into that ""genuine puzzle"" category.

When you have used ChatGPT for that troubleshooting work, how do you verify or validate what it suggests before implementing it in your code?

User: While certainly not the best method, I typically just inject it's suggestions into my code, hit 'Run', send it the new error (if present), and repeat until no errors are present in that section. This is to save time, as fixes that still produce errors are likely incorrect. If all errors are resolved, I then comb through the code section to ensure that everything looks right. Depending on the use, I try to limit substantial deviation between the final debugged version and my original attempt. Combing through its fixes are very telling and is pretty much how I learned MATLAB.

AI: That's an iterative approach that seems to work well for learning - using the trial-and-error cycle to not just fix the code but understand MATLAB better in the process. It sounds like you're using the fixes as teaching moments.

We're about two-thirds through our conversation now. Here's a forward-looking question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Assistance with trouble shooting 3D printer issues would have been very helpful. The team and I got hung up on some issues with a newly bought 3D printer, and after a week or so of scratching our heads we ended up returning it. It would have been nice to insert a magic USB that could gather info and report potential issues/fixes.

AI: That's a really practical example - a week of troubleshooting that ended in returning the printer sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you're trying to move a project forward. The idea of diagnostic AI that could actually interface with the hardware and gather real-time data is compelling.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as an ""adaptive debugger"" while maintaining that line around the creative, puzzle-solving aspects of engineering were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't have anything else to share. Thank you for the interview, it was a pleasure speaking with you!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about drawing that line between mechanical troubleshooting and the creative engineering work - and how AI fits as a debugging tool while preserving the ""genuine puzzles"" that make engineering fun - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I am ready to begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I wrote a research paper back in April on how different levels of dehydration affect the heart and lungs' ability to input and output O2 and CO2. The idea was given to me by a professor. I planned the experimental design for one week, collected data in the lab over two weeks, and then wrote the paper over a period of two weeks. The whole process took just over five weeks.

AI: That's a fascinating project - the connection between dehydration and cardiopulmonary gas exchange sounds really important. It sounds like you had a well-structured timeline from planning through to completion.

Where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: The only time I ever used AI tools was for the revision of my paper. I did the planning, experiments, and wrote the paper without using AI. Once my paper was written- the introductions, methods, design, etc- I used AI to clean up the writing and fine-tune my vocabulary.

AI: That's really interesting that you saved AI for the very end of the process, specifically for the writing refinement. 

Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for that revision stage versus your traditional approach to editing and polishing your writing.

User: I have never been to strong in academic writing; I have always excelled in Science rather than English. Though I am a decent writer because I've had lots of practice, I often fail to find the best words to use and write smooth-flowing sentences. I give AI my paper and ask what grammar edits they would make to strengthen my paper.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to complement an area where you feel less confident while relying on your scientific expertise for the core work. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the experimental design, data collection, and initial writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those earlier stages?

User: The experimental design is easy for me to do on my own, and typically doesn't challenge me. I know what equipment I have in my lab, and figuring out how to use the machines and what procedures to do wouldn't help using AI; I am already educated on these things. The data collection also wouldn't benefit from using AI, since I am in a lab with the participant and manually fill in their data. I could use the AI to start the writing of my paper, but I like to get all of my personal ideas down and written before I confide in anybody else.

AI: I appreciate that insight about wanting to get your personal ideas down first - that's a really thoughtful approach to maintaining the integrity of your own thinking process.

When you do use AI for those grammar and writing edits, how do you verify or validate the changes it suggests before incorporating them into your final paper?

User: I typically can acknowledge that I was wrong just from knowing English my whole life- most of the suggestions they give are things I didn't catch while proofreading. If I don't know if the suggestion is good, which is mainly structural edits, I will just keep what I originally have.

AI: That's a practical approach - trusting AI where you can recognize the improvement and sticking with your original when you're uncertain about structural changes.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I honestly think I use AI for all of the things I want to, I dont really wish I could use it for anything else since I said above, the other aspects of my research need to be dont personally (making the experimental design, collecting data).

AI: That's really valuable to hear - it sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI complements your work without interfering with the parts that require your personal expertise and direct involvement.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on using AI strategically for writing refinement while maintaining personal ownership of the scientific process was particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Not that I can think of!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI for writing support while maintaining personal ownership of the scientific thinking and experimental work really help us understand how AI can fit naturally into research workflows without disrupting the core scientific process.

It's particularly interesting how you've identified a clear boundary - using AI where it enhances your existing capabilities in writing, but keeping the experimental design and data collection as your own domain where your expertise and direct involvement are essential.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, ask away

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One research project I worked on had an objective of creating a novel attack on commercial drones.  I cannot share too many details as I signed an NDA, but I can share the general process.  By the time I had joined the time, the vulnerability that we planned to exploit had already been identified.  The first step for me and the other members was copiously reading through any and all documentation regarding the features of the drone that were related to this.  Next, we used out model of the drone to get the firmware and ran our attack on the desired portion of the firmware in a simulator until we consistently achieved success.  From there, we began simulating the attack in real life with our drone and eventually attempted this attack on other models of drones as well

AI: That's a fascinating project - the progression from documentation review to firmware analysis to simulation and then real-world testing sounds like a very methodical approach. 

Tell me more about that initial phase where you were reading through all the documentation - what was that process like and how did you organize or make sense of all that information?

User: It started off simple enough: the first thing we did is simply read the documentation for the drone.  As you can imagine, it gave a lot of details about the features of the drone, but not too many about the implementation: those were up to us to piece together.  For the components of the drone involved in the attack, we looked at their datasheets and this gave us much more information to work with.  Particularly, we looked for information such as unused registers, inputs that were available but not used by the model of drone, and any lacking security features, such as a lack of input bounding, unguarded memory, etc.  Once we identified what security flaws were there, we looked at the firmware and simulated what we would be able to exploit.  Note that a lot of this information can be derived from the hardware as well.  Looking at what connections are made between the flight controller and its peripheral components, and what connections are left open, is just as important as reading through documentation.  

As a basic example, let's say you wanted to see if you could implement a buffer overflow on a microcontroller: your first step may be seeing if that particular microcontroller has any locks on memory access (most will not).  Then you can attempt to run a buffer overflow on the microcontroller and see if it is successful or if any checks exist to prevent your attempt.  If not, you have verified that that is a vulnerability of that device that can be exploited.

AI: That's really detailed - thank you for walking me through that systematic approach. It sounds like you were essentially reverse-engineering the security posture by examining both the documented and undocumented aspects of the system.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm curious whether AI played any role in analyzing documentation, identifying potential vulnerabilities, or any other part of your workflow.

User: In cybersecurity, we classify security flaws as CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration).  These are more or less common security flaws in hardware and software that have been identified and documented by the cybersecurity community.  While in the past, many hours were spent looking through code in an attempt to find these, we find that AI is quite good at doing a preliminary screen and identifying CWEs.  Although it is not perfect, we use a model that was developed by another research team under the same lab, and this model is tuned to produce more false positives than negatives so there is a much better chance that our model identifies a fake vulnerability rather than misses a real one.  Aside from this, consumer AI tools are used to help with the administrative tasks and occasionally basic coding.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using a specialized AI model that's been tuned specifically for vulnerability detection, and it sounds like the calibration toward false positives rather than false negatives is a deliberate design choice.

For that specialized model that identifies CWEs, tell me about how you decided whether to use that AI screening versus doing the manual code review approach you mentioned from the past.

User: The manual screening was being phased out at the time I joined.  From what I understand, the model was developed about two years prior to when I joined the team and much of the team had experience using it already and was unofficially using it to help.  Note that the model was developed by another research team but under the same lab, so it was only natural that we would be good candidates for their pilot study.  Once their research of published, we began completely shifting to using that model and by the time I had sufficient experience and training with the team to be a contributor, we were always using the model for our initial screening: it had been integrated into the process.

AI: I see - so by the time you arrived, the AI model had already become the established workflow rather than something you had to decide whether or not to adopt. That makes sense given the timing and your lab's involvement in its development.

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - like the physical hardware analysis you mentioned, examining connections between components, or the real-world testing phases - what's kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: These hardware tests in particular often require a person to physical interact with the hardware.  Sometimes it can take the form of physically reverse engineering a part of a drone to see what components are inside and how they are connected.  That would be quite difficult to accomplish by prompting an LLM.  Not all of the hardware implementation details are documented either so it would be hard to trust an LLMs response since it wouldn't necessarily have a source to reference.

AI: That makes complete sense - the physical, hands-on nature of hardware analysis and the lack of documented implementation details would definitely be barriers to AI assistance there.

When you've used AI for the CWE screening and administrative tasks you mentioned, how do you verify or validate what it produces? Especially with that vulnerability detection model that's tuned for false positives?

User: The majority of the firmware will not contain CWEs, and with every patch, more CWEs are removed.  Consequently, the AI output will not be too much for a human to look through.  Usually the step of reviewing the output and deciding which CWEs to attack is divided among us.

AI: That's a practical approach - dividing up the AI-flagged potential vulnerabilities among team members for human review. It sounds like the volume is manageable even with the false positive bias.

We're about two-thirds of the way through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Have to think a lot for this one.  I guess like you alluded to earlier, if AI could somehow magically identify the hardware related vulnerabilities inside a component, that would be amazing.  It would also save a lot of effort and funding in not having to buy extra hardware and spend time reverse engineering for this purpose.  

I doubt that would work in real life, so maybe a more practical wish would be if AI could somehow help with any software related simulation.  Oftentimes, these simulations require VMs or entirely separate machines.  The VMs are often slow and clunky, and process is very much running an exploit, trying to understand why the exploit failed, and then revising and running again.  Then, repeating the experiments with different environments.   Perhaps if there was a way AI could predict point of failure in these exploits before we simulate them, that may help us.

AI: Those are both really thoughtful wishes - the hardware vulnerability identification would be like having x-ray vision for security flaws, and the exploit failure prediction could potentially save you a lot of those iterative cycles in the simulation environment.

That simulation process you described - running the exploit, diagnosing failures, revising, and repeating across different environments - sounds like it could be quite time-intensive.

Those are all my questions. Your perspectives on how AI has already been integrated into vulnerability detection workflows, and the clear boundaries you've identified between where AI can and can't help in hardware security research, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: One thing I actually do wonder is how AI is going to look in cyberphysical systems and how it could change the game. Drones are the particular cyber physical system we work with, but a lot of developers of the firmware and even the backend and UI systems for drones and similar devices are turning to AI to develop their software more efficiently.  A lot of folks even suspect that in the next 10 years, maybe all of this software will be produced by AI and human developers will have minimal involvement. My questions are if this would remove a lot of the CWEs we see right now, but also create new ones.  Or if maybe the game will become compromising the AI systems that write these firmware and software to include flaws and backdoors within (although this would be a much more difficult task and frankly much hard to study as a researcher).  It will be very interesting to see what happens in the next few years.  I am still new to this career and I wonder how different it will look by the team I reach the age of my mentors and professors.

AI: That's a really fascinating perspective - you're essentially looking at AI as potentially reshaping both sides of the cybersecurity equation. On one hand, AI-generated code might eliminate some human-introduced vulnerabilities, but on the other hand, it could create entirely new attack surfaces or classes of vulnerabilities we haven't seen before.

And that point about potentially targeting the AI systems themselves to introduce flaws during the code generation process is particularly intriguing - that would represent a completely different threat model than what you're working with today.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences and insights so openly. Your observations about how AI has already become integrated into your vulnerability detection workflow, the clear physical limitations you've identified, and especially your forward-looking thoughts about how AI might fundamentally change the cybersecurity landscape - all of this really helps us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real security research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready for the conversation, and I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I collaborate with other researchers who are either undergraduates, medical students, or physicians to write journal articles for medical journals. A recent project we worked on was a review paper on massive transfusion for trauma patients. The initials idea for this paper came about when working on other projects related to the topic, and we thought that it would be a good topic to focus on. It was a long process of research, looking through the literature, planning writing, and creating figures. The final output was a review that included tables and figures and summarized the current state of the literature.

AI: That sounds like a comprehensive project. Tell me more about that research and writing process - what were the main stages you went through from deciding on the topic to having that final review ready for submission?

User: The main stages was first drafting out an outline for what we wanted to talk about in this review. We made section headers and tried to organize our thoughts. We pulled from previous research and used a table that was going to go in one of our other papers but was cut because it was not as relevant to the main topic of that paper. Then, we started writing after getting our general thoughts down. Throughout this process we went back to the literature to find more articles and revised our initial outline to better reflect how our vision for the paper changed as time went on. Then we started focusing on creating the figures to summarize certain parts of our review and writing the abstract, conclusion, and keywords. We used EndNote to make the bibliography, and I formatted the article to fit the journal guidelines before submitting it.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - I can see how iterative that process was with the outline evolving as you dove deeper into the literature. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We used AI to help us find more articles in the literature. Often ChatGPT or OpenEvidence could find an article that is applicable to our paper that we were not able to find. We also used it to describe difficult topics or to summarize papers, but we made sure to not only trust the AI to do the thinking for us. We tried to find references to back up what the AI said, or asked to AI to find sources to back up its information.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found AI particularly useful for literature discovery and explanation. For those tasks where you did use AI - like finding articles or getting explanations of difficult topics - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of searching databases or other methods you might have used before.

User: We would usually go to AI if Google or PubMed was not able to find some good sources or if we just wanted to see if there were more out there. If there were no good explanations from sources that we could find, we would go to AI to explain it and then ask it for references to see if what it said was true.

AI: So it sounds like AI became your fallback when traditional search methods hit a wall. That makes a lot of sense.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the initial outlining, the actual writing, creating figures, or formatting - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I think we definitely might use AI in the future perhaps to propose an outline, but I think that at this point, it's just not that difficult to format a paper to a journal's specifications, and creating figures is something that is very specific and collaborative, so I just don't know how helpful AI could be for that. Overall, I just don't think it has been extremely difficult to do those things, so we have not use AI for them.

AI: That makes sense - if something isn't a bottleneck in your workflow, there's less incentive to change it. 

Going back to when you have used AI for finding articles and explanations, how do you verify or validate what it produces? You mentioned asking for references, but I'd love to hear more about your specific process for checking AI's work.

User: We ask the AI specifically for journal articles that we then read through to see if what it is saying makes sense. We check that paper's references before we decide to use it, as well.

AI: That's a thorough verification process. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I have one more forward-looking question for you.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would want AI to be 100% accurate so that it is completely trustable as a resource. As of now, I don't think I can always trust what the AI says. If it was completely accurate, I would want it to help with statistical analysis and to tell me what statistical tests to run or even how to design an experiment well.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the trust piece seems central to everything. Statistical analysis and experimental design are such critical areas where accuracy is paramount.

Those are all my questions. Your thoughts on how trust drives your decision-making with AI, and the way you've developed that systematic verification process, were particularly valuable insights. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a fallback when traditional methods hit limitations, and especially how you've developed that careful verification process of checking references and cross-validating information, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I worked on some research on the electrodeposition of nickel onto 3D printed polymers. The idea was first conceptualized by me due to the need of rapid manufacturing paired with the increased durability. First I reviewed many current and relevant research articles on various websites and decided on a path forward. I decided to use a fundamental Watts electrolyte formulation. This is where I implemented AI; I used it to synthesize all the current literature on Watts electrolyte formulations to find the most viable method of electrodeposition onto polymers coated in silver conductive paint. I then verified these statements and proceeded to inquire AI about ideal process parameters based on the electrolyte formulations. I think proceeded to conduct experiments with these formulations and operating parameters and perform testing on the produced specimens.

AI: That's fascinating research - the combination of 3D printing with electrodeposition for rapid manufacturing sounds really innovative. 

You mentioned using AI to synthesize the literature on Watts electrolyte formulations and then asking about ideal process parameters. Tell me more about how you decided to use AI for those specific parts rather than your traditional approach to literature review and parameter selection.

User: Well AI can more quickly skim through many literature results than would be possible by a single researcher in the same time frame. Also AI typically has access to more databases than I would think to look through. AI can more easily find key words and provide relevant articles that I can then further dive into to speed up the research process.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the speed and breadth of searching capabilities you're describing sound really valuable for getting through that initial literature screening.

When AI provided you with those relevant articles and process parameters, how did you go about verifying or validating what it had given you before moving forward with your experiments?

User: I would make a list of the values provided and go through the sources provided by AI and verify that they were those exact parameters with the correct deposition setup.

AI: So you'd cross-reference the AI's recommendations against the original sources to make sure the parameters and setups matched exactly - that's a thorough verification process.

Thinking about the other parts of your research - like the experimental design, the actual electrodeposition work, or analyzing your test results - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: I have used AI to do a cursory analysis on some figures I constructed and some microscope pictures but these tend to be less reliable due to there complex nature. I usually use AI in this instance to help lead me in a direction of inquiry before discovering more targeted findings. AI is good at coming up with an experimental design and I have used it for that in the past but most of my research has budget/time/specimen limits so the ""ideal"" design isn't always viable.

AI: That's really insightful - you're using AI as more of a starting point or direction-finder for complex analysis rather than relying on it for final conclusions. And the gap between ""ideal"" experimental design and practical constraints is something I hadn't considered.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I would love for it to be able to draw unique conclusions based on large datasets. For example providing AI with a large dataset on the hardness values of a cross section of electro deposited nickel and having it determine that the additive content saccharin was depleted during the deposition due to the decreasing hardness further from the substrate.

AI: That's a really compelling example - having AI make those kinds of sophisticated causal inferences from experimental data patterns, like connecting the hardness gradient to saccharin depletion during deposition. That would be quite a leap from where you're using it now.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as both a research accelerator and a starting point for inquiry, while being very deliberate about verification, were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI to accelerate the front-end research process while maintaining rigorous verification practices really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you balance leveraging AI's speed and breadth with the practical constraints of actual lab work was especially illuminating.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure let's go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I'm primarily a health services researcher interested in health care for older adults with on-going or complex care needs.  So I study ways that we can make the health system work better for older adults.  I'll use an example of a study that I published last year.  The title was [REDACTED].  The idea for the study came from the experiences of myself and my colleagues, who had noticed that many patients who were ALC (alternate level of care), which is a Canadian designation for those who did not need to stay in hospital for medical reasons but cannot be discharged home, were very near the end of life.  For most older adults near the end of life, the hospital is not the place that they want or need to be.  So we wanted to study how many adults 65+ who were designated ALC died within a short-time period after their designation, and if they received palliative care before they died.  Our hypothesis was that many died within a short time frame and did not receive any palliative care.  Like most of my research, this study used population-based heath administrative data.  So to begin the research process I started to application to access that data.  Once approved I directed one of our analysts in the data analysis and we had a number of team meetings to review and interpret the results.  Eventually when we were satisfied with the analysis, I begin to draft up the research paper.  I wrote the first draft myself, had my colleagues review it, and then edited the paper to produce the final version.  Then we submitted the paper to an academic journal, and have some minor edits based on peer review, it was published.

AI: That's a really compelling study - it sounds like you identified an important gap in end-of-life care for this vulnerable population. The process you described from initial observation through data analysis to publication sounds quite comprehensive.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I've primarily used AI tools during the writing process.  I've found LLMs to be very good at summarizing, so often use them to draft up abstracts or conclusions based on what I've previously written.  I've also used LLMs to help me re-write portions of the paper that I'm unhappy with or to proofread the paper.  Less often I have it write sections from scratch but I find the AI tools are not as useful without some of my own writing to go off of.  I also have tried using AI tools some in the literature searching portion of the project but also have found it less effective there.

AI: That's really helpful insight about where AI feels most useful versus less effective in your workflow. You mentioned that for the writing process, AI works better when it has your own writing to build from rather than creating sections from scratch.

For those writing tasks where you do use AI - like summarizing for abstracts or rewriting sections you're unhappy with - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach.

User: I had a colleague tell me about how useful he thought Chat-GPT was for his work, so much so he had bought a subscription.   I decided it was worth giving the tools a shot to see if they could save me some time.  Once I tried them out I was able to identify fairly quickly the areas where they were more or less helpful.

AI: That colleague recommendation really seemed to open the door for you to experiment. It sounds like you took a pretty methodical approach to testing where AI was and wasn't helpful once you started using it.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI much - like the data analysis phase or literature searching that you mentioned - what's kept you from trying it more extensively there?

User: I have tried it in areas like literature searching, but found it is not worth my time. I've tried some tools designed specifically for academic researchers, but still find they can be inaccurate.  I'm often asking very specific questions, but found that the tools are either not able to find the right papers or misinterpret the findings of the papers in answering my questions.  If I can't trust the tools completely then I can't use them for research because I need to be sure my citations are correct.

AI: That makes complete sense - accuracy is absolutely critical when you're building on existing research and need reliable citations. The trust factor seems really important here.

When you've used AI for the writing tasks where you do find it helpful - like drafting abstracts or rewriting sections - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: It's easier in those situations I've already got most of the paper written.  So I know whether the AI-produced abstract is good or not based on a simple read of it.   Often I edit the abstract a fair amount, but mostly the AI tools do a good job.  For re-writing sections there's often something about the section I don't like (i.e. flow between paragraphs) so ask the AI to re-write it with that in mind.  Because I know what I'm looking for it's easier to verify

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - having that existing foundation of your own work makes it much easier to evaluate whether the AI output is on target. You can spot-check it against what you already know should be there.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I would love for AI to be able to write up certain sections of my papers /grants using only an outline and key points from me.  I've tried this though and ultimately the sections don't sound like they are written in my voice.  They read too generic

AI: That ""voice"" issue is really interesting - it sounds like even when AI gets the content right, there's something about your personal writing style and perspective that doesn't come through. That authenticity seems important to you.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how trust and accuracy requirements vary so much across different research tasks were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: My only other point is that I think the tools have gotten quite a bit better over the past year or so and I hope they continue to improve.  Two years ago I wasn't using AI at all in my writing, but now I use it for nearly every task, even if for just proof-reading. You know I used to read my papers backwards to make sure I caught all the grammatical mistakes?  That's an effective but slow process.  The AI tools make proof-reading much faster.

AI: That's a great point about the rapid improvement - and what a perfect example with the proofreading! Going from reading papers backwards to having AI catch those errors must save you considerable time.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how the trust requirements differ between writing tasks versus literature searching, and how having your own foundation makes it easier to evaluate AI output, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The evolution you've described - from not using AI at all two years ago to now incorporating it into nearly every writing task - gives us valuable perspective on how these tools are actually integrating into research workflows.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: my most recent research project is about a diet app that takes in user's info such as their daily meals, comorbidities, sleep pattern and activity levels. Then it uses machine learning to predict the ideal amount of daily calories based on the user's info. i initially started it as an implementation project that only compares the calories with standard values but then i realized that a diet has to consider a person's comorbidities and activity levels.

AI: That's a really interesting evolution from a straightforward calorie comparison to something much more personalized and medically-informed. 

Can you tell me more about what that research process looked like day-to-day? How did you go from that initial implementation idea to developing the machine learning approach that factors in all these different health variables?

User: i initially built an app that takes in manual input from the users and saves it in a database. I also imported data from food databases and used those values to compare them to the user's input. I noticed a lot of irregularities and upon further research i discovered that exercise and metabolism significantly affects the results so i decided to take into account too. I started collecting info about the user's daily exercise and sleep. Then i decided to train a classification model on the info and predict the optimal calories

AI: That's a really thoughtful progression - you let the data and irregularities guide you toward a more sophisticated approach. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm curious about both the technical development side and any other parts of your research workflow.

User: i used FastAPI and React to build the app that takes in manual data. I used ChatGPT and PyTorch to build a classification model, replace missing values and also generate basic code saving me a lot of time. I also used it for matching the exercise data with the food log.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI became quite integral to several parts of your development process. 

For the classification model work specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use ChatGPT versus figuring things out through your traditional approach. What made you reach for that tool in those moments?

User: I decided to use chatgpt because it saved me a lot of time generating simple code. Although it could not go into depth, it did provide me enough to reduce the time taken for a simple task. if the problem was a bit more complicated that needed attention from me, I used the traditional approach

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as a time-saver for the more straightforward coding tasks while handling the complex problem-solving yourself.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like perhaps the deeper analytical work or specific domain expertise around nutrition and comorbidities - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I feel like i could not trust AI judgement on the analytic work because i wanted to be really sure about the final result. I preferred to be in control of the error analysis and comorbidity research

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making about control and trust, especially when it comes to health-related outcomes.

When you did use ChatGPT for the classification model and code generation, how did you verify or validate what it produced? What was your process for making sure those outputs were reliable?

User: i read and debugged the code instead of copy pasting it entirely. I also used logistic regression in scikit to compare the PyTorch model

AI: That's a smart validation approach - using both manual review and comparison with established methods. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: i would really appreciate if AI could conduct deep analysis. At the moment, i feel hesitant to trust AI with analysis so I just use it to generate simple code and models. It might take a while for AI to reach human-level personal analysis but it would definitely help a lot.

AI: That's really insightful - you're identifying this gap between where AI is useful now versus where you'd need it to be for the deeper analytical work that requires your domain expertise and judgment.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a productivity tool while maintaining control over the critical analytical decisions were particularly valuable. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining personal control over critical health-related analysis really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's clear you've developed a thoughtful approach to integrating these tools where they add value while recognizing the boundaries of where human expertise remains essential, especially in domains with real-world health implications.

User: yep sounds good lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently worked on a project in the field of molecular physics. I used an existing density partitioning method and modified it in order to calculate certain quantum properties more accurately. It began with a literature review - I read all the new research and also lots of the older stuff again. Then I had the idea for the project, what I wanted to do, what methods I would use in theory. Then to make the ideas reality I got on the computer and started by collecting a small sample of(15 small molecules) data from the existing density partitioning method and looking at those in depth. Then I wrote up a bit of code to test a method I had been reading a lot about online - ran that on some molecules and checked with datasets that I was getting the right numbers. With those parts figured, I was able to start building my new model which combined and modified aspects of both of the existing models I had tested. This was the longest process of trial and error until I finally got numbers which were consistent with expectations. Once I had collected data for my 15 small molecules, I analysed that looked for trends make sure all is good then extended my data set to another 15 slightly larger molecules. Following that conducted some secondary studies of areas I would like to explore more... Commenced by completing presentations getting feedback modifying report and writing up for review

AI: That's a really thorough overview of your process - from literature review all the way through to writing up for review. It sounds like there were several distinct phases involving both theoretical work and hands-on coding and analysis.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Yes, a few places. I actually used AI tools quite a lot throughout this process. In the literature review portion I used AI tools to quickly scan any papers before I read them to check how relevant they are to my research (sometimes the titles and abstracts alone are a bit deceiving). Though, I found I didn't feel very trusting sometimes and would often worry the AI had missed a nuance in the paper which would be essential to me - so my use of the AI in the field was only brief. I often tried to use AI chats to help me with the brainstorming process - bouncing ideas of, asking for advice on certain aspects. But my area of research seemed to be just too novel/niche/difficult (?) to get any valuable help from the AI and often just ended up wasting a lot of my time whilst I tried to ""set the scene"" and explain the concepts we were working with. So, at this stage, was still a bit of a bust but I kept trying. I also tried using it to spot things in big groups of data for me, but the accuracy was a bit too low for it to be helpful. My favourite use it turned out for the AI tools was when writing up my final report. Trying to put pages of complex mathematical formula into Latex is a pretty long job. Screenshots of the equations into an AI chatbot was all it took to get immediate output of the latex I needed and really cut the method section of my paper in half. That was a great use.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you found a sweet spot with the LaTeX conversion, but ran into some challenges in other areas. You mentioned that with the brainstorming, your research area seemed ""too novel/niche/difficult"" for the AI to provide valuable help.

Tell me more about what happened when you tried to ""set the scene"" and explain the concepts to the AI during brainstorming - what made that feel like it was wasting your time?

User: Yes sure. My research was all about subtle nuances. I was studying properties of atoms in molecules. To the untrained eye the method I was using as my start point already looked like it was correctly calculating the properties I was looking for. In reality there was an entire piece of the puzzle missing from the existing data that was not well recorded in any online sources. I tasked myself with finding a method to put those missing pieces back in, which required a method which was extremely different to existing works. I modified a model which usually has an entirely different role, to fit my purpose. No matter how I explained this to the AI systems I could not effectively communicate why this was necessary - it just could not understand. I would give all the scientific background I could, lay out my exact plan and reason for the study and it would go one of two ways. 1. It would retort with an answer which was not even close to what I was asking or 2. It would reply something which made me feel it understood just to reply to a follow up question that demonstrated it was just a fluke. You can image how that would waste a lot of time.

AI: That really paints a clear picture - it sounds incredibly frustrating to spend time laying out all that scientific background only to get responses that showed the AI fundamentally didn't grasp the subtlety of what you were trying to achieve. The fact that it would sometimes seem to understand and then reveal it didn't with follow-up questions must have been particularly maddening.

For the LaTeX conversion task where you found AI really helpful - how did you decide to try AI for that versus your traditional approach of manually coding the equations?

User: To be honest, I just thought what could go wrong? I had seen people using the AI tools for coding help with some success which gave me the idea. I figured I would try giving it an equation, pasting it into Latex and generating and seeing what happened. When it worked my first trial I knew this would be how I would do it from now on. There are some tasks which you could get AI to do - but I wouldn't - because I simply enjoy doing themself, and I suppose I also believe I could do a much better job than the AI could (i.e. writing up the publication - I prefer my own writing style). And there are some jobs like this latex where you can't really say you enjoy it - it's laborious. Also, it makes no difference about who did that task, it doesn't look better because a human wrote it in - it's the same, I would've written it up the same way. So really it only saves time so of course you would do it.

AI: That makes perfect sense - you identified a task that was purely mechanical with no creative or interpretive value, so there was really no downside to trying AI for it. It sounds like you have a clear sense of which tasks you value doing yourself versus which ones are just tedious necessities.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the core model development and analysis phases - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: In terms of the core model development I did use it here and there for bits of coding / debugging help. But I felt if I let the AI tools do too much of the coding I would kind of lose sight of what was going on if that makes sense? If something is going wrong in my own code I feel I always know where to start when trying to fix it, but if the code mostly came from an AI tool I would feel a bit. out of my depth where to start. I also came from a pure physical science background and only transitioned to the computational world a couple years ago so I also like to take to chance to practice where I can. The analysis phase was a big no to me to receive the AI help. It didn't feel worth the chance of errors. I knew if I was taking on something it had told me I would have to spend time checking every aspect to be safe - so it didn't feel too worth it. I also knew that I had insights on the science that the AI tools just wouldn't. So it felt like asking a first year undergraduate student for help writing a PhD thesis - not really worth it

AI: That analogy of asking a first-year undergraduate to help with a PhD thesis really captures it well. You mentioned that even if you did use AI for analysis, you'd have to spend time checking every aspect to be safe.

When you've used AI for tasks like the LaTeX conversion or debugging help, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: The latex conversion is super easy to check which is why I loved it for that - paste it into latex, recompile and if it compiles how you wanted it then it's done. If it's not you just delete it and try again - no time taken at all. Same with the debugging - if I understand its reasoning and like the fix I'll just try it and if we run without errors I'm happy and we move on. That's why I like it for those kind of tasks because they're more of if it works it works kind of tasks.

AI: That's a great distinction - tasks where the verification is immediate and obvious versus ones where errors might be subtle or harder to detect. It sounds like you've developed a pretty clear framework for when AI is useful versus when it's not worth the risk.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be that early brainstorming / bouncing off ideas phase. I mean that's why I had so much to say about that - because I desperately wanted it to work and be a partner for me. My field is niche, and because of that a bit lonely when it comes to sharing ideas. I know my supervisor, and that is pretty much the extent of the audience I can discuss my work with and have understanding from the partner. Obviously I could attempt to start an email conversation with someone in another institution which may eventually blossom into someone I can converse with regularly, but that is not necessarily a small feat. I would love an AI which could feel like a valuable research partner. An AI with human-like ideas and thought processes. Or even one that could just bring something new to the table - they could be distinctly non-human in their reasoning as long as it was a fresh perspective. I want it to feel like a two way conversation - rather than a one sided almost teacher to student like relationship where the student refuses to learn.

AI: That longing for a true research partner really comes through - the idea of having something that could offer a fresh perspective, whether human-like or distinctly non-human, as long as it brings something genuinely new to the conversation. The isolation of working in such a niche field makes that need for intellectual collaboration even more acute.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on finding that sweet spot between leveraging AI for mechanical tasks while maintaining control over the creative and analytical work were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Nope I think that's all. glad it was useful

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the loneliness of niche research and your desire for AI to be more of a true intellectual partner really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you've carved out specific use cases where verification is straightforward while being appropriately cautious about areas requiring deep domain expertise shows a really thoughtful approach to AI integration.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"
science_0075,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today - I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions - I'm ready to start.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I work in astrophysics. A recent project of mine involved a study of the central supermassive black hole in a nearby active galactic nucleus. The process began by writing an observing proposal to use a particular space-based observatory (in this case, XMM-Newton) in order to meet my scientific objectives. This was successful and, later, the observation was performed and I received the data. I analysed this large dataset along with my collaboration group, spreading out the work according to the expertise of the respective team members. We used some of the latest models and theories from the scientific literature in order to test various scenarios for the outflowing wind from this black hole. Eventually, we obtained scientifically interesting results from the data, which I wrote up for publication in an astrophysical journal.

AI: That's fascinating - thank you for walking me through that process. It sounds like quite a comprehensive journey from proposal to publication.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Four ways that I implemented AI immediately come to mind:

- Given the huge size of the dataset (millions of individual 'events'), I used AI to help manipulate the dataset in a more efficient manner. For example, I used it to create time series in various different formats (binning, wavelength band, etc) in order to analyse the variability.

- I used AI to help summarise the key findings of long research papers in the literature. This helped me to speed up the process of performing a literature review and placing my results into context.

- I used AI to help with data visualisation. I used it to help create plots and graphs in various different forms, predominantly to provide me with inspiration for the final plots and figures I would use in the publication.

- I also used AI to help with the writing process of the paper. I used it to help me word complicated sections and to describe complex astrophysical models. This was more of a 'guiding hand' to give me useful ideas for phrasing, clarity, and structure.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you've integrated AI across multiple stages of your research process. Let me dig deeper into one of those areas.

For the data manipulation work you mentioned - dealing with those millions of individual events - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: For the data manipulation, the crucial point is that I wanted to perform a new type of analysis on these data. This required the data to be formatted in various different ways for which I did not have any existing code written. So I would have needed to write a new piece of complex code from scratch. This is why I turned to AI as it helped to speed up the process and work more efficiently.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - so it was really about efficiency for a new type of analysis you hadn't done before.

Thinking about the other parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: For some areas of my research, I already have existing code written that I am highly confident in using. Secondly, I use a wide variety of astrophysical models when fitting my data - but many of these are written and published by other members of the scientific community and there is no need to modify them. In essence, for some core parts of my work, I already have access to an appropriate software suite and catalogue of models and there is no requirement to use AI in this aspect of my research.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - you're already well-equipped in those areas. 

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Let me ask about the areas where you have used AI: When you've used AI for something like literature summarization or writing assistance, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: For writing assistance, I already know the essence of what I want to say. So I can verify this quite quickly by reading the output and checking whether I agree with what it has written. The point here is that I use it for inspiration and ideas, but I read all output carefully and only use something if I agree with it.

The same applies for summarising text. I still read the original text myself and so I already know the essence of what should be produced. For anything that involves numbers or mathematical formulae, I always check these carefully by hand as I think this is an area where mistakes are more likely to slip through.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using it as inspiration while maintaining your own expertise as the ultimate filter. The distinction you make about being especially careful with numbers and mathematical formulae is particularly interesting.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I really wish AI was better equipped to help with interpreting and analysing results and/or the output of my analysis. It often seems to fail in its scientific reasoning leading to interpretations and discussion points that range from missing key points to being downright wrong. I wish I could provide AI with the output of some analysis and, given the context, have it interpret it in an accurate and reliable manner.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - the gap between AI being helpful with mechanics and structure versus the deeper scientific reasoning and interpretation that's at the heart of your work.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions, and your perspectives on how you balance AI efficiency with scientific rigor have been particularly valuable. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Two issues that I have concerns about are hidden biases and reproducibility (unseen algorithms/pipelines, etc). These are two hurdles that currently prevent me from feeling reassured enough to use AI more than I currently do.

AI: Those are really important concerns that cut to the heart of scientific integrity. Thank you for raising those - the issues of hidden biases and reproducibility are fundamental to maintaining trust in scientific work.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about using AI as an efficiency tool while maintaining rigorous verification processes, and particularly your point about the current limitations in scientific reasoning and interpretation, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real astrophysical research. The concerns you raised about biases and reproducibility also highlight some critical areas that need attention as AI tools continue to evolve in scientific contexts.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective as someone actively using AI in cutting-edge astrophysics research has been incredibly valuable.

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for your time and thoughtful responses. Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your ongoing research on active galactic nuclei!"
science_0076,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today - I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm good to go.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My entire project is currently an externally funded RAD, so I'll focus on a smaller trade study that was part of it to be able to speak about the whole process. As part of the project, we need to be able to synchronize log file time metadata between 12-13 FPGA evaluation boards that each have three network cores on them, so 36-39 network cores in all. These log timestamps need to be within 4ns of each other, based on a 500 MHz clock. Some kind of HDL module was needed to make sure they can be synchronized to a differential master signal being fed to each.

We had an arbitrary waveform generator with 16 differential outputs, that in theory would have sub-50ps in difference synchronized rise time on enable and during operation. The trade study involved creating a low overhead counter correction module that would take in that synchronizing pulse signal and compare the number of clock cycles between each pulse that it measured to the ideal of a perfect 500MHz clock. This way we would know how far off the local clock on that board is from the ideal and be able to adjust a running counter to a count that essentially emulates if it were counting off an actual ""ideal"" clock.

AI: That's a fascinating synchronization challenge - the precision requirements with that 4ns window across so many network cores sounds quite demanding.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used it to research the capabilities of the AWG we had since the datasheet was written by Tektronix and they're not the best at writing those, so I fed it into our company hosted AI to evaluate my assumptions. I used it to partially create the general structure of my slides in a monthly update presentation to the program managers and directors of the org the program is in. I used AI to do administrative tasks like keeping track of hex conversion calculations and sanity checking those calculations since they were tedious and I could potentially slip up.

AI: That's interesting - you used AI for quite a range of tasks from technical analysis to presentation structure to calculations. 

Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for evaluating that AWG datasheet.

User: I had already read the datasheet before so I had some assumptions that I thought I knew about the AWG, but from talking to coworkers no one had ever verified that the AWG was rated for that use case. I fed the AI the pdf file of the datasheet and asked it to confirm my assumptions and check if anything would derail the use case. Of course I also did actual instrument testing.

AI: So you used AI as a way to get a second perspective on your interpretation of the datasheet before moving to the instrument testing. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I work in classified environments and per our DOD contact on the contract and company policy, anything CUI+ may not be fed into AI models. I have not fed you any CUI or classified information.

AI: That makes complete sense - the security constraints clearly define hard boundaries around where AI can and can't be used in your work environment.

For the tasks where you could use AI - like the datasheet analysis or hex calculations - when you get results back from the AI, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I do the traditional manual calculations, for example on the hex calculations I did manually on a notepad.

AI: So you're essentially using AI as a computational assistant but still doing the verification work yourself manually - that's a good safety check.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Debugging, easily. Debugging in simulation and hardware is a massive headache for FPGA designs as the further into the design flow you get, the more variables are present especially once you bring in UVM-like verification. Debugging an FPGA project requires a lot of domain knowledge, toolchain knowledge, and then project specific knowledge. Something as simple as a choice of which GTY quad to use you would at minimum need to read documentation on the reasoning behind the choice. Sometimes it's never written down. An AI with sufficient knowledge of design/debugging, the toolchain, and the ""codebase"" as it were for the design would be very helpful in the debugging process.

AI: That's a really compelling use case - the combination of domain expertise, toolchain specifics, and institutional knowledge that debugging requires sounds like exactly where AI could add significant value if it had access to all that context.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how security constraints create clear boundaries for AI use, and especially your insights about the debugging bottleneck, were particularly illuminating. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Just a comment, AI needs to become significantly better at mathematical calculations to be useful for research in general. The main two issues are that models don't actually know if they're calculating it right from an actual arithmetic perspective, and if they do they sometimes just forget things such as being told to use a particular approach a few rounds ago. I know some companies are integrating scripting languages that allow calculation (like python) into their ""heavy"" models but it's still an issue.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the combination of arithmetic accuracy issues and the context/instruction drift you're describing sounds like fundamental barriers to deeper AI integration in technical research work.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the security boundaries creating clear use cases, and especially your point about mathematical reliability being a prerequisite for broader research adoption, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me, and I have no questions to ask at the moment.

AI: Perfect, thank you! Let's dive right in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your research background. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Are you for asking a research project I've worked on with or without AI?

AI: Great question! I'd like you to just pick any recent research project that comes to mind - whether it involved AI or not. I'm interested in understanding your natural research process first, and then we can explore where AI has or hasn't fit into that workflow.

So just think of a project that's representative of the kind of work you do, and walk me through how it unfolded from start to finish.

User: Recently, I was working through a challenging set of electromagnetism problems for my University Physics II course containing Coulomb's law calculations, vector analysis, and gravitational field problems that we quite complex. Rather than struggling through them alone, I started using tools like Gemini and NotebookLM to help verify my work and understand the methodology. 

What I discovered is the AI would frequently make calculation errors, especially on multi-step problems. So I developed an approach where I'd work through each problem myself first, then use AI to check my process. When we disagreed, I'd have the AI show me its complete step-by-step work, and I'd identify where it went wrong and correct it.

This iterative process actually strengthened my understanding significantly. Instead of just getting answers, I was constantly validating methodology and catching errors - both mine and the AI's. It forced me to really understand the underlying concepts because I had to be able to identify when the AI made mistakes.

I use a similar approach in my Java programming class, where I'll use AI to help debug code or verify my logic, but I always review and understand what it's suggesting before implementing anything.

The result is that I'm much more confident tackling difficult technical problems. I have this powerful tool to help me work through complex calculations and check my reasoning, but I'm still doing the critical thinking and learning. It's enhanced my problem-solving process without replacing my need to truly understand the material.

AI: That's a really interesting approach you've developed - using AI as a verification partner rather than just for answers. I'm curious about that decision-making moment you described.

When you're working on a new problem, tell me more about how you decide whether to tackle it completely on your own first versus bringing AI in at different stages of the process.

User: I always start by working though problems completely on my own first. This helps me identify what I can actively recall and which concepts I genuinely understand versus what I might just think I know. I want to see how far I can get using my own knowledge before bringing in any external help. 

Once I hit a clear roadblock, whether its a calculation I can't figure out or a concept I'm not grasping, that's when I use AI. But I make sure to be strategic about it. I don't just ask for the answer, I ask to help me understand the specific step where I got stuck.

What I find that is helpful, is that I keep track of these problem areas. I'll make notes about the concepts or types of questions that consistently trip me up, and then I use notes as sort of a study guide to create targeted study sessions with NotebookLM. I'll feed it textbook sections or class notes on those specific topics and have it generate practice problems, explanations, and concept videos focused on my weak points.

This approach means I'm not becoming dependent on AI to do my thinking for me. Instead, I'm using it to identify gaps in my understanding and then actively work to fill those gaps. The AI becomes a diagnostic tool as much as a learning aid.

AI: That diagnostic approach is fascinating - you're essentially using AI to map your own knowledge gaps. I'm really curious about something you mentioned earlier about the AI making calculation errors.

Tell me more about how you've learned to identify when the AI is making mistakes, especially in those complex multi-step physics problems.

User: I noticed the AI tended to make more errors whenever a problem had multiple parts, more than 3 but in my case more than 8 steps, from interpreting the concept to writing the correct expressions, finding magnitudes, simplifying, and then applying everything together to find the solution to the final exercise of the question. When I'd submit a screenshot of several parts at once, the AI often missed simple sign conventions, gave numeric answers when only the expression was requested, or even repeated the same wrong result I'd gotten. But when I provided a screenshot of just on part I'd struggled with, its accuracy improved significantly.

Even then, it sometimes insisted on incorrect answers I'd already flagged, as if it was rising to offer a solution rather methodically working through the math. My takeaway is that it doesn't reliably track which of its suggestions have been ruled out and possibly lacks the persistent memory or guardrails to avoid repeating mistakes.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how AI performance changes with problem complexity and scope. You've clearly developed some sophisticated strategies for working with these limitations.

Thinking about the parts of your coursework where you haven't used AI - are there areas where you've deliberately chosen not to experiment with it, and what's driven those decisions?

User: That's a great question. I set clear boundaries around AI to preserve essential learning steps.
When I'm first encountering new topics in electromagnetics or Java fundamentals, I work through textbook examples and exercises entirely on my own. That initial struggle builds problem-solving intuition and a solid foundation.

I also avoid AI during actual practice tests or timed quizzes; I rely solely on my own recall so I know I can perform under exam conditions.

Once I've mastered the basics, I do turn to AI (especially NotebookLM) to generate targeted study materials. I prompt it to create practice problems, flashcards, and concept summaries using active-memorization techniques tailored to my weak areas. But I only use those AI-generated materials for studying, never during the practice tests themselves.

Similarly, in my Java class, I practice debugging and logic checks independently until I can spot simple errors on my own. Then I'll use AI to help verify more complex code segments and reinforce my understanding.

Overall, AI enters my workflow only after I've given a problem my best effort—it reinforces and accelerates my learning without replacing the core discovery and problem-solving process.

AI: You've really developed a thoughtful framework for balancing independent learning with AI assistance. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'd love to explore one more aspect of how you use these tools.

When you do use AI for verification or to check your work, how do you actually validate what it's telling you? Walk me through your process for deciding whether to trust or question what the AI produces.

User: When I use AI to verify my work, I follow a simple three-step check. First I compare its solution to my own notes or the textbook. Next I rework the key steps by hand to see if I reach the same result. Then I submit the AI's answer in the online coursework to confirm it gives a correct result. If it does, I ask the AI to walk me through its method step by step without giving the final answer. If it's wrong, I point out the errors and ask it to try again. Only when I can reproduce its solution myself do I trust it. This process helps me catch mistakes and ensures I understand every step.

AI: That's a really systematic verification process - it sounds like you've become quite skilled at being a critical evaluator of AI output.

For our final question: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your coursework that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I wish AI could provide truly interactive visualizations and guided thought experiments for any course I'm taking (currently Calculus III, University Chemistry, Java, or Physics II). For example, I'd like to adjust variables in real time and see step-by-step illustrations of how those changes affect the outcome. Right now, AI gives me equations and solutions, but it doesn't bridge the gap between the math or code and the underlying intuition. Having those interactive tools would help me catch misconceptions quickly and build a much stronger conceptual understanding.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on developing that systematic verification process and using AI as a diagnostic tool for your own learning gaps were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your coursework that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I do not believe so.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that three-step verification process and strategically using AI to identify and fill knowledge gaps rather than replace your own thinking really help us understand the nuances of how AI can fit into rigorous academic work.

Your approach of maintaining clear boundaries while still leveraging AI's strengths shows a level of intentionality that I think will be really valuable for us to understand.

Thanks again for your time today!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your Physics II, Calculus III, Chemistry, and Java courses!"
science_0078,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent research project began as a follow-up paper expanding on a previous one. Therefore we already had a good scope and fundamentals for the paper, and could begin formalizing everything right away. This saved a lot of the usual startup time for a paper and made the process very straight forward

AI: That sounds like a nice advantage to build on previous work! Tell me more about what ""formalizing everything"" looked like in practice - what were the main steps you went through from that point to your final output?

User: Formalizing involved creating a new problem setting to use to extend our model. Our original paper was an inference problem, and we wanted to expand it to a learning setting. This involved figuring out how our data was going to be generated, and what types of assumptions we were going to make about it. Once we made those decisions we figured out how our previous model could be adapted to help solve this new problem, and what guarantees we could give on the performance. These theoretical guarantees, along with an algorithm, were the main portions of our final paper

AI: That's a really clear progression from problem formulation to theoretical analysis. So you moved from the initial data generation and assumptions, through model adaptation, to developing performance guarantees and the final algorithm.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We did not use any AI tools for this paper, but have experimented in using them to identify relevant related works. Similar to a quarriable encyclopedia

AI: Interesting - so you've tried AI for literature review work but didn't use it for this particular paper. Tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for identifying related works.

User: For this paper many of the related works were similar to the previous paper so using AI felt unnecessary. It is most helpful when our work has possible analogs in area of research that we aren't as familiar with. Some of these topics have been explored by other fields that we may not think to look at

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a bridge to discover relevant work in unfamiliar fields that you might not think to search in otherwise. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the theoretical work, algorithm development, or performance guarantees you mentioned - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Ai hasn't shown me that it is reliable enough for work that is of core importance to the paper. For things like editing, related works, or gather background information mistakes are relatively unimportant compared to the theoretical proof or something more central to the novelty of the paper.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making between peripheral tasks where mistakes have lower stakes versus core contributions where reliability is crucial. 

When you have used AI for those lower-stakes tasks like finding related works, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: We always follow links to the underlying research papers to verify the claims

AI: That verification step makes perfect sense - treating AI suggestions as starting points rather than final answers.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Being able to present our work in simpler terms for a more general audience. My work is theoretical, and sometimes it hard to concisely get a point across. This can make papers unapproachable for even other, not as theoretical, researchers in the same field. Bridging this gap from theory to the appliers of the theory is a difficult, but important step

AI: That's such a thoughtful point - the challenge of translating complex theoretical work so it's accessible to practitioners who could actually apply it. It sounds like you see real value in making that bridge, but it's genuinely difficult work.

Tell me more about what makes that translation so challenging for you right now.

User: When you do work deep into a single research topic it is easy to lose sight of how much background other researchers in the field might have. We are so engrained in these topics that they are second nature, but other people might not see it that way. This leads to a disconnect in how we are writing things vs how they are being read. Also, page limits on conference papers always lead to a tradeoff between readability and space

AI: That's really insightful - you're describing both the curse of knowledge problem and the practical constraints of academic publishing. It sounds like you're constantly navigating that tension between including enough detail for rigor versus making it digestible within space limits.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how reliability requirements shape where you'll use AI, and especially your thoughts on the communication challenge between theoretical and applied researchers, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No thank you

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how the stakes of different research tasks influence your willingness to use AI really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you made between using AI for discovery tasks versus core theoretical contributions, and your vision for AI helping bridge the theory-to-practice communication gap, were especially valuable perspectives.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your research background. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: As a researcher, my process starts with taking new ideas that are discussed on social media (especially regarding AI). One research project ive worked on for a few years, and is not nearly finished, is how humans quantize complex topics into levels of abstraction, such as high level overviews, mid-level analogies, and lower-level details, and testing individuals with quizzes to measure cognitive load.
It usually starts with a hypothesis, then the research phase begins, where LLMs are used to locate sources and research papers on the topic.
Next, the hypothesis is refined into a smaller idea that can be measured through testing.
Finally, a basic quiz is designed, and there is a section at the end to measure how it made them feel, or if it made them stressed.

AI: That's a fascinating area of research - the way humans process information at different levels of abstraction sounds really complex to study. 

You mentioned that LLMs are part of your research phase to locate sources and papers. Tell me more about how you use them for that - what does that process actually look like when you sit down to research?

User: It usually starts with a few example prompts that are centered around the hypothesis, and I try to measure the most realistic ideas against the hardest to prove. From there, I will design a prompt that fits the questions I would like to ask and usually spend time modifying it and sending it until I get my desired result. I frequently use chain of thought prompts that I come up with before starting a conversation, such as follow-up questions or asking the model to rank the trustworthiness of articles.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've developed quite a systematic approach with the chain of thought prompts and trustworthiness rankings. 

When you're in that process of refining your prompts and getting results back from the LLM, how do you decide whether to use AI versus going directly to traditional database searches or other research methods you might have used before?

User: When I first started being a researcher, I used databases that my college offered to find relevant articles. The database search was often more time-consuming than using Google Scholar because it was keyword dependent. When ChatGPT got access to searching the internet, I immediately adopted it because it could provide links based on entire paragraphs describing my hypothesis or research ideas, instead of relying on keywords.

AI: That shift from keyword-based searching to being able to describe your hypothesis in full paragraphs sounds like a real game-changer for efficiency. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the hypothesis refinement, quiz design, or analyzing how participants felt about the cognitive load - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas, or have you experimented there too?

User: I have not used LLMs to design my quizzes, but I have occasionally used them to brainstorm because the questions I ask are short and direct, and I find that LLMs quickly become wordy or fail to distill complex ideas into short questions. The writing quality is not good enough, but sI could see how it can get better. I am not sure how to implement AI into asking the participants about their cognitive load, but I just now imagined creating an LLM-inspired questionnaire that is more interactive than my pre-written questions being useful in the future.

AI: That's a really perceptive observation about the wordiness issue - it sounds like you've hit on something important about where AI currently falls short for your specific needs.

When you do use LLMs for research and finding sources, how do you go about verifying or validating what they produce? You mentioned asking them to rank trustworthiness of articles - tell me more about your process there.

User: I do not usually use the text excerpts that LLMs give summarizing the articles, and instead I create a list of sources in a notepad that I will later read through, and if there is an article that I might use, I will independently verify the source, such as its authors or if it was done at a university. I currently see LLM's as a type of search engine for finding articles that produce a higher rate of relevant articles compared to using Google Scholar. I do notice that the models will frequently find links that are not at all on topic, or have titles that sound like they could be relevant, but after reading, are not.

AI: That's a smart approach - using LLMs essentially as a more sophisticated search engine while maintaining your own verification standards. The issue you mention about titles sounding relevant but not actually being on topic when you read them is really telling.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I wish that it wouldn't decide to be completely dismissive of early-stage ideas, or express as much criticism about novel idea's even if I later decide they are unrealistic. I will sometimes need to modify prompts to tell the model to treat my questions as theoretical because it will often cite psychology studies or ethical concerns, when the questions being asked in my research are harmless and more speculative than factual.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like the AI's tendency to be overly cautious or critical can actually stifle the kind of exploratory thinking that's so important in early research stages. The fact that you have to specifically tell it to treat things as theoretical just to get it to engage with your ideas sounds frustrating.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a sophisticated search tool while maintaining rigorous verification standards, and especially your point about AI being too dismissive of novel ideas in early research phases, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I believe one of the most helpful advancements LLMs could use for my research is maintaining the level of insight and intelligence it has through prompts 2-4, because I have noticed that I frequently must restart conversations, or edit the second prompt, because it is noticeably dumber and less focused the more prompts I use.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the degradation in quality over longer conversations is something that could significantly impact research workflows where you need sustained, deep engagement with complex ideas.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about using AI as an enhanced search engine while maintaining your own verification standards, the challenges with AI being overly cautious about novel ideas, and especially that observation about conversation quality degrading over time - these really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No all good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I worked on developing organic semiconductor solar cells for underwater use. This began at a meeting at the marine biology centre where they were looking for ways to power small gps trackers for animals. Solar cells naturally fit this niche but standard Si cells are not efficient underwater due to the reduced amount of red light. Organic cells are much more efficient and can be tailored to work at different depths. I started with a literature review to find promising looking materials then fabricated films in a clean room before performing photoinduced absorption spectroscopy to test for charge generation. The most promising materials where then turned into functioning cells and tested under AM1.5G and a simulated underwater spectrum. I then wrote up my results.

AI: That's fascinating work - the connection between marine biology needs and materials science is really compelling. You've outlined a clear process from identifying the problem through to testing and documentation.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I experimented using AI tools in the literature review stage

AI: Tell me more about that. What specifically did you use AI for during your literature review, and how did that work out for you?

User: I used it to find organic semiconductors with specific optical properties that would be required for a good cell. This meant absorbing strongly between 300-650nm and a band gap of approximatly 2 eV

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to search for materials with those specific optical criteria. For that literature search task, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding those organic semiconductors.

User: I ended up using a manual search as the AI was unable to find good materials and instead only suggested common materials that would not be suitable

AI: That's a really valuable insight - so the AI defaulted to common materials rather than finding the specific ones that matched your optical criteria. Tell me more about what happened when you tried the AI approach - what did you ask it to do, and what kinds of materials was it suggesting that weren't suitable?

User: I asked it to find organic semiconductors that were strongly absorbing in the 300-650 nm region with a bandgap around 2 eV. It suggested common materials such as PIDT-BT and MEH-PPV that did not match my criteria

AI: I see - so it was giving you well-known materials from the literature but they didn't actually meet your specific absorption and bandgap requirements. That must have been frustrating when you had such precise criteria.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the fabrication, the spectroscopy testing, the cell testing, or the writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: The fabrication method used is standard so required no design, in the other areas I was hesitant to use AI after the previous bad experience as it would be harder to check its work for a mistake and my group had several experts I could ask for guidance.

AI: That makes complete sense - that initial experience really shaped how you viewed AI's reliability for the rest of your project. It sounds like trust became a key factor, especially when you had domain experts readily available.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: when you did try using AI for that literature search, how were you planning to verify or validate what it suggested to you?

User: I used it the winter of 2024, I asked the AI to link me papers describing the materials so that I could varify the absorption spectra and band gap myself before purchasing them.

AI: That's a smart verification approach - asking for the actual papers so you could check the data yourself. What happened when you asked for those paper links? Were you able to get the references you needed to verify the materials it was suggesting?

User: Yes they all worked fine  they just were not materials that matched my stated properties

AI: Ah, so the AI was giving you legitimate, accessible papers - it just wasn't understanding or properly filtering for your specific optical requirements. That's a really important distinction.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Literature reviews as they are tedious and time consuming to perform but it is relatively easy and quick for me to verify their findings by hand.

AI: That's really insightful - you still see the potential value in AI for literature reviews despite your experience. It sounds like the verification aspect is key for you - being able to quickly check the work makes it worth trying again.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on how that initial experience with AI not matching your specific criteria really shaped your approach to the rest of your research workflow was particularly illuminating. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI's inability to properly filter for specific material properties affected your trust and willingness to use it in other parts of your workflow really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The fact that you'd still be interested in using it for literature reviews - but with proper verification steps - shows how scientists are thinking practically about where AI might add value.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then. 

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: As an example, part of a recent project I worked on involved an aquatic drone that was meant to help detect and monitor invasive species in fresh bodies of water. Since the drone would be connected to university research and contain important data, the team needed to make sure they knew what kind of signals were being transmitted via each of the wires - This is where I came in. They had a mystery wire in the controller and had no idea what its purpose was or its signal. 

From here, I do a preliminary search to gather loose information about whatever malfunction/problem/etc. the device is experiencing, and generally end up reading a lot of User Manuals. Then I come in and mess around with stuff, in this case I brought in a grounded oscilloscope initially to see if I could get a read. After messing around in the lab for awhile running diagnostics, it's then back to searching, but at this point the topic usually requires a thorough literature review. Then the diagnostic/literature review cycle repeats until ultimately (hopefully) a resolution is reached. This is often in the form of a ""fix"" or in this case, by resolving the frequency of the wire's signal. Does that answer your question?

AI: That's a really helpful example - I can see how that diagnostic process involves a lot of iterative cycles between hands-on testing and research. The mystery wire investigation sounds like detective work!

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: While my research/work tends to involve a lot of lab-based tasks, a good amount of my work is conducting literature reviews. The initial stage of gathering the manuals I need is easy, feeding AI the manual and telling me to pick out any part of it that involves specific *concepts*, not just words or phrases, is something I've tried and continue to try. AI does...okay at this. One thing AI can be really great at in this stage is scouring web forums, like reddit, for posts that are related to very specific topics - its recognition for ""similar concepts"" vs ""similar words or phrasing"" can really help narrow down some tidbits from other's peoples' totally separate problems to piece together the solution to the very unique problems I deal with.  I also use it to help me gather sources to review, particularly scientific papers - however, this is kind of a crapshoot most of the time.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found AI helpful for that conceptual pattern matching, especially in forums where people might describe similar issues in completely different ways. 

Tell me more about why gathering scientific papers with AI is ""kind of a crapshoot"" - what happens when you try to use it for that?

User: AI adores hallucinating the relationships in sources between Author and Title. Particularly, it really likes to take real scientist's names and attribute papers to them either in their field, or adjacent fields, that *do not exist. *Not that the paper was written by someone else, but that it never existed at all. Typically, the title is very very close or similar to the title of another paper they wrote, or a combination of a few titles they wrote with some added flair to make it seem like it's relevant to the topic you're asking for sources on. It will make the reference citations look very very real as well and it will hyperlink them, sometimes to a different paper than titles (since the original doesn't exist) or the link is broken to begin with.

AI: That's a really specific and concerning pattern you've identified - the way AI creates these almost-real papers by mixing and matching real authors with plausible-sounding titles. That must be frustrating when you're trying to do serious research.

For the mystery wire project you mentioned, when you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for different parts of that process, what factors influenced those decisions?

User: I wanted to add on my last response, apologies: The reason I still continue to use AI for literature reviews though, is that while it is alarmingly faking real scientists' names with non-existent papers, it usually does lead me to a scientist/scientists that are in the field and work-in or are adjacent to my topic. 

The factors that influence when I use AI for research are: How much time will this take? And, how utterly mundane is this task? For instance, my time was much better spent sitting in the lab with my hands actually on the oscilloscope, taking apart the controller, and running multitudes of other diagnostics, vs. if I spent hours combing through manuals or figuring out the exact right phrasing, search after search, to pinpoint the exact type of data I need to find.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially using AI as a time-saving filter for the tedious parts while keeping the hands-on diagnostic work for yourself. And I appreciate that follow-up about the literature reviews - it's fascinating that even with the hallucination problem, AI still points you toward relevant researchers in the field.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like that hands-on oscilloscope work you mentioned - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Well, I don't trust the AI to be thorough. While I may use it to help me with manual summaries, for instance, I still go back and skim the table of contents if there is one, and skim seemingly relevant areas to make sure it didn't miss anything - because it does, all the time. It gets a lot of things, and summarizes them pretty well, but it misses enough (sometimes 50/50) too frequently. So, when it comes to the idea of asking it to say, automate a series of *delicate* tests, I'd worry that period placed at the wrong spot while formatting a bulleted list I asked it to make ""earlier"" will become an issue.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the difference between tasks where you can double-check AI's work versus tasks where a small error could have significant consequences. It sounds like with delicate lab equipment, there's no room for that ""50/50"" reliability rate.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. When you have used AI for those manual summaries or forum searches, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: Manual extraction and summaries are a little annoying. I usually run them through a few different models to help fish out points any of them might have missed. Then I very quickly do a loose ctrl+f and search for related keywords I can think of - I don't ask the AI to produce a list of this for me because it always includes way too many extra things for whatever reason, making it harder to sift through. I skim around, and as for the accuracy of the summaries themselves, I only check the ones that look like they might be relevant, because at that point I am going to go back to the manual and closely go through that section. This ultimately still cuts down on a lot of time being able to have the AI do part of the work. Forum searches are easy; the AI never seems to fail to produce a link that goes to the correct conversation it references.

AI: That's a smart verification system - using multiple models to catch what each other might miss, then doing your own targeted keyword searches. It's interesting that forum search links seem much more reliable than those scientific paper citations you mentioned earlier.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I think the forum searches are so accurate because search engines often include a ""snippet"" that's relevant to your search on the results page, because of how deeply they scour a lot of forums. It's easy access information with a specific link for a specific quote (often) right above it - is my guess why this is accurate. God, if I could trust AI to be able to search scientific papers for relevant and related and related topics, not just a workaround to look up scientists in their fields, it would be a game-changer. The amount of time it would save me...everything in our lab would be fixed in a year, and I'd get to spend more time on my core projects, or even doing science by fixing everything instead of scouring through hundreds of papers a month! I'd love to spend more time doing actual scientific investigations into my core projects

AI: That makes perfect sense - the forum accuracy likely comes from that structured snippet data, while academic databases are much more complex. Your frustration really comes through about spending so much time on literature searches instead of actual scientific investigation.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions - your perspectives on using AI as a time-saving filter while maintaining hands-on control over critical work were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Not off the top of my head, though I spend a lot of time using AI in my research work, for personal tasks/planning, and general day-to-day questions, and would love to provide more insight in the future if needed!

AI: That's wonderful to hear! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about how you navigate AI's reliability issues - using it strategically for time-consuming tasks while maintaining direct control over critical lab work - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific workflows. 

Your point about AI's potential to free up time for actual scientific investigation rather than endless literature searches particularly resonated with me. The way you've developed workarounds for AI's limitations, like using multiple models and doing targeted verification, shows a really thoughtful approach to AI integration.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me! I have no questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent project I've worked on involved preclinical in vitro testing for cancer drug development. The cancer of interest is characterized by a specific aberrant fusion protein that drives oncogenesis. We want to target that fusion protein with a PROTAC drug. Our collaborator used their drug discovery ML model to perform in silico screening of a library of millions of compounds for their ability to bind to the fusion protein (and therefore serve as the ligand for building the PROTAC). A select few hits were synthesized and sent to us for in vitro validation. My work was to perform this binding validation via reporter assays and SPR experiments. A few of these hits showed promising activity, and the top hit was redesigned by our medicinal chemist for hypothetical improved binding and medicinal safety. Several of these proposed structural edits are being synthesized for repeat validation studies. The future steps would broadly be to use this ligand to build a PROTAC, test it in vivo, and if the results warrant so then it could move to the clinical testing phase.

AI: That's a fascinating project - thank you for walking me through that comprehensive workflow from computational screening all the way through to potential clinical applications.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: When designing my experiments, I sometimes used ChatGPT to double-check my mathematical calculations for very simple questions (e.g., dilutions). However, it was often wrong so my usage is minimal due to lack of trust. My coworker also experienced it hallucinating scientific citations.

Sometimes if I'm slightly unsure about something (such as being paranoid that I made an error in my math or a minor tangential fact) I will still use AI to quickly double-check, and if it agrees I take this as reassurance. If it doesn't, I will investigate further but not take the AI answer as an authority. This is the extent to which I use it.

AI: That's really helpful - you've identified a clear pattern in how you approach AI as a verification tool rather than an authoritative source.

For those mathematical calculations and double-checking tasks, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of maybe using a calculator, asking a colleague, or looking something up yourself.

User: Well I always use a calculator to begin with, and I do my own research to reference multiple external protocols in the event I'm planning a novel procedure. I use AI to double-check my work on those days when I'm a bit tired/etc. and I want to make sure I'm not, say, off by a factor of 1000 accidentally (e.g., when my stock solutions are written in micromolar vs. nanomolar), or that I didn't forget to include a condition/control, etc.

My coworkers are all very busy and this isn't an appropriate situation to ask them to double-check my calculations. So I would say that as it stands, I don't substitute AI in for the calculator/research, but perhaps it somewhat substitutes for asking a colleague to lend a second pair of eyes. I mainly think of it as a supplemental tool in its own category.

There was a time when the AI was wrong and my work was actually correct, and this wasted time because I *did* go ask someone else to verify that.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using it as a supplemental ""second pair of eyes"" when colleagues aren't available, but with healthy skepticism about its reliability.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual experimental design for the SPR experiments, data analysis from your reporter assays, or interpreting your binding validation results - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Due to the aforementioned accuracy/factuality problems I've witnessed firsthand from AI, it's not reliable enough yet to use for more complex problems like tailored experimental design or mathematically advanced data analysis. For example, I do all my data analysis using GraphPad Prism and by the time I'm done, I'm confident in my work. The problem with using AI here is that firstly, it's not trustworthy for the advanced math or conceptual understanding of the experimental context, so if I used it, I would have to double-check everything it did at which point I may as well have done it myself to begin with. This doesn't save time. Even if it were trustworthy, it doesn't integrate with my lab software tools such as GraphPad. For me to use AI for data analysis, it would have to either have integration with my software or replace its functionality altogether (e.g., the AI could handle finely controlled graph generation, organizing and storing my raw data, etc.).

However, I would use AI (if it were reliable enough) to research which formulas to apply in certain scenarios (for example, doing a novel drug combination experiment in which I need advice about applying Bliss and Loewe synergy analysis), or get its input about generating experimental design with sources cited.

AI: That's a really insightful breakdown - you're highlighting both the reliability barrier and the practical integration challenges with your existing tools and workflows.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. When you have used AI for those mathematical double-checks, how do you verify or validate what it produces, especially given that you mentioned it was wrong at least once?

User: Since I use it to double-check my preexisting work for the math equivalent of typos, I already know conceptually how to solve the problem and when the AI shows its work, I can usually see where it went wrong. It's often obvious stuff like confusing moles for molarity.

I recall once having a conversation with ChatGPT that amounted to ChatGPT claiming that it could not solve a dilution problem without knowing the molecular weight of DNA. It did not need this info, and when I asked it if it couldn't just answer the question via basic cross multiplication, it agreed and then solved the problem. So the AI could itself acknowledge its own error, but only when specifically prompted.

If I couldn't validate something the AI is saying via my own external research/knowledge then I would not put faith into the AI's explanation. I've also experienced it be very wrong about non-science topics.

AI: That's a perfect example - the DNA dilution issue really illustrates how AI can get confused about what information is actually necessary for a problem.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Literature review, definitely! Combing through papers and keeping track of info from multiple sources can take a ton of time. If AI could be relied on to cite sources accurately, this would be a dream. For example, I'd love to be able to feed the AI a batch of scientific papers, ask it to scrape them all for data related to a specific compound, and then summarize that info for me in a tabled list with citations.

AI: That's such a compelling use case - being able to synthesize information across multiple papers and organize it systematically would clearly be a huge time-saver for your work.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a supplemental verification tool while maintaining healthy skepticism about its reliability were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Thank you, and no, I have no other comments. Since many situations involve clearly correct/incorrect answers, I am very optimistic that AI can be trained over time to become quite accurate and powerful as a scientific research tool.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the current trust barriers and the potential you see for literature synthesis really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you described using AI as a ""supplemental tool in its own category"" - not replacing your primary methods but serving as an additional verification step when colleagues aren't available - gives us valuable perspective on how scientists are thoughtfully integrating these tools.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No let's start

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My research projects mainly laboratory based as I'm studying Medicinal Chemistry. I collect as much data as I can from the experiments, and write a report about them. This reuiqres extensive research, calculations, data analysis and evaluations, and the final product looks something similar to a study you find on PubMed. A recent project was on the effects of temperature on the pseudo-rate constants of the acid-catalysed ester hydrolysis of methyl acetate.

AI: That sounds like a really thorough process - from the experimental work all the way through to producing a publication-ready study. I can see how that would involve multiple stages of work, from the actual lab experiments to all that data analysis and writing.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Previously, I had bad experience with AI in terms of accuracy, so much so that I had contact my professor regarding the problem. Thereafter, I solely use AI to reword sentences, as it saves a little bit time trying to make a long confusing sentence more concise. I also use it for advice on the general presentation of the report, as it's always good to have a different perspective.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you had a significant trust issue early on that really shaped how you approach AI now. You mentioned you had to contact your professor about an accuracy problem - that must have been a pretty impactful experience.

For the sentence rewording and presentation advice that you do use AI for now, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those specific tasks.

User: Honestly, my traditional approach worked perfectly fine, it just took time to tweak to the point where I thought it was acceptable to submit. Using AI speeds this up, as I can  just tell it my ideas, and how I want a sentence to come across, and it fires back some ideas, and I can go back forth to dial it just how I want it. The presentation part is more of me overthinking it; I just need someone who I know is not going to plagiarise my work, to give me advice on what would look more professional/scientific.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using it as more of an efficiency tool for tasks where you already know what good looks like, rather than relying on it for the core content or analysis.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the data analysis, calculations, or the literature research you mentioned - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Again, it was the past experience that I had, it caused me over 3 hours of researching a niche topic. It's not something I can be entirely reliant on, and also I find those parts quite fun. Nothing is more satisfying than calculating your own % yield.

AI: That three-hour research detour sounds really frustrating - I can absolutely see how that would make you cautious about trusting AI for the more critical parts of your work. And I love that you find those analytical parts enjoyable - there's definitely something satisfying about working through the calculations yourself.

When you do use AI for the sentence rewording and presentation advice, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: You said it yourself, I already know what sounds good, and I read it many times over. Of course, I make mistakes sometimes, but they've never been because of how a sentence reads. I also compare my work to other publications.

AI: That's a smart approach - leveraging your existing expertise to quality-check the output. You're essentially using AI as a drafting tool while keeping yourself as the final judge.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Here's my last question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I can't put into words how much I want it to be able to compile the data exactly I want. Excel data sheets can be very time consuming, expecially when I have lots of data to work with.

AI: That's such a practical need - I can imagine data compilation and organization being one of those tedious but essential parts of research that just eats up so much time. The specificity of how you need the data formatted probably makes it even more challenging.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how that early accuracy issue really shaped your cautious but strategic approach to AI were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how one negative experience can really define someone's relationship with AI, and how you've found this middle ground of using it for efficiency while maintaining control over the critical work, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: i have no questions, lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently completed my doctorate, for it I researched encapsulins. The initial idea was centred on an interest in the material mineralized inside the structures and a desire to investigate them with scanning tranmission electron microscopy. The process began with designing a protocol and isolating protein structures from bacteria, before taking them for analysis using a STEM instrument. The final output was a chemical characterization of the nanoparticles found inside these structures

AI: That sounds like fascinating research! So you went from initial curiosity about the mineralized materials, through protocol design and bacterial isolation, to STEM analysis and finally chemical characterization.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: The major stages where I experimented with AI tools was in investigating the literature, experimental design and in the analysis of the STEM data. 

I am, by training, a microbiologist and my knowledge of STEM/physics is not expansive. Therefore, I made use AI tools for explain key concepts in these fields in a less maths intensive way. 

I found AI tools to be useful for performing quick calculations related to STEM instrument calibrations (such as alpha and beta semi-angle calculations). So, I began experimenting in using the tools for these. 

I also found AI tools to be useful in generating scripts for STEM data analysis. We collected a wide range of data types: diffraction, 4D-STEM, BF, HAADF, SE, EDXS and EELS. I found AI tools to be especially helpful in providing information about noise reduction routines/general imaging and spectroscopic data cleaning routines. As well as in writing scripts for handling the different data types in python.

AI: That's really helpful to understand how you used AI across multiple stages. It sounds like you found AI particularly valuable for bridging knowledge gaps and handling technical calculations.

For the STEM data analysis specifically - when you were deciding whether to use AI for generating those Python scripts versus writing them yourself or finding existing code - tell me about how you made that decision.

User: I mostly made use of AI tools for writing scripts/functions that were fairly simple but quicker to use AI than write out myself. For example, scripts that used global threshold (Otsu) and then created a figure with 6 subplots. These types of scripts take a long time to type out but can be handled quickly by AI tools.

AI: That makes sense - using AI for those routine but time-consuming coding tasks. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual protein isolation from bacteria or the protocol design phase - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Generally, protein isolations and designing wet lab experiments are something that requires nuance and hands on experience. For example, I worked with one bacterial strain where you had to initiate various steps of the isolation when the cells/cell lysate reached specific colors. The differences in color have to be seen to be understood and is seldom written down anywhere so an AI tool would not understand the difference to look for. Multiple experiences like this have made me hesitant to use AI tools for this type of task.

AI: That's a really insightful example - the visual cues and tacit knowledge that comes from hands-on experience. The color changes you mentioned are exactly the kind of nuanced, experiential knowledge that would be hard for AI to capture.

When you've used AI for those STEM data analysis tasks - the noise reduction routines and Python scripting - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: For these specific tasks, the output can be visualised as it is imaging/spectroscopic data. For example, when using AI tools for creating binary images, it is clear if the correct regions have been identified simply by viewing the original image and the binary image. For noise reduction of EELS data, you can visualise improvements in the quality of the elemental maps following the application of the routine.

AI: That's really practical - having that immediate visual feedback to assess whether the AI-generated code is working correctly.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: The area that I would like the most help from AI in would be in reading current literature. Often reading current literature requires a nuanced understanding of the literature in a field, that takes years to acquire. Having a tool that can point out these more important subtle results would be very handy especially when looking in different fields. For example, as a microbiology when reading current EDXS methods papers, I often felt like I was missing some of the finer details as I dont have years in the field. A tool to help with this would be excellent.

AI: That's such an interesting point - the idea of AI helping to surface those subtle but significant findings that only become apparent with deep field expertise. It sounds like you experienced this firsthand when crossing into the EDXS methods literature from your microbiology background.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a bridge between disciplines and for routine technical tasks were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: there is nothing else to touch on

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can help bridge knowledge gaps between disciplines - like moving from microbiology into STEM physics - and your point about the irreplaceable value of hands-on, experiential knowledge in wet lab work really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific research.

It's clear you've developed a thoughtful approach to integrating AI where it adds value while recognizing its limitations. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good and I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Recently I worked on a project that concerned the use of variational autoencoder models on galactic spectra. It has been suggested that models of this type can be used to facilitate novel scientific discovery by focusing on what details a model chooses to learn. The variational autoencoder was then designed and trained on some synthetic galaxy spectra and the results of what it learnt were analysed.

AI: That sounds fascinating - using the model's learned representations as a lens for discovery is a really interesting approach. 

Can you walk me through what the actual process looked like for you? I'm curious about the day-to-day steps - from when you first had this idea about variational autoencoders and galactic spectra, all the way through to analyzing what the model had learned.

User: The first step of the process was learning about variational autoencoders, as I had not used them before. The idea was suggested by a professor in my department who had carried out some earlier work applying the models to other data. Once I had necessary background knowledge I then built a simple variational autoencoder model on the galactic spectra. Once this was working, the focus could then be on refining the model to improve its performance. This included adding more and more complex layers to the model and refining the hyperparameters for training. The final trained model was good at recreating the spectra, as an autoencoder is required to do, and largely successful at disentangling the learned features. The results were analysis by testing how independent the dimensions of the learned representations were, how much the dimensions correlated with physical parameters that were set during the generation of the synthetic data, and exploring how the spectra change by just adjusting one dimension at a time and looking for physical reasoning behind what is happening. The dimensions did not have particularly strong correlations with the physical parameters but the adjusting of one dimension at a time did appear to have some physical grounding. While we did not perform it for this project, further analysis of features the model learns that do not have physical reasoning could be the path towards using these types of models for novel scientific discovery

AI: That's a really comprehensive workflow - from learning the fundamentals all the way through to that intriguing analysis of the learned dimensions. I'm particularly interested in how you approached the learning phase and model building.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools to help with your work?

User: AI tools are often useful for giving a straightforward explanation of what certain parameters or processes mean when it's hard to find a straight answer on Google. AI tools can also be useful for the coding stage, especially when errors are occurring and you are unsure why. Overall, my use of AI tools in this project were quite limited but they were certainly useful when they needed to be

AI: That's helpful - so AI tools served more as a reference and troubleshooting resource for you. When you mentioned using them for explanations of parameters or processes, tell me more about how you decided to turn to AI versus other sources like papers, documentation, or colleagues.

User: Often using AI in these instances saved time. You could get an answer to your queries straight away, rather than having to comb through a reference manual or waiting for a colleague's response

AI: That makes sense - the immediacy is clearly valuable when you're in the middle of working through something. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the model design choices, the hyperparameter tuning, or analyzing those learned dimensions for physical meaning - what's kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: The model design and hyperparameter tuning were best performed by actually training the model and seeing what makes a difference. Training machine learning models like this is often very nuanced and the answers that AI might give you to try and improve them are often generic and not applicable to your project, especially one as specialised as this. For this reason, trial and error was the best way to go, rather than blindly trust the suggestions of an AI tool. In terms of analysing the learned dimensions, an AI tool might be helpful but we did not consider using one at the time. This part of the project is where the actual physics comes in, rather than just the technology. I think it's fair to say that the physical analysis is best done by the actual physicists that know the subject inside and out, rather than an AI tool that just predicts what the next word in a sentence should be.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - between the more generic technical aspects where AI can help versus the domain-specific, nuanced work that requires your deep physics knowledge and intuition.

When you have used AI for those straightforward explanations or coding issues, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the information is reliable?

User: Coding issues are easy to test as you can just implement the model's suggestions into your program and check if it does indeed work. More factual information such as explanations are often answered better by the AI tools as they just need to regurgitate information rather than follow a logical process.

AI: That's a practical approach - the immediate feedback from code testing definitely makes validation straightforward there.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Often in scientific research we have a great idea and make progress with said idea but reach a wall where we don't know how to proceed. If an AI model could help with this aspect of research, it would be fantastic. The problem is that often the best way forward is something that has never been done before so it's unrealistic to expect an AI tool to be consistently helpful for this.

AI: That's such a compelling point - you've identified what would be the holy grail of AI assistance, but also precisely why it's so challenging. The very nature of novel research means you're venturing into territory where there isn't existing knowledge for an AI to draw from.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the distinction between generic technical help versus domain-specific expertise, and especially that insight about hitting research walls where the path forward is truly novel, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: That is all, thanks

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI tools serve as efficient reference resources while the core scientific reasoning remains firmly in the domain of human expertise really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. That distinction you made between areas where AI can provide generic support versus where deep domain knowledge is irreplaceable was especially valuable.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The most difficult part when it comes to research projects, for me, is always coming up with an initial idea. I struggle to brainstorm ideas and especially in contested fields it can be difficult. My current project involves molecular rotors, but the most difficult part for me was finding the initial idea. The rest of the stages, whether it be experimental design, literature review or the much later stages of conclusion drawing and report drafting, are usually a lot easier for me and I can get into a ""flow"" where I just progress on section after section.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you have a clear sense of where you naturally hit your stride versus where you get stuck. Tell me more about that initial ideation challenge, especially in contested fields. What does that struggle actually look like for you day-to-day?

User: For me, as someone who doesn't think of themselves as very creative, it can be very easy to see someone else's idea and think ""oh that's great what if i did that too"". However this is really detrimental when trying to come up with a unique perspective. Usually day to day this leads to me having to sift through hundreds of papers and note down interesting ideas, common views and the different ideas being tested. I never have a distinct idea of, I want to do that. It's quite gradual and more methodical in narrowing down potential areas.

AI: That methodical approach of sifting through hundreds of papers and gradually narrowing down areas sounds quite intensive. Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Recently with the influx of better and better AI tools, I have been using them for things like sifting through papers and albeit more limited, recently I have been using them to look through literature for my current project. This is because the ability of AI to summarise ideas is a really large time save and even though I do not have full confidence in results, it is fine in initial stages where I only need to roughly brainstorm. The main usage for me  is always asking AI to ""summarise this paper and its findings"", or prompts along this train of thought.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a way to speed up that initial sifting process when you need broad understanding rather than precision. For that specific task of summarizing papers and findings, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of reading through everything yourself.

User: It was mainly about time and efficiency. I like to be efficient with most things that I do and therefore with the influx of AI all around us and everyone saying this can help etc.. it was the logical next step to at least try it. While I am very ""self"" oriented when it comes to doing (I don't trust others with my own work and like to do stuff in my own way), I figured that using AI for something that does not take ""skill"" but more just time is a good starting place. I still do not have full confidence in models however and there is still time needed to check results and make sure they are on track.

AI: I can hear that balance you're striking - being efficiency-focused while also being very protective of your own work quality. You mentioned you ""still do not have full confidence in models"" and need time to check results. When you've used AI to summarize papers, how do you actually verify or validate what it produces?

User: The easiest way for me to do that is to grab the summarised paper that the AI made for me and noting down the key takeaways. These are usually important data points, conclusions on theory or just points relevant to what I asked for. After this, I just do a simple Ctrl + F to locate where in the paper this is mentioned and do a quick skim to check for correctness. This saves time since before the summary I do not know what the result will be and so I cannot easily find it with Ctrl + F.

AI: That's a clever verification workflow - using the AI summary as essentially a roadmap to find the key points more efficiently in the original paper. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like experimental design, conclusion drawing, or report drafting that you mentioned earlier - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I just do not have the confidence to let AI reproduce more creative, and also much more important areas of work. The biggest issue for me is that there just is not enough quality, especially in a highly specific STEM field. I cannot trust AI judgement on more important stages and especially not on things like design. There is a potential for using AI on grammar/proof reading and this is probably the most feasible next step, but for me I would not use current AI on the important stages. The only exception is data analysis. Usually this step can be tedious and sometimes more on the boring side (parsing through lists of readings, plotting etc..) and I have employed AI to help with coding/data analysis.

AI: That distinction you're making is really insightful - between tasks that are time-consuming but lower-stakes versus the creative, high-stakes work where you need full control. You mentioned data analysis as an exception where you have used AI for coding and parsing through data. Tell me more about that - what made data analysis feel different from those other important stages?

User: I have been using AI for things like coding for a little while and I trust this segment of AI a lot more. Its also because with things like coding/data analysis, if the AI gives wrong code it is very obvious. I can clearly see ""oh well this is not what I should see"". I think that models are much better at data analysis than actual conclusion drawing, especially in the chemistry field. I do still employ a bit of effort to check a lot of data analysis and usually the use of AI will just be to give me a starting point that I can build on. A framework of code for example to save me time.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the immediate feedback loop with coding where you can quickly see if something works or not gives you much more confidence. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't help with well, what would that be and why?

User: I would love AI to be very capable in the image generation field. This is because I do not really enjoy the creation of graphics and images. Examples include making reaction schemes and mechanisms, but most importantly is having to create energy level diagrams / MO diagrams. This would be insanely helpful but AI is no where near being able to create important and custom diagrams like this.

AI: That's fascinating - you'd want AI to handle the visual communication of complex scientific concepts that are so specific to your field. It sounds like you have a clear vision of where AI could really move the needle for you, but the technology just isn't there yet for those highly specialized diagrams.

Those are all my questions. Your perspectives on how you balance efficiency gains with maintaining control over the high-stakes creative work were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No I think thats everything thanks!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a verification roadmap for literature review and that clear distinction between high-stakes creative work versus time-consuming but lower-risk tasks really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's been really valuable to hear how you think about trust and verification in different contexts - from the immediate feedback of coding to the specialized knowledge needed for chemistry conclusions.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: that sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am a physics researcher specifically quantum physics. My most recent work was in a theoretical description of a 2-level quantum emitter (a qubit). A new excitation protocol was tested against traditional methods in various situations (noise energy losses etc) and their differences were compared

AI: That sounds like fascinating work! I'm getting a picture of the theoretical side - developing and testing this new excitation protocol.

Can you walk me through what the actual day-to-day process looked like? How did you go from that initial idea about the new protocol to having results you could compare?

User: I began by reading the relevant literature, introductory quantum optics textbooks and some research papers, then I would try to recreate the plots from the research papers by coding in python, thats the main day-to-day. After getting comfortable with the new coding libraries like Qutip, I was ready to make new investigations, such as varying the transition frequency with time to explore new effects.

AI: That gives me a really clear picture of your workflow - from literature review, to recreating existing results in code, to then exploring new variations. The coding in Python with libraries like Qutip sounds like a central part of your process.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I experimented with AI in the literature review, just basic things like having ai explain some basic topics and give examples, and help me find relevant papers. Also I would have AI explain things to me about QuTip, such as time dependent Hamiltonians, if it was fully explained in the QuTip manual. I also found AI helpful in writing with LaTeX as some of the commands can be confusing there.

AI: Interesting - so AI helped with understanding concepts, finding resources, and technical writing support. Let me focus on one of those areas. For the literature review part where you used AI to explain basic topics and help find relevant papers - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those tasks.

User: I would never solely use AI for these tasks. For the literature review I would use AI suggestions as a springboard to do my own research and I would verify that the papers it suggested were real, relevant and reputable. A more traditional approach would be to use websites like ArXiv etc or some newer websites like connectedpapers.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a starting point but then doing your own verification. It sounds like you've found a balance between leveraging AI's suggestions while maintaining your own critical evaluation.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual coding of new investigations or the theoretical modeling - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Sometimes I would test the AI's ability to code but it performed very poorly, also I feel like that is my responsibility and I would not want to rely on an AI model to do my job. Also I have used AI's before with newer libraries like QuTip and Qiskit and the Ai's knowledge is usually out of date and not very useful.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - both the performance issues and the philosophical point about it being your responsibility as a researcher. The outdated knowledge with newer libraries like QuTip and Qiskit sounds particularly frustrating when you're working with cutting-edge tools.

When you have used AI for those areas where it was helpful - like explaining basic concepts or LaTeX commands - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: For explaining basic concepts, I would already have some understanding so the AI just helped clear things up and explain connections to other areas of physics I was knowledgeable in. For LaTeX commands if the LaTeX document looked good and had everything I wanted then that was all the validation I needed.

AI: That's a smart approach - leveraging your existing knowledge as a filter for the concept explanations, and having clear visual feedback for the LaTeX outputs.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I think if it could teach me to code in new environments what I wanted perfectly and fully optimised that would be great. Also if it could tell me my ideas may work but would not interesting enough for a paper submission, and offer alternatives or improvements that would be good.

AI: Those are both really compelling use cases - having AI as a perfect coding tutor for new environments, and as a research advisor that could evaluate the novelty and interest level of ideas. The second one especially sounds like it could save a lot of time and help with strategic research decisions.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on using AI as a verification tool rather than a primary research method, and the challenges you've faced with outdated knowledge in specialized libraries, were particularly insightful.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think a truly strong AI tool that would be incredibly useful for researchers must be more honest. It must tell researchers that it doesnt knwo the answer, and that cant help with some tasks, in the same way that even a supervisor would not be able to help a reseracher in some cases.

AI: That's such an important point - the need for AI to be more honest about its limitations and knowledge gaps. That honesty would actually make it more trustworthy and useful as a research tool, rather than potentially misleading researchers or wasting their time.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about maintaining your responsibility as a researcher while strategically using AI as a starting point, and especially that final point about the importance of AI honesty, really help us understand the nuances of how AI can fit into real scientific work.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I really appreciate the time you've given me today.

User: ok am i done here

AI: Yes, you're all done! Thank you again for your time and thoughtful responses. This was really helpful for our research. Have a great rest of your day!"
science_0088,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. I'm ready to dive in.

AI: Great! I'm excited to hear about your work. 

Let's start at the beginning - could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: Sure thing, though I must apologize - this particular project is ongoing so I won't share too many details. Briefly, I was investigating the oxidative degradation of model pollutants by combination nanomaterials made in our lab. The process for our group is fairly straightforward: Brainstorm modifications to a base material, review literature to assess the planned study's novelty, perform experiments, analyze data, write, submit. And if anything surprising happens, that's kept for further study.

AI: That's a really clear overview of your process - thank you for walking me through that even with the ongoing nature of the project. The combination nanomaterials for pollutant degradation sounds fascinating.

So looking at that workflow you described - from brainstorming modifications through to submission - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I dabbled in using AI tools for literature review and manuscript writing.

AI: Tell me more about that dabbling - what did that look like in practice for both the literature review and manuscript writing parts?

User: For literature review, it looked like uploading relevant articles as context for questions I might have regarding the entire body of knowledge - What materials have been investigated? What synthetic techniques were used? Are any materials missing X characterization? Do any studies abstain from probing reaction mechanisms? What follow-up studies are proposed for X materials? etc. When writing manuscripts I typically ask the model to look for anything I may have missed, errors in style, small first-draft edit type things.

AI: That's really helpful detail - I can see how you're using AI as almost a research assistant and editor in those areas. 

For those specific tasks you mentioned - like asking AI to identify missing characterization or probing gaps in reaction mechanisms - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that kind of literature analysis.

User: It really came down to literature volume. With relatively small sets of papers it doesn't take too long to assess things like the materials investigated, synthetic methods, and characterization. With larger sets it can take a while, and that's where I would have the model take a first pass at some of these assessments.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - volume as the key deciding factor. So for the larger literature sets where AI takes that first pass, how do you then verify or validate what it produces? What does your process look like after the AI gives you its initial assessment?

User: If the model identifies specific papers or sets of papers I'll verify those first, otherwise I'll look for the most interesting claims and ask which papers they came from.

AI: That's a smart verification approach. Now I'm curious about the flip side - thinking about the other parts of your research workflow where you haven't used AI yet, like the brainstorming modifications, the actual experiments, or the data analysis. What's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: In my field material modifications can be made on any number of axes and be considered novel, I don't really need help brainstorming in that respect. Our experimental battery is fairly well defined and doesn't change much. For data analysis the hardest part is plotting everything with consistent conventions. However, for interpretation of the data my hesitation is that there's nuance that models might misapply.

AI: That nuance concern is really interesting - you mention that's specifically what holds you back from using AI for data interpretation. Can you tell me more about what kind of nuance you're worried a model might miss or misapply when interpreting your results?

User: To write a cohesive story requires constant recall of why each experiment was done, what different results mean, and what they collectively imply for further study. And that recall also needs to exist in the broader context of the literature review and the rationale for the research. My hesitation is that when I ask the model to interpret my results is that the model will write, in effect, a lengthy caption describing each graph instead of tying the results together into one fluid narrative.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the difference between describing individual results versus weaving them into that cohesive narrative that connects everything back to your original research rationale. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love for AI to perform benchtop chemistry on my behalf - labs routinely contain hazardous materials.

AI: That's such a practical and safety-focused wish! The hazardous materials aspect is something I hadn't considered but makes complete sense.

Those are all my main questions - your perspectives on using AI strategically for high-volume literature review while being cautious about nuanced interpretation were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Not at this moment. Thanks for your time.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about how literature volume drives your AI usage decisions, and especially your point about the difference between describing results versus creating cohesive narratives, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's been great learning about your thoughtful approach to integrating these tools where they add value while maintaining your expert judgment where it matters most. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again for your time today!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do have a few questions, yes.
1. Is this restricted to only scientists or all the STEM fields?
2. What level of expertise is needed for this interview?
3. Can university students also undertake this successfully?

AI: Great questions! Let me clarify those for you:

1. This isn't restricted to just scientists - we're definitely interested in hearing from anyone working in STEM fields, whether that's engineering, mathematics, computer science, or any other technical discipline. The research workflows and AI integration challenges are often quite similar across these areas.

2. There's no specific expertise level required. Whether you're early in your career, mid-career, or very experienced, your perspective is valuable. We're interested in understanding how people at different stages approach AI integration.

3. Absolutely - university students can participate successfully. In fact, students often have really interesting perspectives since you might be encountering both traditional research methods and AI tools simultaneously, which can offer unique insights into how these approaches compare.

The key is that you have some experience with research processes - whether that's through coursework, lab work, thesis projects, internships, or professional work. Even if you're just starting to explore how AI might fit into your work, that's exactly the kind of authentic experience we want to understand.

Does that help clarify things? Are you ready to dive in, or do you have any other questions?

User: One last question: does undertaking engineering design work and groupwork-based engineering projects also fall under this category?

AI: Absolutely! Engineering design work and group-based engineering projects definitely fall under this category. Design processes - whether you're working on mechanical systems, software architecture, circuit design, or any other engineering domain - involve many of the same core research workflow elements we're interested in: problem identification, ideation, prototyping, testing, analysis, and iteration.

Group projects are particularly interesting because they add another layer of complexity around how AI tools get integrated into collaborative workflows and decision-making processes.

So whether you've been using AI for design optimization, code generation, literature reviews for your projects, data analysis, documentation, or any other aspect of your engineering work, that's exactly what we want to hear about.

Ready to get started?

User: Yes, let's get started

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent engineering project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The most recent and complete project that I worked on was based in the field of Humanitaritan Enginnering, where we were made to:
1. form groups within the class
2. choose an area of focus - the choice was between 2 local council areas where there were several socio-economic, -environmental, etc.
3. choose a field - the choices were between energy, floods, community, etc.
4. choose a specific focus, each varying based on the field chosen

Our group chose Solar Energy, where our initial ideas were more aligned with social aspects of a solution regarding solar that could work within existing infrastructure. I was the one who proposed the more technical and ""innovative"" ideas (such as sun tracking solar panels, an energy network between houses to help share energy resources)

We were made to apply / follow the entirety of the Engineering Design Process regarding our project throughout the course. Our final assignment was a proper Design Proposal with all the aspects that we did (such as a literature review, ideation, screening, testing, next steps, etc.). Because our chosen solution was more on the techincal side, I was in charge of most of the literature review, getting down a comprehensive Ideation and Screening sections for our ideas.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive project that took you through the full engineering design cycle. I'm particularly interested in how you tackled that literature review and ideation work since those can be quite intensive parts of the process.

Where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: I tried using Generative AI (GenAI) tools to get a general idea of what kinds of ideas we needed to come up with. However, I noticed that most - if not, all - of the ideas were very general and ones that the community themselves could come up with and implement, rather than ones based more in Humanitarian Engineering. 
So I devised a plan to have a more technical solution (the sun tracking panels) that interacts with the community (such as through internships, workshops, etc.) to fulfill the human-centred aspect of the solution, and coordinated with the team accordingly.

As for the Literature Review, I moreso used GenAI tools to figure out the relevant statistics, facts and figures that were needed, and then focused on searching the literature for them instead of the aspects of the solution itself. Most of the Literature Review was about telling a story to the reader, so I left the expanding of the content in the Proposal to another group member and focused on actually gathering the sources.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you discovered some important limitations with the GenAI suggestions early on and then found more targeted ways to use it effectively.

For the literature review work specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding those statistics and figures.

User: My though process was such, GenAI tools lacked the comprehensiveness and scenario-specific detail required for the Proposal (without having the feed the entire assignment requirements to them) while making the workload manageable, whereas a traditional method gave a high workload (which would be heightened even more when considering my other classes at the time) but was more comprehensive in terms of pure content.

So I thought that, if I used GenAI to get an overview and a basic understanding of what the group's chosen solution entailed (calculations, statistics, related scientific concepts, etc.), it would make finding relevant sources easier.

AI: That's a really strategic approach - using AI as almost a preliminary research compass to orient yourself before diving into the traditional sources. It sounds like you found a middle ground that balanced efficiency with the depth you needed.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you didn't use AI - like the actual solution design or the story-building aspect of the literature review - what kept you from trying it there?

User: The limiting factor was that we needed concrete evidence of having done the design and understanding the community's plight for our chosen problem. While GenAI tools might be able to write up a scenario for [x] community that experiences [y] problem because of factors [a], [b], and [c], which can be assisted by a solution in field [z], they would not be able to make it as scenario-relevant as what we - the group actually working on the project - would be able to. Furthermore, having GenAI tools make a design is vastly different to making it ourselves on a platform such as SolidWorks or another CAD software.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's that authenticity and contextual understanding that you need to develop yourself, especially when you're working on a real community problem. And the hands-on design work clearly requires that direct engagement with the tools and process.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask about the flip side: when you did use AI for those overview tasks and finding statistics, how did you verify or validate what it produced?

User: I had the GenAI tools use and cite the sources that they used, and followed the links that they provided to validate their claims and interpretations. I also searched for other reports and journals on the same topic to see if their conclusions and results supported or invalidated the GenAI's claims. 
When I could not find other relevant websites or sources (such as prices for installing and maintaining a conventional sun tracking solar panel system, of which there were multiple figures with none being of the required proportions or having the right mountability options), I used both conservative and generous guessing that were backed by what I could glean from such sites (such as service provider and installer sites).

AI: That's a thorough verification approach - cross-referencing sources and using your engineering judgment when data gaps appeared. It sounds like you developed a pretty systematic way to work with AI while maintaining the rigor your project required.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research or design work that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: The idea generation process would be my first choice of where to perfectly implemet AI tools. The main reason that I chose this area is because of the sheer extent of mental blocks and lack of creativity that can plague engineers in this area; even our group was stuck here for almost a week because of the academic restrictions on GenAI tools. Also, as discussed previously, GenAI tools suggest very generic options that are targetted towards the general population rather than towards engineers, which doesn't help with the mental blocks.
Even having a GenAI tool that assists in coming up with partially valid ideas that can spark inspiration and innovation would be a great help in this area of the Design Process.

AI: That's a really compelling point about the mental blocks in ideation - it sounds like there's a gap between the generic suggestions AI currently provides and the kind of engineering-specific creative spark that could actually help break through those stuck moments.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on finding that sweet spot between AI efficiency and authentic engineering rigor, and especially your insights about the ideation bottleneck, were particularly valuable. Is there anything else about AI in your engineering work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: A very general point would be an over-reliance on the tool's training data that could compromise the user's intended purpose and the integrity of their usage of the response when using GenAI tools, especially in academia. This is the likely cause of the generic ideas that I mentioned earlier. This is most prevalent in fields such as Software Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, etc. where coding and programming take up a significant portion to a vast majority of the content.
The training data dictates the response to be perfectly industry standard / professional level, when most students using GenAI tools for programming classes and assignments have a barebones understanding of the language. The discrepency is easy to spot, even between students. Even students who search the web for more optimal ways to achieve the results of an assignment wouldn't come upon the kinds of methods that GenAI tools suggest.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the training data mismatch - the gap between industry-standard, professional-level responses and where students actually are in their learning journey. It sounds like this creates almost a ""too advanced to be believable"" problem that can undermine both learning and academic integrity.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for preliminary research while maintaining hands-on authenticity for the core design work, and especially your point about the training data creating responses that don't match student skill levels, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering education and practice.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions to start with.  I'm ready to go.  Let's get started!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Over a year ago, we started analyzing explosive residue samples that would be found in soil.  EPA has a method for it called EPA Method 8330.  It typically employs the use of a UV or PDA detector and you have to test your samples with two different columns.  We were trying to innovate by using PDA as the first dimension and MS as the confirmatory dimension.  

We started first by getting standards and viewing them in scan mode both with positive and negative polarities.  We started on a TQ instrument for easier characterization and then moved over to a single quad in tandem with a PDA.  We were able to find most residues with a DUIS source on the 2050, but on the 8060 we could see everything, with great sensitivity when ionizing with APCI.

AI: That sounds like a really complex analytical chemistry project with multiple instrument configurations. Tell me more about that process - what were the key stages you went through from that initial idea of using PDA and MS together to actually getting those results on the different instruments?

User: First, we needed input from the field.  What are they currently doing, and how do they want to improve? After receiving that feedback we had a set of analytes to test.  Finding proper transitions with these very finnicky chemicals was very difficult.  These are usually analyzed via LC-UV or GCMS, but our collaborator wanted LCMS.  

With these clearly defined goals we determined what the dynamic range of the compounds would be.  We found after system optimization that we could meet the sensitivity requirements of the EPA method and then continued to figure out how to generate a method where all analytes could be detected in a single run as temperature really affected ionization efficiency.

We found a happy medium and have shown this data at conferences and our collaborator is excited to see the progress we have made.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you had to balance a lot of technical constraints while meeting those EPA sensitivity requirements. The temperature effects on ionization efficiency sound particularly challenging to work around.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Searching for likely adducts or in-source fragmentation products has been very helpful.  The analytes don't always generate a predictable precursor ion, and having a resource to brainstorm with was very helpful.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a brainstorming partner for those unpredictable precursor ions makes a lot of sense. Tell me more about that process. When you hit one of those challenging analytes that wasn't giving you the expected precursor ion, how did you approach using AI to help figure out what might be happening?

User: We would give a prompt like, 'We are trying to detect 2-nitrobenzene. It has a MW of 123.11 g/mol. We would predict to see an [M+H] precursor of 124 and an [M-H] of 122.  We aren't seeing these.  Nor are we an M+ or M- ion.  Are there any records that might suggest in-source fragmentation?  What other transformations might happen that we should consider?""

AI: That's a really specific and methodical way to use AI - essentially having it help you think through the possible chemical transformations when your expected ions don't show up. 

For that specific task of troubleshooting unexpected ionization behavior, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of maybe consulting literature or discussing with colleagues.

User: We did all of it.  We worked as a team to try to figure this out and we had various ideas.  We also consulted literature.  The LLMs we used leveraged search capabilities so we felt that it could be like another researcher that might have a valid point of view compiled from established literature, online notes and blogs.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - treating the AI as another team member with its own perspective rather than replacing your traditional methods. It sounds like you saw it as complementary to your literature searches and team discussions.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your research process - from that initial field input gathering, through method development, optimization, and presenting at conferences - what's kept you from trying AI in those other areas?

User: Sometimes we have been able to accomplish this on our own.  Other times we already have tools that we want to share in our publications that are proprietary to our organization.  Security of LLMs isn't known or entirely trusted yet.  

On other projects we have asked for help with method development or for inspiration to get over the writer's block or paralysis that happens when beginning the creation of a technical note or a conference presentation.

For one member of the group it has been more an issue of ""learning something new.""  It is still early on and we are trying to find where it fits best.  We've also had it code some interactive games to create engaging educational content.

AI: That's a really honest picture - it sounds like there are both practical concerns around security with proprietary information and also just the natural learning curve of figuring out where AI fits best in your workflow.

When you have used AI for things like getting over writer's block or method development inspiration, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: Our experience helps a lot.  We all of graduate degrees. We also review things as a group.  If there are assumptions made that are untrue or we are unsure about we either present the LLM with the proper data to aid in training or we just rely on what we know to be the facts.

AI: That makes perfect sense - using your collective expertise and peer review process to catch any issues. It sounds like you treat AI outputs with the same scrutiny you'd apply to any other information source that needs validation.

We're approaching the end of our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Generating expert level collateral with minimal user input.  I would love to have a template that asks for inputs and data and outputs beautiful report or presentation with figures, data processing and representation without the hours involved to write and the difficulty some have in writing in a language that is foreign to them.

AI: That's a compelling vision - essentially having AI handle the entire translation from raw data and inputs into polished, professional scientific communication. That would address both the time burden and language barriers that can be real obstacles in sharing scientific work.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a collaborative brainstorming tool while maintaining rigorous validation practices were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: If you could ask me any other question, what would you ask?

AI: That's a great question! If I could ask you one more thing, it would be:

When you're working with your team and someone suggests using AI for a particular task, what's the conversation like? How do you all decide together whether it's worth trying, and have you noticed any differences in how team members approach or feel about using AI in your research?

I'm curious about the team dynamics around AI adoption, especially since you mentioned one team member finding it more challenging to learn something new.

User: It is usually met with interest.  We all understand the team member who is hesitant.  They don't truly mind the information that comes from AI, but they also don't confident in ""piloting"" it for themselves.  I was the first to use it and when I showed what I was able to create with AI for a first draft of a PowerPoint presentation, they were astounded.  We reviewed what was created and noticed some amazing capabilities and some shortcomings.  Essentially, it proved that this can help us streamline our workload and that is how we use it.  We all have the expectation that we don't take anything as ""the truth"" from AI, because that isn't what we do as scientists.  Everything must be tested for legitimacy so that the best research can be done and shared.

AI: That's a wonderful way to put it - ""we don't take anything as 'the truth' from AI, because that isn't what we do as scientists."" It sounds like your scientific training naturally equipped your team with exactly the right mindset for working with AI tools.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about treating AI as another team member while maintaining rigorous validation, and especially how you're thinking about AI's potential for streamlining scientific communication, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective has been incredibly valuable!

User: Thank you! I have enjoyed this conversation as well.  I hope we can continue in the future.

AI: Thank you so much! I really enjoyed our conversation too - your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into analytical chemistry research was fascinating to hear about. I hope we get the chance to continue this dialogue in the future as well. Take care!

science_0091,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, and no

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start us off, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Well the most recent research project started life many years ago, with an application to the European Commission in 2012. The application process took 9 months, and it involved 12 academic partners. We established and ran 3 short, focussed clinical trials over 6 years. The output was collected over 18 months. The final goal was achieved, which was the approval for marketing authorization of a drug for a rare disease. The publication of papers and analysis of data occurred for several years after the completion of the project due to the amount of data collected

AI: That's fascinating - a project spanning over a decade from initial application to final outputs. That's quite a journey from EU application to drug approval.

When you mention the analysis of data that occurred over several years after project completion, tell me more about what that analysis process looked like for you day-to-day.

User: There were lots of different data sets with various patient groups. It was difficult understanding what statistical tests would really be most scientifically valid for the different data sets

AI: That sounds like a really complex challenge - trying to determine the right statistical approach for multiple datasets across different patient groups. 

Where in that analysis process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools to help with those decisions or the analysis itself?

User: When the decisions for these data were made, no we did not - at that stage, we didn't even think of that. Now, I use AI LLMs as a sense check. I will define a statistical approach, then i will check if AI thinks this is robust. I then check that answer with a different LLM

AI: That's really interesting - so you've developed this cross-checking approach with multiple LLMs. 

For that statistical validation process you described, tell me about how you decided to start using AI as that sense check rather than sticking with your traditional approach of consulting colleagues or statistical references.

User: Because the statistics colleagues are too few, and too busy. And they always say that we collected the wrong data. ALWAYS. Even if we asked them before the data were collected

AI: That's a very relatable frustration! It sounds like AI has become a more accessible alternative when human statistical expertise is either unavailable or... less than constructive.

When you use AI as that statistical sense check and then verify with a second LLM, how do you decide whether their recommendations are actually sound? What's your process for validating what they tell you?

User: Mainly, if they agreed with me, it must be correct, right? And if two agree with me, well it's much more robust

AI: Ha! I appreciate that honesty - there's something reassuring about getting that confirmation when you've already thought through an approach.

Thinking about the other parts of your research workflow - maybe the clinical trial design, data collection planning, or manuscript writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I can't let go of too much control .....  I know AI make mistakes, if I have to check it anyway, maybe the planning and manuscript writing is just a bit too dangerous. OK, if it's designing a statistical approach I can accept that. It's actually quite useful because it drags out the statistical theory that you can check. In my experience, scientists know far too little about statistics. And they write about their data using unsound models, introducing noise into the literature with false positive and negative results.  I think it's actually really important to keep track of the things that you delivered from your reasoning and scientific know-how/experience. If you fool yourself that something an AI bot introduced and you've thought it came from your own intuition, I think this can become a feedback loop.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you've clearly thought deeply about where the boundaries should be. The point about maintaining awareness of what comes from your own reasoning versus AI input is particularly insightful.

You mentioned that scientists often know too little about statistics and introduce noise into the literature. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - while still maintaining that control you need - what would that be and why?

User: 3 things. 1 - Coming up with a novel twist on your ideas - what else could you test with your experimental set-up, what alternative hypothesis or additional ideas could be tested in the ame set of experiments. 2 - Statistical analysis, like I said. 3 - An alternative interpretation of the data as a sense check - what did I miss, why is that result that I thought would be positive actually negative - is that result really qualify as a positive result - that sort of thing. OK you could say that writing a manuscript, but then everyone's literature would start to look the same. Some sort of Admin assistant could also be helpful, but then I think you start to lose control of knowing the limits of your work boundaries. I don't want to accept all the applications from researchers around the world who wanted to do an internship, or let students and other staff book meetings with my AI assistant without my consent. In that case, I really need to do that myself.

AI: Those are really concrete and well-thought-out use cases - especially that idea of AI helping generate novel experimental angles from existing setups. That could be incredibly valuable for maximizing research efficiency.

We're about three-quarters through our conversation now. Your point about alternative data interpretation as a sense check is particularly interesting - that ""what did I miss"" perspective that could challenge your assumptions.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspectives on maintaining that balance between AI assistance and scientific control, and especially your insights about the statistical literacy problem in science, were particularly valuable. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I haven't approached the development of tools to measure the data itself. This could be potentially powerful. So some of the work involve immunohistochemistry, endless reams of qPCR data. The former is really tricky to quantify. You have a whole section on a slide and you look at one bit (or multiple fields, but not every single part)- is it transformed/activated/negative/similar or representative of the whole. Well you make a judgement and that's where you can get a judgement that disagrees with your colleagues, other professionals, because you all use a slightly different baseline of what you think is normal. So AI could transform that aspect of research too. But I suppose that's where I start to feel uncomfortable. I suddenly lost control ....

AI: That's a really profound point - immunohistochemistry interpretation is such a subjective area where even experts disagree on what constitutes ""normal"" or ""positive."" The potential for AI to standardize that interpretation is huge, but I can absolutely understand that discomfort about losing control over such a fundamental part of the analysis.

It sounds like there's this tension between the incredible potential benefits of AI standardization and your need to maintain scientific judgment and oversight.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that balance between AI assistance and maintaining control - especially around statistical sense-checking versus more interpretive work like histochemistry - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: ok thanks

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for taking the time to share such thoughtful insights about your research work. Your perspectives were really valuable for our understanding of how AI integrates into scientific workflows. Have a great day!

User: Good night!

AI: Good night! Thanks again for the great conversation."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, that sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: recently, i've been working on a project on reverse-robust computation using chemical reaction networks, or CRNs. i got the idea from my advisor, and got a certain result as part of my project for the graduate class he was teaching, and now i'm trying to generalize the result

AI: That sounds fascinating - chemical reaction networks and reverse-robust computation is quite specialized work. 

Can you tell me a bit more about what that generalization process looks like day-to-day? What are the specific steps you're working through to take that initial result and broaden it?

User: a lot of it is just trying to hunt down theorems in convex analysis (specifically polytopes) that might be useful to some things i want to show about lattice connectivity in polytopes. that and just staring at overleaf, ha

AI: Ha, the classic ""staring at overleaf"" - I think every researcher knows that feeling well! 

So you're hunting down theorems in convex analysis and working on lattice connectivity proofs. Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: sometimes i ask ai my central research question to see if it can more or less, do a literature review and hunt down relevant theorems/papers/books for me

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a kind of research assistant for finding relevant work. 

Tell me more about how you decided to try AI for that literature review and theorem hunting versus doing it through your traditional approach. What made you think to give it a shot?

User: the main issue is that i don't actually know that much about convex analysis, since i haven't taken a class on it. there is one that's offered but it's only once a year every two years, and it' for undergrads. so i don't really know what keywords to use while searching traditionally, like with google

AI: Ah, that makes a lot of sense - you're working in an area where you don't have the background vocabulary to effectively search on your own. That's a really practical use case.

When you've used AI to help with this theorem hunting and literature review, how do you verify or validate what it produces? How do you know if the theorems or papers it's pointing you toward are actually relevant and reliable?

User: well, i just go find the books and look for the theorems. sometimes ai does produce theorems that don't actually seem to exist, but a lot of the time it does a decent enough job, and finds stuff i had found independently

AI: That's really helpful - so you're using it more as a starting point and then doing your own verification by actually tracking down the sources. It sounds like there's a mix of hits and misses with the accuracy.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the actual proof work, the writing, analyzing your results - what's kept you from trying AI there, if anything?

User: i don't think ai is capable enough to do the proof work; i've tried lobbing some questions from the grad class on CRNs i took and it took a lot of handholding to get it to the right answer. for writing, i think i write well enough that an ai wouldn't really help me out. and for analyzing my results, i do use ai a bit, mostly to talk through my logic

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you've clearly tested AI's boundaries in different areas and found where it works and where it doesn't for your specific needs.

You mentioned using AI a bit to talk through your logic when analyzing results. Can you tell me more about what that looks like? How does that conversation with AI help you in that process?

User: mostly i just treat it like one of my peers, i go over some of the definitions that i'm working with to make sure it has a good idea of the background, then just show it my argument and ask it to look for any flaws

AI: That's a really smart approach - essentially using it as a sounding board or rubber duck to catch potential issues in your reasoning.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: hm, i guess making nice looking diagrams in overleaf? it does an okay job but needs a lot of tweaking to get what i want. i'd especially like it if i could just give it the CRN i'm working with and it would just generate the tikz that would represent it

AI: That's such a specific and practical wish - going from your CRN directly to clean TikZ code without all the back-and-forth tweaking. That would definitely save you time on the presentation side.

Those are all my main questions. Your approach of using AI selectively - as a literature starting point when you lack domain vocabulary, and as a logic-checking peer - while being realistic about its limitations for actual proof work really shows a thoughtful integration.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: hm, don't think so. thanks for the conversation

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a research starting point when you lack the domain vocabulary, and treating it like a peer for logic-checking, really help us understand the nuanced ways AI can fit into real scientific work. The practical challenges you mentioned - like AI sometimes generating non-existent theorems, or needing extensive handholding for proof work - are exactly the kind of real-world feedback that's valuable for us to hear.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your workflow and be so candid about what works and what doesn't. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your work on reverse-robust computation!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I worked on a qualitative survey analyzing the usage of HPV vaccines in chain-based pharmacies. The goal I had was to identify barriers  and facilitators that are present that would affect the impact that increasing HPV vaccination distribution in pharmacies would entail. I designed a survey and distributed it to a select group of parents and/or pharmacists to get their feedback on how to better assess these further

AI: That sounds like really important public health research. I can picture the survey design and distribution, but tell me more about that whole process - how did you go from having that initial goal of identifying barriers and facilitators to actually getting those responses from parents and pharmacists?

User: I made a brainmap of things that I believe aid or discourage a person to get vaccinated, then crossed that with things that a pharmacy could. I then looked into any prior research, as well as the legality behind pharmacists and pharmacy techs administering vaccines. I then wrote an abstract, designed the survey tool, and voila

AI: That's a really systematic approach - starting with your own brainstorming, then layering in the research and regulatory constraints. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI extensively during the background research, as it helped me find sources and prior knowledge. I wasn't at the point of using it to help me write just yet.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for that background research - what did that look like in practice?

User: I basically just asked the AI to do a deep search into the topic, kind of like doing a google search. I'd ask it to focus on whatever specific state or vaccine I was initially looking at, before I settled on HPV focus.

AI: That's helpful context. For that background research phase where you used AI extensively, tell me about how you decided to use AI versus doing traditional literature searches or other research methods you might normally use.

User: Truthfully, AI was easier than doing a full library search on my own. It also helped me find a starting point, where I would then go and look for resources similar to the ones that the AI shared with me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as a launching pad rather than the final word. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like designing the actual survey questions, writing the abstract, or analyzing responses - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I'm not sure. I think it felt unethical? Like it wouldn't be my own work or something. Maybe thats just my student brain conditioned to think of using AI sources as something that's similar to cheating. I don't think the thought of using AI to help me refine the language ever really came to me

AI: That's a really honest reflection - it sounds like there's this tension between finding AI genuinely useful for research but having these ingrained feelings about academic integrity when it comes to the actual writing and analysis work.

When you did use AI for that background research and it was giving you sources and prior knowledge, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced?

User: I would always make sure that it produced valid links in the NCBI or NIH databases. I'd also read the articles myself, as I would be looking for data or quotes that I could refer to in my own work. This was especially important for my abstract writing.

AI: That verification approach sounds really thorough - checking those database links and reading the actual articles yourself.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Knowing now that I could use AI during other aspects of my research, I would definitely want to use AI in scientific writing such as abstracts, manuscripts, and conference submissions. I find it hard to use the best or most accurate terminology, and instead prefer to use my own writing voice that is often not as clear.

AI: That's such an insightful point about terminology and clarity in scientific writing - it sounds like you see a real gap between your natural writing voice and what's expected in scientific communication.

Those are all my main questions - your perspective on using AI as a research starting point while being thoughtful about verification was particularly interesting, as was your reflection on the academic integrity concerns around writing.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: uhm I dont think so

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a launching pad for research while maintaining rigorous verification practices, and your honest reflection about the tension between finding AI useful and those ingrained academic integrity concerns, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's also fascinating how you've identified scientific writing as an area where AI could genuinely help bridge the gap between your natural voice and the precise terminology that scientific communication requires.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions at the moment. You can proceed.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive right in.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your current work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent project I worked on was applying quantum models to financial markets. The project started as an investigation of the raw financial data to evaluate how we could best drive the model. Then we established different variants of the model and tested them using the data. Once we had something successful we tested it within other environments (financial markets) to ensure it was useful as a more general tool. Then we performed numerical analysis to demonstrate that it was competitive or more capable than alternative options. This process was ultimately then written up in a complete paper.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - quantum models applied to finance is such an interesting intersection. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm curious about any stage - whether it was in the initial data investigation, model development, testing, analysis, or even the writing phase.

User: I used AI tools for assistance in code writing during multiple stages, for general ideas and content when report writing, and also for suggesting key literature and recent relevant findings.

AI: That's really helpful to know you've used AI across several different stages. Let's dig into one of those areas a bit more. 

For the code writing assistance, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach. What went into that decision-making process?

User: I used AI tools primarily to speed up the coding process. My traditional approach would be to create an idea then work out how to implement it in code on my own. This process would often involve learning about new methods or libraries and could take some time. Using AI tools meant this learning process was significantly faster as it synthesised the relevant information and provided sample code for me to modify.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to accelerate that learning curve when working with new methods or libraries. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like maybe the core model development or the numerical analysis phases - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: The core model development was a very creative process. It involved handling new ideas and concepts in a very new field (quantum economics or econo-physics). This is something I simply wanted to do for myself as I believe idea generation is the area where I can most demonstrate my ability. While AI tools may have helped brainstorm I wanted to see what I could achieve on my own first. For numerical analysis we were primarily using industry standard methods so while AI may have assisted in coding there was no great need for assistance beyond this.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - keeping the creative, idea generation phase as your own domain where you can demonstrate your unique capabilities, while being more open to AI assistance in the more standardized implementation areas.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Let me ask about verification - when you've used AI for code writing or literature suggestions, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: For coding I would quickly test the code to catch errors which would happen occasionally. For this project there was not a huge amount of code so manual verification was viable. Also, I would request that the model verify or regenerate its own responses which would catch errors as well. Essentially the scale of our project was such that manual verification was possible, or AI tools were used more as a guide instead of direct outputs of solutions.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using the manageable scale of your project to enable manual verification, and treating AI more as a guide than a direct solution provider.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I am satisfied with how AI has assisted me for my projects (or at least I am not fully sure what AI would be unable to help me with). I would however wish for better accuracy to reduce the time spent verifying. I am aware that better accuracy and increased scale will come with time.

AI: That's really interesting - you seem quite satisfied with AI's current breadth of assistance, but you're pointing to accuracy as the key area for improvement. That makes sense given the verification overhead you described.

We're nearly at the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions - your perspectives on keeping the creative core of your work while leveraging AI for implementation and learning acceleration were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think I have covered the essential points from my own experience with AI.

AI: Perfect, thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about maintaining ownership over the creative, idea generation aspects of your work while strategically using AI to accelerate learning and implementation were really valuable. I found it particularly interesting how you've found that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving the parts of research where you want to demonstrate your unique abilities.

Your point about accuracy being the key barrier - rather than capability gaps - really helps us understand how scientists are thinking about AI integration. The fact that you're satisfied with AI's breadth of assistance but focused on reducing verification overhead gives us important perspective on where improvements would have the most impact.

Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good! I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: I can't reveal full details of such projects I have been working on yet, but I can explain that a recent project was creating a simulation of controlled navigation and optimised flight design and trajectory of a re-entry vehicle. I am also currently working on a research project on a very different project in which I am looking at modelling wildfire and understanding how topology can be incorporated into CFD simulations. Current wildfire simulations may discretise satellite imagery into a tree map and use a weather forecast, however the local wind direction varies much more on small scales than the local forecast level. This can be due to atmospheric boundary layer interactions, artificial 'wind' generated by the flames themselves, as well as topological changes such as the influence of hills and valleys. This is important to consider in wildfire simulation to refine predictions of how the fire will spread over time. It is also useful research in other fields such as understanding the spread of contaminants. I will be looking at how a topology, which could even be an extendable pattern such as for waves if we model the small perturbance of waves in the sea, impacts fluid flow, in particular for wildfire spread. Using this research, such simulations can be improved.

AI: Thank you for sharing those fascinating projects! The re-entry vehicle simulation and the wildfire modeling with topological considerations both sound like incredibly complex research areas.

Where in those processes, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm curious about any part of the workflow - whether it was in the initial literature review, setting up simulations, analyzing results, or anywhere else.

User: There are points during literature review or researching new topics or methods of interest and or relevance to the project where I have used AI to quickly synthesise information - with linked sources - in addition to simply compiling a range of sources or quick explanations on niche topics I would like to quickly gain knowledge for.

Another area is in generating 'simple' code. This means code which is not complex or describing physics, but is just functions or refactoring of code which is a menial and long task which an AI can save me time by doing.

Additionally, I use it sometimes for data presentation - if I want to adjust code for graphs to change how something is presented slightly, then AI can be great for regenerating this code. Earlier in the research, AI is also good for generating code on more obscure code libraries when running sims or wanting quick feedback - e.g. I have asked it before to format the timestep results of a simulation to show like a table in the terminal with colour indicators. It had no issue with this, but it would've taken me far too long to find out how to do this neatly, to a point where it might not even have been worth my time.

AI: That's really helpful insight into how you're integrating AI across different parts of your workflow. It sounds like you've found it particularly valuable for those more routine tasks that would otherwise eat up significant time.

For the literature synthesis you mentioned - where AI helps you quickly understand niche topics with linked sources - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that kind of research.

User: It seemed like a more sensible decision to ask the AI to quickly gather sources on the information and topic I was interested in, to summarise this information, provide sources to the papers used, and where the information was found. I can then quickly verify this information and thus the synthesis. This is much more efficient than searching through lots of papers in hopes of finding the desired information, or clunky keyword searches or 'find in page' searches, to slowly gather information. I do not use this method multiple times a day, but when I want to consider maybe a different approach or decide that a specific topic would be helpful to learn more about, then AI can be a useful tool to find all of this information quickly - like a modified searching and synthesising tool. I would like to point out that I do stress the importance of checking the information it provided and requiring it to provide its sources of information, as it is not at a point where you would trust it blindly at all.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as an efficient starting point while maintaining that verification step. I appreciate you highlighting that trust aspect.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like perhaps the core physics modeling, the CFD simulation setup, or other areas - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: AI is not fluent in maths and physics, not to that level. When making the re-entry simulation, sometimes when using AI to refactor code or quickly generate some functions, I did not realise it was working on a function or logic relating to the physics modelling. I would then often encounter a bug or strange behaviour, and trace it back to somewhere the AI had poorly modelled physics in some way in a function I hadn't realised it modified.

Regarding CFD simulation setup or intelligent domain setup or design tooling, this does seem like a really cool application of it. I just haven't tried it yet or made a setup for it to work with. In both cases it currently seems more reliable and quicker - perhaps as I'm not an expert at integrating AI with CFD software etc - to do this humanly. I feel it also keeps me more connected to the project and prevents you from losing track of the steps you are taking in the work and why each thing makes sense. It is no good for only an AI to 'understand' what is going on - the researcher must know first and foremost.

AI: That's a really insightful point about AI's limitations with physics and math - and that example of tracing bugs back to AI-modified physics functions is particularly telling. I also appreciate your perspective on staying connected to the project and maintaining that understanding as the researcher.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. When you have used AI for those areas where it works well - like the literature synthesis or the simple code generation - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: As mentioned for the literature synthesis, I ask it to provide sources and where it located the information it used within them also. Therefore following some synthesis, I can quickly confirm the gathered information hasn't been hallucinated or misconstrued by the AI by following the links to sources and confirming.

For simple code generation, this is usually quite evident. I can gloss over the code and see it has refactored or generated in the style desired and is sensible code. Unit tests and general tests of the code also then verify there hasn't been an issue.

AI: That verification process sounds really systematic - especially requiring sources with specific locations for the literature work. 

Here's my final question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: There are many very optimistic answers that could be given here such as revealing the secrets to how I can get the data I need every time, but I'll keep things realistic.

Proven and reliable AI integration for intelligent design and modelling would be nice. Particularly in fluid mechanics, there isn't always theory to predict performance and CFD is required to observe behaviour. The researcher can then observe the results and use their knowledge to make changes. To automate this process would be amazing and be more time-efficient. This would need some carefully designed guidelines for intelligent changes to the design and it would have its own limitations probably as there would remain a level where a very experienced researcher viewing an image of the results would lead to far more insight than the AI attempting to interpret simply some numerical data and attempting to string together an explanation.

AI is already something that is being considered in projects for parameter sweep and optimisation processes in simulation, so I suppose it is mostly just taking this to the next level and further saving the time of researchers to make the work more efficient and less cumbersome.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on maintaining that balance between AI efficiency and researcher understanding were particularly insightful. It sounds like you've found a really thoughtful approach to integrating AI where it adds value while keeping yourself firmly in control of the physics and core methodology.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, I think that covers all that we need to talk about. This was a great conversation, thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about the importance of verification processes and staying connected to the physics of your work really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific research. That point you made about how ""it is no good for only an AI to 'understand' what is going on - the researcher must know first and foremost"" particularly resonated.

I really appreciate the time you took to walk me through your workflow and think through these questions. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your wildfire modeling and re-entry vehicle projects!"

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One recent project that I have worked on was for a carbon capture and utilization study. We were interested in seeing the technical, economical, and life cycle analysis impact of capturing a a carbon based feedstock and feeding it to microbes that could produce products from it. It started with analyzing the gas composition that would be fed to the microbes. The composition would be used with a reactor model to determine the metabolic pathways of products that would be made for commercial purposes. Generally speaking, the flow rate and composition of the gas can also determine how large all the equipment would need to be, so we can gather economic data from that. Finally, we can make estimates on utility consumptions from the process as well as the carbon sequestered in our process, so we can report out why greenhouse gas savings, typically in the Scope 1 and Scope 2 range.

AI: That's a fascinating project - the integration of technical modeling, economic analysis, and life cycle assessment sounds quite complex. It sounds like there were several distinct phases there, from the initial gas composition analysis through to the final greenhouse gas impact calculations.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I mostly like to experiment with AI models to see if they can help bridge the gap in estimation between what is recorded in databases/literature vs. what could help with estimation. Greenhouse gas emission databases are pretty extensive, but sometimes the GHG potentials (in units of CO2eq) for some components are either not tabulated or potentially behind a paywall. It is helpful to have estimations of these for internal and sometimes external reporting to get a better picture of how intensive a process is at carbon savings.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI to fill in those data gaps when you can't find GHG potentials in the standard databases or when they're not accessible. 

Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for estimating these GHG potentials. What goes through your mind when you're facing one of those missing data points?

User: I am typically trying to work with the AI for it to help me settle in on a reasonable approach for estimating. In the past, as an example, I have received helpful methods of estimating based on the functional group(s) of the unknown molecule and comparing it with functional groups of molecules with known CO2eq scores. There's more that can go into it than just functional groups, like we will work together to spot check other items such as elemental balance, structure, or other items, but finding similar components based on those which I have learned from the AI has been a helpful approach.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI to help you develop estimation methodologies based on molecular similarities rather than just getting a direct number. It sounds like you're building a systematic way to make those estimates.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the reactor modeling, equipment sizing, or the metabolic pathway analysis - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: It's not so much that something has not been keeping me back from using AI tools in those areas, it's more so that those areas are more within my domain of expertise/familiarity. I will use AI tools give me quick recaps or summaries of terms or methods when I am either unfamiliar or rusty on the topic, but I have not had the need to use them for frameworks for deep AI analysis.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're more confident in your own expertise for those core areas. So it sounds like AI serves different roles for you: filling knowledge gaps in areas outside your main expertise, versus providing quick refreshers on familiar topics.

When you've used AI for estimating those GHG potentials based on functional groups, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: There's no firm validation process that goes into place. I do however rationalize whether the results are reasonable and confirm it with my team as well. So, when we report the CO2 eq scores, we will clearly label the assumptions we have made on the components that have missing data. I think we are able to get away with it largely because these components make up a small portion of the overall mass balance, so even if the estimations are horribly off, the overall CO2eq scores should still be within reason.

AI: That's a really practical approach - acknowledging the uncertainty transparently and putting it in context of the overall impact. It sounds like you've found a way to leverage AI's help while being appropriately cautious about the limitations.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: One thing that would potentially be helpful, and I admittedly am not sure if this is a limitation, but I think it would be helpful for AI tools to use literature based results for estimation as opposed to numerical estimations. There are some times when I am trying to estimate Henry's constants for chemicals with water (such as nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide) at non-ideal pressures. Often times I find the AI models first approach is to find numerical methods for calculating this, but it would be much simpler if it first decided to scan literature sources to see if there are tabulated literature records for these values.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - you'd prefer AI to prioritize empirical data from literature over computational approaches for these physical property estimations. It sounds like there's a disconnect between how AI tends to approach these problems versus what would actually be most useful for your work.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI to bridge data gaps while maintaining appropriate skepticism, and your insight about preferring literature-based over computational approaches, were particularly helpful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Not quite. I think that just about covers everything. Thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for knowledge gaps while relying on your own expertise in your core areas, and especially your point about wanting AI to prioritize empirical literature data over computational methods, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: lets begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was recently conducting research on optimizing a bromination reaction on a specialized organic molecule that contains multiple reactive sites. The use of protecting groups was not feasible under the circumstance. So it calls for a design-of-experiment(DOE) to be conducted to find the optimal condition that favours the formation of desired product over other isomers, or maximize the yield of desired product while minimizes formation of isomers. a set of DOE experiments (64 experiments) was conducted and a lot of data were generated as well. I compiled the data into excel and feed it to AI so it can conduct some statistical analysis for me, and provide my with cleaned data so I can make graphs that showcase the relationship between each factor(temperature, substrate loading, equivalences, reaction time, yield of desired product, yield of isomers)

AI: That's a really interesting project - bromination selectivity can be quite challenging with multiple reactive sites. 

Tell me more about that step where you compiled the data into Excel and fed it to AI for statistical analysis. What specifically did you ask the AI to do with your DOE data?

User: So the raw data generated from the wet lab were compiled in excel sheets, with corresponding ""properties"" or parameters, you could say. Then a series of analysis were conducted, including ANOVA (analysis of variance) to narrow down parameters with significant influences, becuase we started with about 10 parameters, and it would be impractical to test each of them under full analysis. The top 4 parameters were chosen based on ANOVA results. We then started with 2 levels for each factor, and conducted a factorial design. The results obtained was used to construct a response surface plot that best showcased the direction of optimization. These analyses were done using AI.

AI: That's a sophisticated analytical approach - going from 10 parameters down to 4 using ANOVA, then building response surfaces. 

For that series of analyses you mentioned - the ANOVA, factorial design, and response surface plotting - how did you decide whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for handling this statistical work?

User: We are always trying to integrate AI into our work flow becuase it can save an enormous amount of time, especially when dealing with sophisticated numerical analyses. The work ideation were conversed extensively with AI prior to execution. During the workflow, we have consistently updating the AI by feeding it with our ideation adn observation from the experiements so it has a better understanding can help us decide which analytical tool to use

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI was deeply integrated throughout your entire process, from ideation all the way through analysis. You mentioned feeding the AI your observations from experiments to help it understand better.

Tell me more about that ongoing conversation with AI during the workflow. What kind of observations or updates were you sharing, and how did that shape the analytical recommendations it gave you?

User: Taking the bromination reaction as an example, we first gave it a few synthetic routes that we sought out based on our knowledge and existing literatures. We then asked the AI to compare and contrast them to help us narrow down to a few synthetic route that we can try. We also discuss these potential routes within our brainstorming sessions with scientists to verify their validity. Then after testing the routes that we finalized, it still had the issue where bromination would happen at a few sites, which finally led us to conduct DOE and use AI to help us optimize the route.

AI: That's a really comprehensive integration - AI helping with route comparison, then working alongside your team discussions, and finally assisting with the optimization when selectivity became the challenge.

We're about one-third of the way through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - whether that's the actual wet lab experimentation, literature review, or other aspects - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: Literature search is one key area that we did not use AI at all, because based on our experience, AI is not yet fully capable of such work, due to paywall restrictions, evaluation of literature for unreported molecules and sometimes provide hallucinated results.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the paywall issue and hallucination risks would be particularly problematic for literature work where accuracy is critical.

When you've used AI for the statistical analysis and route comparison work that you mentioned, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the ANOVA results or synthetic route recommendations are reliable?

User: For route comparison, we can ask the AI to find us the cost of each individual reagent, and gave us an estimate on the total cost per unit of product, this work is extremely time consuming when it comes to human doing it, becuase one needs to search all chemical supplies and punching the numbers to get a reasonable estimation on cost. AI saves a lot of time since we can provide it with a list of suppliers and their website and the AI does the rest of searching and cost estimation. Also, We do evaluate the ANOVA results AI provided using existing statistical software designed for these work, but due to the time-consuming nature of such process, we turned our attention to AI hoping that it will save significant amount of time.

AI: That cost estimation work sounds like a perfect fit for AI - all that supplier website searching and number crunching would indeed be incredibly time-consuming manually.

You mentioned that you do evaluate the ANOVA results using existing statistical software, but it's time-consuming so you're hoping AI can replace that step. How comfortable are you with relying primarily on AI's statistical analysis without that verification step, especially when it's informing which parameters to focus on for your experiments?

User: Without verification could be risky, as wrong result will not just be time consuming but will also make us question everything, from reaction condition to choice of reagent.

AI: Absolutely - when those statistical results are driving your experimental design decisions, getting them wrong would have cascading effects through the whole project.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would hope that AI can do literature search and also learn from existing literatures, but also come with a bit of innovation in terms of route design for novel molecule synthesis. FOr example, it would be nice to provide AI with a starting material and a targeet molecule, it would spew out the synthetic route of it.

AI: That would be incredibly powerful - essentially having AI that could both comprehensively search literature and then creatively design novel synthetic routes based on that knowledge. That sounds like it would transform the early stages of your research process.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions, but your perspectives on how AI fits into complex experimental workflows - particularly that balance between time-saving benefits and the need for verification - were really insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no that was all

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can dramatically speed up tasks like cost estimation and statistical analysis, while also highlighting the real risks of relying on unverified results for critical experimental decisions, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into actual scientific work.

Your point about wanting AI that could do comprehensive literature searches and innovative route design for novel molecules was particularly interesting - that would clearly be a game-changer for the ideation phase of your research.

User: nope sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: a recent project that i worked on was to identify the differences between bootstrap and jackknife variance estimation. I created a setup using different estimation models such as linear regression estimation and ratio estimation, and used simulated data to calculate the variance in order to test efficiency.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting statistical comparison study. Tell me more about that process - how did you go from that initial idea of comparing bootstrap and jackknife methods to actually setting up your simulation and getting your results?

User: It was part of my undergraduate course in survey sampling. I needed to compare bootstrap and jackknife efficiency. The method that I chose was part of an earlier statistics course, and I just wanted to see how the two methods would perform with regards to computational efficiency and theoretical variance.

AI: I see, so this was building on methods you'd learned previously. When you were setting up those simulations and working through the different estimation models - the linear regression and ratio estimation - where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: Coming up with R code to create simulated studies was a big thing. I already had sample code, but I needed to fit it with the specific ratio estimation and linear regression models. So to tweak the sample code, I used AI, mostly to focus more on the report writing over the coding.

AI: That makes sense - using AI to handle the code modifications so you could focus on the analysis and writing. Tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for tweaking that R code.

User: Well I already knew how the math worked behind it, and I had some familiarity with R already. But I didn't really want to rewrite the entire code block over and over again, so i figured it would be more efficient to use AI

AI: So it sounds like efficiency was a key factor - you had the conceptual understanding but wanted to avoid the repetitive coding work. When you used AI for those code modifications, how did you verify or validate what it produced to make sure it was implementing your bootstrap and jackknife methods correctly?

User: The outputs had to make sense obviously. I had a general idea for what I was expecting for the variance estimation for both methods. Since I had a good understanding of R programming, it was pretty straightforward for me to read through the code for any glaring issues. From what I remember, there were a couple of variables that I needed to rename and some loops that I needed to fix for my own purposes. So basically, I used AI to get a 80% complete framework, and I made my edits where I deemed it necessary.

AI: That's a really practical approach - getting that 80% framework and then applying your expertise to refine it. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - maybe the theoretical analysis, the report writing you mentioned, or interpreting your simulation results - what's kept you from trying AI there, or have you experimented with it in those areas too?

User: I really wanted to understand the mathematics behind what I was doing. With the report writing, coding was the easiest part of it. The mathematics was more challenging in that I had to refer to graduate level textbooks to understand what was going on. I also have ethical concerns when it comes to intellectual property, so I didn't want to use AI to write or rewrite something that is already present in a textbook or my professor's lecture notes.

AI: That's really thoughtful - both wanting to truly understand the mathematics yourself and being mindful about intellectual property. Those ethical concerns are interesting. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I'm not sure if there is anything that I actually need out of AI. For me, AI is a convenience tool, I don't really need it to do anything for me. Whatever quality of life improvements it may bring is something I may or may not incorporate, but I'm not going out of my way to look for these improvements. I find that I am pretty self-sufficient in that regard.

AI: That's a really clear perspective on AI as a convenience rather than a necessity. You seem quite intentional about when and how you use it - using it for that R code efficiency but drawing clear boundaries around the mathematical understanding and ethical considerations.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on AI as a quality-of-life tool rather than something essential, and your thoughtful approach to the intellectual property concerns, were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No I don't think so.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for efficiency while maintaining your own deep understanding of the mathematics really help us understand the nuanced way researchers think about integrating these tools into their work. The balance you've struck between leveraging AI as a convenience tool while preserving intellectual integrity is exactly the kind of authentic perspective we're hoping to learn from.

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Sure, a recent research project I've done was building a pediatric cardiac shape atlas from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging models. I used an automated pipeline that performs the segmentation, landmark detection, and guidepoint processing and fitting automatically. This was the first normative reference dataset of pediatric hearts. We analyzed the interpatient differences and have been comparing the use of using this dataset as a normal reference compared to using an adult atlas as a reference cohort.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work with real clinical implications. You mentioned using an automated pipeline for segmentation, landmark detection, and processing - that's quite a sophisticated workflow.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools beyond the automated pipeline you described?

User: I've used AI to help me build out my manuscript for journal submission, to perform some of the data analysis of the models, and suggest new ideas for analysis that would build off of my preexisting data

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI has touched several different aspects of your research process. Let's dig into one of those areas a bit more.

For the manuscript writing part, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: I asked AI to build on a manuscript that I've previously written. I had lots of other tasks to deal with so I used AI to build out the manuscript for me. I also wanted to have the manuscript be written in a sophisticated voice that matches preexisting journal articles

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a way to extend your existing work while maintaining that professional academic tone. 

Now thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I find that AI struggles with some of the more ""niche"" parts of my research. There are areas where the AI completely hallucinates potential solutions and doesn't help at all when developing solutions for these issues. It's much faster and a lot more accurate to continue using traditional approaches

AI: That's a really insightful point about AI struggling with the more specialized aspects of your work. When you have used AI - like for the data analysis or manuscript writing that you mentioned earlier - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: It helps often to have other eyes look at what AI produces. I verify the output myself but also use the eyes of my professors to ensure that the data works well and the manuscript writing makes scientific sense.

AI: That collaborative verification approach sounds really practical. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm curious about your future perspective on this.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be helping me revive and use old tools just by looking at the codebase! There's a lot of older tools to use in my area of research that are not well-documented. They often use legacy versions of code and packages and tend to be very difficult for me to figure out how to use.

AI: That's such a practical and specific need - being able to breathe new life into legacy research tools. I can imagine that's a common frustration across many scientific fields where valuable tools exist but the documentation or compatibility has aged out.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into the more specialized versus general aspects of research work, and especially your insights about verification through collaboration, were particularly illuminating. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Overall, I'm super happy with the advances of AI in my field. It has truly advanced and improved my research experience and I'm excited about the future of AI to further revolutionize research.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing that optimistic perspective - it's clear you're seeing real benefits from AI integration in your work. Your insights about the balance between AI's strengths in general tasks like manuscript writing versus its limitations in highly specialized areas were really valuable. And that point about using legacy codebases is something I suspect many researchers can relate to.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about collaborative verification and the practical ways AI is already enhancing your research productivity really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

User: I'm ready

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

I'd love to start by hearing about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One recent project was to measure how isotopes affect the oscillation frequency of an oscillating chemical reaction, specifically the Briggs-Rauscher reaction.

AI: That sounds fascinating! Tell me more about how that project unfolded - what were the key steps you went through from when you first had that idea to actually getting your results?

User: A student had asked me about this reaction and I suggested checking the literature to see what work had been done on isotopic versions of the reaction. I asked her to do a detailed literature review to see had been done previously.

AI: That's a great starting point. What happened after the literature review - what were the next steps in actually carrying out the research?

User: I did a quick google search myself and didn't come up with much. She did a more in depth search with Deep Research and found an amazing set of papers, but still nothing on isotopic studeis of this reaction.

AI: That's really interesting - so you both did literature searches, but using different approaches. Tell me more about that difference between your quick Google search and her using Deep Research - what made you each choose those different methods?

User: We're all familiar with google searches. They're good starting points and sometimes you get lucky and find exactly what you need, but often times it's just a list of rabbit holes. AI search capabilities are much more directed and directable. There's no comparison in terms of quality of the results - AI is vastly superior.

AI: That's a really compelling comparison. When you say AI search is ""more directed and directable,"" can you give me a specific example of what that looked like for your student with the isotope research?

User: In our case we were looking for multiple parameters simultaneously to both improve the length and depth of the oscillations and to determine how isotope substitutions would alter the reaction. For example, we would specify that Deep Search look for all papers related to a certain chemical indicator that we were using to make the oscillations more visually compelling. This produced a small subset number of very useful papers, in contrast to the vast number of papers on the topic. And it's not just the list of papers that was useful, it's the commentary and summary of each that can really be a time saver.

AI: That level of specificity and the commentary sounds incredibly valuable. Once you had those targeted results and summaries from Deep Research, what was the next phase of your project - how did you move from the literature findings to actually designing and conducting your experiments?

User: Once the chemical indicator issues were sorted out, and because there were so few papers on isotope substitution for this reaction, we just dove into the isotope reaction in the lab. They worked remarkably well.

AI: That's great that the experiments worked well! We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. 

As you moved through the experimental phase and then analyzing your results, did you find yourself using AI tools again, or was that primarily in the initial literature review stage?

User: For this project, the primary use of AI was in the initial phases. We haven't written up these result yet, but it is my expectation that the student will use AI to help with writing the paper. I haven't used AI for this purpose yet, but I would like this student to do so.

AI: That's really interesting - so you see potential for AI in the writing phase even though you haven't used it there yourself yet. What makes you think it would be valuable for your student to try AI for writing up the results, and what's kept you from experimenting with it for that purpose so far?

User: For the student, I think she will benefit from the speed and grammatical/syntactical correctness that AI offers. It can get students closer to a finished product more quickly, which helps to maintain their enthusiasm for the project. In my case, I write fairly mathematical papers, with a lot of quantitative details drawn from multiple fields. I've been a bit reluctant to trust AI with some of these details. I feel like I would send a lot of time correcting small errors. But, worry not - I do plan to use AI for writing more, both proposals and papers.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - speed and engagement for your student versus your concern about accuracy with complex mathematical details. When you do decide to try AI for your more technical writing, how do you think you'll approach verifying or validating what it produces, especially with those quantitative details from multiple fields?

User: I'll approach validation by asking an AI to produce a document of a given content and length, and then I will go through all of it. Fact checking is an essential part of science. This will be fact checking but in a different order than I usually do it.

AI: That's a clever way to think about it - essentially shifting the fact-checking process. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't handle well or at all, what would that be and why?

User: A couple of things. First, the writing style should match my own writing style. Some AI's give an overly bubbly response to a technical question or technical topic. The bot should be capable of reading a few of the authors papers to get a sense of the user's writing style, and incorporate some of that style in their responses. This is most relevant for documents, papers and proposals. Second, the AI should not always be so confident in its errors. Any working scientist keeps a list in their mind of what can go wrong while they're working on something. Perhaps the AI could offer something similar - a way for the use to see where the AI has some uncertainty its response or in the product it has been asked to make.

AI: Those are both really insightful points - matching writing style and being transparent about uncertainty. The idea of an AI showing you where it's less confident, like a scientist's mental list of potential issues, is particularly compelling.

We're wrapping up now. Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI search vastly outperforms traditional methods and your thoughtful approach to validation were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: A capability to read and interpret figures from papers  - but I'm sure progress is being made on this. And also to be able to produce figures from he results of a calculation. I'm sure that too is being worked on.

AI: Those are excellent points - visual interpretation and generation capabilities would really complete the research workflow integration. The ability to analyze figures from literature and then create publication-ready figures from your own data would be incredibly valuable.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI's superiority in targeted literature search and your approach to shifting fact-checking rather than avoiding AI altogether really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you're thinking about maintaining scientific rigor while embracing AI's efficiency is particularly valuable for us to hear.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds great, ask away!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently completed a long term project (a PhD) which was broken down into a number of smaller project. I can talk you though one of the smaller projects as that will take less time. Typically, a project will involve and initial idea that might spawn form a problem or result that we encounter in the lab (this is a wet chemistry lab). For example, I noticed that one of the catalysts we were studying formed a stable intermediate before going on to react further with the reactant. I think took this result to my supervisor and we came up with a rough plan of experiments to try and collect all the data on the intermediate. This plan is fairly standard, involves a number of usual chemistry techniques and forms of data collection, for example,  NMR, X-ray crystallography and IR. After data collection, I would process all the data, then write a report on the results and compare the findings with other similar results from literature. This could all take between 4-8 weeks in total.

AI: That's a really helpful overview - I can see how that process flows from observation to experimentation to analysis and writing. The intermediate catalyst discovery sounds like a fascinating finding.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: During the write up, drafting the final document or asking for tips on paragraph structure. Also, I have experimented with models to assist with condensing text or proof read technical paragraphs. Sometimes, I would write a few options or paragraphs and ask the model to turn it into a single paragraph or summarise the key points.

AI: That's interesting - so you've mainly used AI in the writing and communication phase of your research. 

For those writing tasks you mentioned - like condensing text or proofreading technical paragraphs - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of doing that work yourself or perhaps working with a colleague or supervisor.

User: I decided to use the AI as I find it much faster than my usual approach and the feedback I get on my outputted work has been positive from my colleagues. Typically, other people I work with might try similar tasks and we talk about ways to get the models to produce good outputs in the workplace. Junior roles often involve lots of report writing so this is a way to make that process easier.

AI: That makes sense - the speed advantage and positive feedback would definitely be motivating factors. It sounds like there's even some collaborative learning happening in your workplace around getting good outputs from AI.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the initial idea generation, experimental planning, data collection with NMR and X-ray crystallography, or the data analysis phase - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: There are already methods in place on how I collect, store, process all that data. There may be routes to improving these with AI tools but at the moment I don't feel any reason to change. These are typically the more interesting aspect of my work and I enjoy how I do them. Additionally, they don't take up as much time as the writing so a tool might take a long time to learn but if i only spend a few minutes preparing an NMR and processing the data, and additional tool wouldn't effect how I do it. Additionally, some of my work involves manual processes so models can't help too much. I have used AI to produce code that will extract data form Excel sheets but sometimes the effort to get that up and running isn't worth this time. (for example if i don't have huge amounts of data, it doesn't take long to just do everything maunally)

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like you've considered the time investment versus benefit trade-off quite carefully. The point about enjoying those core experimental aspects of your work is particularly interesting.

When you have used AI for writing tasks - like condensing text or proofreading those technical paragraphs - how do you verify or validate what it produces before you use it in your final work?

User: Compare the results to textbooks. Also, I have a fairly deep understanding of these topics so I have a feeling if something is being oversimplified or overlooked. Additionally, other colleagues will read the work and they all have different points of view/backgrounds and knowledge.

AI: That's a solid approach - using your domain expertise as a filter and having that peer review layer. It sounds like you have multiple checkpoints in place.

We're about two-thirds of the way through now. Here's a hypothetical for you: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Create deep literature reviews and recommend papers based on what I am reading. It can be hard to find papers and a junior researcher. Would be good to keep seeing other people's work in my field from the past 30+ years. Also, creating graphs for papers that link together would be interesting to see. For example, how two similar fields link (for example copolymerisation of styrene and scandium sandwich complexes)

AI: That's fascinating - essentially having AI help you map the intellectual landscape of your field and discover connections you might not have found otherwise. The idea of visualizing how different research areas link together sounds really powerful for a junior researcher trying to understand the broader context.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how you've thoughtfully integrated AI into the writing phase while preserving the experimental work you enjoy, and your approach to validation through domain expertise and peer review, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think that's everything thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the trade-offs between time investment and benefit, and especially your point about preserving the enjoyable, intellectually engaging parts of your research while using AI to streamline the more routine writing tasks, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Your vision for AI-assisted literature mapping also highlights an interesting gap - the need for tools that can help researchers navigate and discover connections in the vast landscape of scientific knowledge.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions I think I understand

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: What I have been working on recently is attempting to attach the beta-lactamase enzyme to  various different nanopores created with both controlled breakdown and EBL. The aim for this is to be able to use the AC nanopore to detect beta-lactamase funcitonality. By learning the chemical signatures for beta-lactamse activity this way which we have been able to do by attaching the enzyme next to the nanopore. Our goal is to next implement it into a sensor clinicians can use for antibiotic resistance testing. So the initial

AI: That sounds like really fascinating work with important clinical applications. So you started with the idea of using nanopores to detect beta-lactamase activity, then moved through the process of creating the nanopores, attaching the enzymes, and learning those chemical signatures. 

Can you tell me a bit more about what those middle steps looked like - the actual experimental work and analysis phases before getting to where you are now with the sensor development?

User: Yes so sorry I will type in a separate window so I do not send before I am ready. We started with EBL because that is what our lab traditionally uses but then we found some articles (with AI) discussing using CBD for the nanopore creation because it allows you to make more high throughput sensors easier with lots of nanopores together. Plus, the set ups are not too expensive so we then set up one of those.
After we figured out how we would make our nanopores we had to decide how to attach our enzyme of interest without denaturing it somehow and messing up its ability to function and break apart antibiotic molecules. In previous research in my lab group we have used Gold nanoparticles for this type of attachment so that is what I got trained on for the attachment phase. There were a few different types of chemistry I tested in order to try to have the best enzyme attachment. I tried to use click chemistry, PEG-Maleimide + Cysteine-Tagged β-lactamase, and Thiol Gold. I had the best results in terms of active enzyme yield from PEG-M + Cys. Then I would expose the nanopores to solutions with beta-lactam and collected data on its activity with the AC nanopore. I trained an ML model on data from that and was able to improve my recognition levels of Beta-lactamase in the solution.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - thank you for walking through those steps. I'm particularly interested in a couple of things you mentioned. 

You said you found articles about using CBD for nanopore creation ""with AI"" - can you tell me more about that? What did using AI look like in that literature search process?

User: I explained what I wanted the nanopore for and did a deep research using chatgpt to help me collect sources and found solutions for potentially creating more high throughput, cheaper, and easier to make sensors

AI: Tell me more about that deep research process with ChatGPT. How did you approach that - what did you ask it, and how did you work together to find those solutions?

User: It was not super detailed I think I explained the goal of the project in rather crude terms and then asked for a collection of potential papers along with summaries of each of them so I could tell if I wanted to dive more into those methods and it found some good ones from a few years ago that were superhelpful and gave me the CBD method, and suggested the different attachment methods to work with

AI: That's really helpful to understand. So we're about a third of the way through our conversation now, and I'm curious - in that research process you just described, how did you decide to use ChatGPT for the literature search versus doing it through more traditional methods like PubMed or Google Scholar?

User: I generally prefer to use AI in general for these types of deep literary searches because it can synthesise information so quickly and serve as a great diving board into various sources. What makes it great is I can start like I said at sort of a surface level when it comes to these different ideas and then dive deep into the ones that I think sound the most apt instead of reading those papers myself and potentially losing details. Thus, I think having AI as a partner when it comes to this type of literary search is really quite helpful. At the same time I would not let it do the entire literary search for me without me double checking sources because sometimes I notice when reading through the sources it finds that it slightly misunderstood them

AI: That's a great point about it sometimes misunderstanding sources. When you do go back to double-check, what kinds of misunderstandings have you noticed, and how do you catch them?

User: Gosh that is a bit hard because it varies usually but generally from what I have noticed is context issues like taking a phrase out of context and making slight mistakes because of it. However, it is not super common just sometimes especially in articles with weird formatting or lots of tables and figures

AI: That makes sense - context and formatting issues can definitely trip up AI systems. Now thinking about the other parts of your research workflow - the experimental design, the actual lab work, the data analysis where you trained that ML model - where else in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I actually have not used AI tools much when it comes to data analysis I think if I did I would use it to verify my conclusions because so much of data analysis is telling a story about the data you found and I don't know if AI always knows which story to tell. For the ML model training I worked with some people from our group who are more of computer scientists than me they may have used AI but I am unsure I do not think so. If I was left to create and train the ML model completely on my own I think I would use AI much more heavily as I am not a strong in terms of computer science skills as I am in experimentation workflow creation. Thus, I think I have primarily used AI at the front end of experimentation but not as much in further parts of experiments because I am wary of how it may impact my results

AI: That's really insightful - you're making a distinction between using AI for exploratory work versus the parts that directly impact your results. You mentioned being wary about how AI might impact your results in the later stages. Can you tell me more about that wariness - what specifically concerns you about using AI in those parts of your research?

User: Well for example lets say I use AI to create a figure whenever I want to write up my results I don't want to look silly by having some sort of silly mistake in the figure where the data is misrepresented or for my figures to look wildly different from eachother for some reason. The times I have tried to use AI for data analysis it is just a bit to random in terms of how it creates figures for example to use. Additionally, I think using AI to check over my writing is a good idea but having it write the whole thing makes me feel like I am no longer the one steering the conclusions drawn from my research

AI: That really gets to something important - you want to maintain control over how your research story gets told and how your data gets represented. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - beyond those data analysis and writing concerns you mentioned - what else has kept you from trying AI in other areas?

User: Certain parts of the research process are unfortunately just not compatible with AI even though they are the part that would be most convenient to automate like running experiments. I also do not think using AI for a peer review makes sense as AI is not my peer. Experimentation and research is also an inherently up to me in some ways like what type of questions to ask and get answers to them. I think something that might be convenient is having an ethics bot that double checks experiment designs against general guidelines and highlights grey areas for the user to reason through on their own. However, I have not used something like thus far in my research.

AI: I like that ethics bot idea - that sounds like it could be really useful for flagging considerations you might want to think through. We're nearing the end of our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I think the thing I notice most that annoys me is when I ask for suggestions on my writings in the final stages of my work and AI models tend to always want to find something to improve. So, often when I ask if there is anything left to improve  it makes it sort of like a hedonic treadmill of fixing things and then fixing more things until I start just switching back and forth between things the AI says I need to fix that are really sort of preference. So it would be really nice to have AI models that give me one final overarching list of things to fix within my writing instead of an endless supply of potential things I could change. Maybe in practice having one or two checking steps and then having the AI affirm that everything looks good. 

I have noticed that there are definitely problems with using AI for final checks as well I wish it was able to better tie together scientific documents and make suggestions that keep them from being overly robotic.

AI: That's a really perceptive observation about the ""hedonic treadmill"" effect - AI always finding something to tweak even when your work might actually be ready. That endless cycle of revisions sounds frustrating.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on using AI as a research partner in the early stages while being more cautious about maintaining control over your conclusions and results were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think that having a dedicated frame work of models with slightly different system instructions for each step within the research process would be so good for implementing AI better for research work. I don't necessarily always have time to adjust all the parameters of the model to my liking by prompting it and this could make things much faster and help provide nice punctuation between steps of the research process

AI: That's a brilliant idea - having specialized models tailored for different research phases could really address that friction you mentioned about having to constantly re-prompt and adjust the AI for each task. It sounds like it would help maintain those clear boundaries you want between exploration and analysis phases too.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research partner early on while maintaining control over your conclusions, and especially that observation about the endless revision cycle, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good, let's begin!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project I worked on involved drafting a research proposal for a scientific study about how dogs and cats learn communicate with each other within a household. I brainstormed for a while to come to that topic. Then I had to find published scientific research that was related to behavior and forms of communication that have been documented about dogs, cats, and any research related to them communicating with each other and the species coexisting. Following the background research, I had to come up with a specific question that could be tested and I had to make a strategy for how communication between the species could be tracked over time, studied, and accurately documented, as documenting behaviors requires a different approach than gathering and documenting numerical data does, for example. I had to finish up the research proposal by explaining the significance of the research.

AI: That's a fascinating topic - the communication between dogs and cats in households sounds like it would involve some really complex behavioral observations.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I mainly only used AI tools to help with the beginning stages of my research project, where I was brainstorming many topics related to animals to get to this topic, as well as trying to narrow down what exactly I wanted to learn from the study. I think I occasionally used AI tools to help with clarity/conciseness in my phrasing and proof-reading, also.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for brainstorming and narrowing down your research focus - what did that interaction look like?

User: I started out by asking the AI to help me think of animal-related topics that could be used for a research project. I don't remember specifics about the conversation anymore, but I do remember the AI giving some good ideas for species and potential topics. Eventually, I settled on my topic because it was the most practical and realistic topic that I came up with, with the help of the AI. I also remember asking the AI for help incorporating other feedback I had received, while sticking to the process and research methods I wanted to use, by explaining my vision for the study and asking the AI for help incorporating what other scientists had mentioned throughout the different drafts of my project, without losing my main focuses and goals for the project.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. For those brainstorming and feedback incorporation tasks, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach - what made you think ""I'll try AI for this""?

User: Before AI, I would just have to try to figure out if/how to incorporate feedback on my own, or maybe ask friends for help with reviewing feedback and incorporating good feedback in a way that made sense, but my friends aren't scientists, so there's only so much they can really help with. I thought it would be good to ask AI for help with some of these situations because sometimes, it can be hard to reflect on your own work and find things that could be tweaked or changed because in my mind, I understand everything I want to get from the research and I can ""see the vision,"" but others might not quite be imagining things the same way I am or may be glazing over certain aspects that don't seem very relevant to them, but with my background knowledge, I know they are very important aspects of the research. Being able to put all my thoughts, ideas, and background details into an AI model, along with parts of my paper and feedback I received, and being able to say, ""How can I make this aspect of my project more clear and easier for people outside the project to understand if they were reading this?"" or ""How can I make it more clear to readers that this part is an essential part of the research?"" is really helpful, and isn't really possible to do with things other than AI.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI filled a specific gap where you needed someone who could understand the technical context but also provide that outside perspective on clarity. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the literature review, developing your methodology, or explaining the significance - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: Literature review is definitely a topic I would have liked to use AI to help with, because I can envision AI really being able to streamline background research by finding literature that is relevant to specific topics and picking out the relevant information much more quickly than a human would be able to. What stopped me in this case was that AI wouldn't have access to a lot of the scientific research I was using because the databases are behind paywalls, university websites, etc.
As for explaining methodology and significance, I probably used AI a bit to make sure my project sounded clear, concise, and kept a professional, scientific tone throughout (I don't quite remember specifics), but for this specific topic, I didn't need as much help with actual brainstorming of the methodology and significance as I might need for other topics. I think AI could be great to use for help with methodology or explaining significance, so it wasn't due to any potential shortcomings in AI that I didn't happen to use it much here.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the paywall barrier is a really practical limitation. You mentioned you did use AI a bit for tone and clarity in those sections. 

When you've used AI for brainstorming topics or incorporating feedback, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I knew enough about the topic and the plans I had for my research to know whether or not I wanted to incorporate what AI provided in those situations. I didn't use AI for finding specific information or making claims/statements I didn't already have backed up with scientific sources, so it was really just a matter of using AI for advice and to guide my thought process. So, in my case, it wasn't really about ""verifying"" or ""validating"" what the AI came up with, it was more-so just a question of if I wanted to incorporate some of the ideas the AI came up with, or if it could give me an idea for changing phrasing or structure for clarity/

AI: That's a great distinction - using AI more as a thinking partner rather than an information source. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: As we talked about earlier, I think the literature review process could be an amazing way to use AI and I hope, in the future, that it could be possible to use AI in this way- it would save so much time digging through articles that look like they might be helpful, but in the end, are not, or maybe only have a tiny bit of relevant info. Of course, I would still want to verify that the sources found by AI are correct, relevant, and ensure the AI hasn't hallucinated or extrapolated information from sources- I would always fact-check, just in case. But again, I'm not sure how realistic that is, knowing that paywalls and other barriers exist that would simply not allow the AI to access the sources it needs to.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a thinking partner rather than an information source, and the practical barriers around literature access were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: That is all I can think of for now! I definitely think in science fields, it is important for scientists to not rely on AI to do all their work for them, but as you said, it can be incorporated as a great thinking partner to make the entire process go a bit more smoothly and to have someone there to bounce ideas off of and get advice from when needed! I hope my feedback is useful!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about AI serving as a thinking partner - helping with brainstorming, incorporating feedback, and providing that outside perspective on clarity - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you made between using AI for guidance versus information sourcing was especially valuable.

Your point about the literature review challenges also highlights an important gap between what would be most useful and what's currently accessible due to practical barriers like paywalls.

This has been incredibly helpful for our research. If you have any questions about this study or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The latest research project that I've worked on is the distribution of mitragynine (MTRG for here on out) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MTRG from here on out) in post mortem kratom deaths. I work at a medical examiner's office in the toxicology department. We are seeing a rise in high doses of kratom, in some cases the sole cause of death. We wanted to see the concentration of MTRG and 7-OH-MTRG in femoral, heart, subclavian, and chest blood in relation to dosage. We procured multiple samples from the morgue as the pathologists preformed autopsies. We collected data over the course of a year and then crunched the data.

AI: That's fascinating research with important public health implications. Tell me more about what that data crunching process looked like - how did you go from having all those blood samples and concentration measurements to your final analysis?

User: We use liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LC/MS) to quantitate the samples. We used cold acetonitrile to crash the proteins out of the blood, as well as internal standard. We used a calibration curve to give us a value of the MTRG and 7-OH-MTRG. We then used a spread sheet to organize blood types, concentrations, and drug effects. Once we completed the year long study, we analyzed the distribution pasterns.

AI: That sounds like a very methodical process. When you got to that final stage of analyzing the distribution patterns in your spreadsheet data - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: We have touched on using AI tools, however, it was not extensive. I attempted to have our tools pull out different patterns that we could not analyze by visual examination.

AI: Tell me more about that - what specific patterns were you hoping the AI might identify that weren't visible through your visual examination?

User: Anything really. The tool did show us that there was a relationship between distribution of MTRG/7-OH-MTRG, time between death and usage, and concentration. For example, once the drug was in the system for more than 30 minutes prior to death, there was a 10:1 ratio between MTRG:7-OH-MTRG. Furthermore, there was a ratio of distribution between femoral blood and subclavian/heart/chest that was around 2:1 ratio. This helps us understand how long ago a drug was taken, what the dosage was, and what the effects are.

AI: That's really compelling - those ratios sound like they could be quite valuable for forensic analysis. For this pattern recognition task, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of visual examination and manual analysis.

User: I am tasked with implementation of AI, python scripts, and VBA equations. We were given a 2 week license to an AI subscription, so I was trying out the tool in every capacity I was able to. We did also use analysts to blindly pattern match. We found that some analysts could detect the femoral to other blood ratio, while others were able to find the 10:1 ratio in some instances. However, the tool was the only method we were able to relate both AND the time of death dosage difference.

AI: That's really interesting that the AI was able to find relationships that even your experienced analysts couldn't consistently identify. We're about one-third of the way through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like the initial sample processing with LC/MS or setting up your calibration curves - what's kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: Those are both historically studied and known methods. While someone with little LC experience could use the software, everyone in the lab performs these type of duties and extractions on a daily basis.

AI: That makes sense - you rely on established, validated methods for those core analytical processes. When you did use AI for that pattern recognition work, how did you verify or validate what it produced - especially since it was finding relationships that your analysts couldn't consistently detect?

User: Once it was brought to the forefront, we could easily see the patterns. Almost like muddy water becoming clear, in a sense. Now that we have established the ratios, we have incorporated them in our SOPs.

AI: That's a great analogy - the AI helping to clarify what was already there but hard to see. We're nearing the end of our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love to AI assistance in terms of project assignment. Some assays are longer and more involved than others. This causes man hour issues where some analysts will work 30 man hours worth of bench work, while others work 10. This disparity is VERY difficult to manage while the assay list is so dynamic.

AI: That's a really practical need - workload distribution and resource management across your lab. It sounds like the complexity and variability of different assays makes it challenging to balance fairly.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI for pattern detection in forensic toxicology and the potential for workflow optimization were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, I think we've hit all the major points, effectively.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI revealed those critical time-based ratios that are now part of your standard operating procedures really help us understand how AI can uncover patterns that skilled analysts might miss, even in highly specialized forensic work. The practical challenges you mentioned around workload management also highlight how AI applications extend beyond just data analysis into operational aspects of research.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! It was really enlightening to hear about your work in forensic toxicology and how you're exploring AI applications in such a critical field. Take care!"
science_0105,"Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! No questions, I am ready to begin

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: As a student researcher, many of my project themes are decided for me. The initial idea came from my supervisor, who was looking to study growth hormone in rodents at different periods of time. This project was very heavy on both preparation and data analysis, because the main part of the analysis of the rodents unfortunately required histological brain images. As a student, I had to learn appropriate handling of lab mice, as well as the procedures which were necessary for the project. This is where I used quite a bit of AI to help me. I would frequently use AI to both help me learn, and to help me recall some of the techniques I had learned during my Undergraduate studies. These techniques were either for handling the lab mice, or for research techniques, like running a centrifuge or running immunofluorescence assays. The final output was the data analysis, for which I used a small amount of AI only for organization and summarization, rarely (if ever) for actual analysis.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you turned to AI primarily during the learning and preparation phases. 

Tell me more about how you used AI to help you learn the lab techniques. What did that actually look like in practice?

User: As one of the more inexperienced researchers in the lab, I felt the need to rely on step by step instructions for certain lab techniques. One instance I remember well was the preparation of a polyacrylamide gel for SDS-PAGE. I needed to prepare a gel, and later run it. I was on a pretty tight time constraint for this task as well, so I asked for the help of AI for a step-by-step instruction on how to make the polyacrylamide gel, and then another one of how to run the SDS-PAGE. I had given the AI as much information as possible for background information, like prior lab notes and excerpts from lab textbooks, but I requested explicitly a step-by-step guide, because at the time I was feeling a bit lost.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that step-by-step guidance when you're under time pressure and feeling uncertain must have been reassuring.

When you were deciding whether to ask AI for those instructions versus asking a lab mate or looking it up in a protocol book, what made you choose the AI route?

User: I had been on a roll of using AI quite a bit at this point of the project, and I was appreciating the consistency. I wanted to use the project to learn, and there were several tasks which I would ask for help from my supervisor or one of my lab mates for assistance, namely when making histological slides. The protocol book had not yielded good results for me, so while I was looking on my computer for some of my old notes, I had AI tabs open and I decided to use a bit of prompt engineering. One of the major reasons I appreciate AI is because it is more malleable. My notes and the protocol book are set in stone, however I am able to get AI to rephrase or to go in depth on something specific within seconds.

AI: That's a great insight about the malleability being a key advantage - being able to get immediate clarification or different explanations on demand.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Let me shift focus a bit - you mentioned you used AI less for the actual data analysis phase. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI much, what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I havent used AI for data analysis because I am unsure of the results it will yield, and the only way to confirm/deny the results from AI is to repeat the work myself, so it feels pointless to ask an AI. I feel this to be the case for subjective things, like data analysis, analysis of results and charts and things like that, because an AI can so easily misinterpret data, or numbers or reading a chart that it feels too risky. I feel this for clinical analysis as well, such as histological slides, X-rays or CT-scans. I have not tried it for two reasons, the first being I will have to do the work to determine if the AI is correct or not, and two because using AI will not help me learn, it will just give me the answer.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - between tasks where AI can help you learn versus tasks where you need to develop your own analytical skills.

When you have used AI for those step-by-step procedures like the SDS-PAGE, how do you verify or validate what it produces? How do you know you can trust those instructions?

User: SDS-PAGE and other procedures are set in stone. There are no real variables, subjectivity or interpretation to be done. The AI can easily absorb information of how to perform an SDS-PAGE and repeat it back in a different format (such as a step by step procedure) which allows me to trust it more. The analysis of an SDS-PAGE will be done by myself, but I trust AI to help me with the preparation, which is much more low stakes,, and easy to confirm by the success of the experiment so if it doesn't work I can simply redo it.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the procedural steps have clear success or failure outcomes that validate whether the AI guidance worked.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I use AI a lot for writing and brainstorming, helping me choose techniques and research methods to follow through on hypotheses I or another researcher have formulated. If I had a magic wand, it would be definitely improvement of AI brainstorming capabilities, by diving into the unknown and helping us with the formation of these hypotheses. There are many disease mechanisms we do not fully understand, so if we could use AI to help us formulate new hypotheses or new lab techniques to help us, it may speed up the discovery of novel mechanisms which may be able to stop diseases. The other would also be data analysis, being able to string together several pieces of data to formulate a conclusion. Whether it be statistical data, or previously mentioned physical data like medical imagery. This would facilitate patient care and accelerate research.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how you distinguish between procedural tasks where AI can be trusted versus analytical tasks that require human judgment were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think we've touched on just about everything for my research work!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how the ""set in stone"" nature of lab procedures makes them ideal for AI assistance, while the subjective aspects of data analysis require human expertise, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

Your point about wanting AI to eventually help with hypothesis formation and connecting disparate data points also gives us valuable perspective on where you see the most exciting potential for advancement.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, I am ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The last (finished) research project I have worked on was looking at serum metabolites in Jersey and Holstein calves, and seeing how socialization impacted their nutrition and growth

AI: That sounds like a fascinating study! Can you walk me through what that research process actually looked like day-to-day? How did you go from that initial idea about socialization's impact on calf nutrition and growth to your final results?

User: Yes, I was actually piggy-backing off of a different student and professor project that was measuring behavior and socialization.  While I was helping monitoring the behaviors of calves in playgroups some serum samples were taken from the calves, and I used those to gather my data.  They were taken pretty much every week, and I used those samples to run assays like BHB and Haptoglobin, as well as looking at the weekly weigh-ins for each of the calves.

AI: So you had this opportunity to use existing samples and data from the behavioral study - that's a smart approach! Tell me more about what happened after you collected all that assay data and weight measurements. How did you go about analyzing everything and putting together your findings?

User: This project was a bit too small to write a paper (the main project did get published however), but I did present a poster.  I used R to do most of the data analysis, and excel to create graphs and visuals that I put on the poster, as well as for organizing all of the data.

AI: Got it - so you used R for the statistical analysis and Excel for organizing data and creating visuals for your poster presentation. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I was not very proficient in AI yet at this point so I didn't use it too extensively, but I did use it to get some background information on some of the assays I would run.  I also used it when designing my poster to ensure that the information on it was written well.  My poster was presented at a research symposium, so it was being viewed by faculty and students alike.  I wanted to make sure that everyone could understand the research and results, without it being too ""dumbed down"", and AI helped me refine my wording and provided feedback.  I made sure never to use exclusively AI to get information however, and to always double-check my sources.

AI: That's really interesting - you used AI as a research assistant for background information and as a writing coach for your poster presentation. 

For the poster writing specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for refining that content.

User: I didn't use AI to determine what information to put on the poster; I consulted professors and other experts about their recommendations.  I mostly used AI to determine what the best wording for a phrase would be, and where emphasis should be placed.  Overall, I did use it very sparingly, and relied more heavily on looking at past posters and getting advice from more knowledgable parties.

AI: That makes sense - you kept the content decisions in human hands but used AI more as a writing tool for refining language and emphasis. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you didn't use AI - like the statistical analysis in R or interpreting your assay results - what kept you from trying it there?

User: Nervousness mainly.  I didn't understand AI quite as well as I do now, and didn't know where it excelled and where it fell short.  I was also not as proficient at data analysis at the time, and I felt wary of relying on AI when I may not be able to tell if it's reasoning was faulty or it was hallucinating.

AI: That nervousness about not being able to catch potential errors makes a lot of sense, especially when you're still building your own expertise in data analysis. 

When you did use AI for background information on the assays, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced?

User: I mainly asked the chatbot broad questions like ""what is [assay] used to measure?"" and ""how does [assay] work?"" and then based on the responses, I was able to search more specific questions on google scholar and other direct sources

AI: So you used AI as a starting point to understand the landscape, then did the deep-dive research through traditional academic sources. That's a thoughtful verification approach.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Good question.  I think I would like it to be able to critique my experimental design and analysis.  Essentially, I would like it to act like a peer-reviewer

AI: That's a really compelling vision - having AI serve as a peer reviewer for experimental design and analysis. What specifically about that peer review process would be most valuable to you? Is it catching methodological issues, suggesting alternative approaches, or something else entirely?

User: Mostly catching methodical issues, logical errors, or things I may have overlooked.  Since research is often so time-consuming and expensive, it would be very valuable to have fool-proof way of making sure my design is sound before I spend the resources on it.

AI: That makes perfect sense - having that safety net before committing significant time and resources could be huge for research efficiency.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI cautiously as a complement to traditional research methods, and your vision for AI as a methodological reviewer, were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so, although I am sure as time goes on my usages for AI in research will evolve along with the technology.

AI: That's a great point - the relationship between researchers and AI is clearly still evolving as both the technology and users' comfort levels develop.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about taking that cautious, verification-focused approach to AI integration - especially your strategy of using it as a starting point for deeper research rather than an endpoint - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you balanced leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining scientific rigor was particularly valuable to hear about.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good Claude. No questions from me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your research background. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I have worked in a little over 20 research projects. Some have come to fruition, some are published, some had to be scrapped for one reason or another. My most recent projects are three systematic review articles which are still in manuscript drafting stages. The initial idea came from my research group where my attending and senior resident recommended I perform literature searches for specific rare pathologies and treatment modalities. For those I performed database searches to understand if there was paucity in the literature and to determine why we care about the topic and why does it matter? Once I had that information in a short protocol draft, I performed metadata extraction into a citation manager, then I did deduplication, followed by title screening, abstract screening, and finally full text review.

AI: That's a really thorough process - systematic reviews require such meticulous attention to each stage. It sounds like you're managing quite a bit of data and repetitive tasks between the database searches, deduplication, and multiple rounds of screening.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: As a medical student, efficiency and time management are key. As such, I have utilized AI to assist me in a variety of ways in these, and past, research projects. I have utilized AI to assist with brainstorming, to-do list creation, medical database query creation, protocol outline drafting, protocol edition, finding sources, and reviewing manuscripts for unsubstantiated claims.

AI: That's quite a range of applications across your workflow! It sounds like AI has become integrated into multiple stages of your research process.

Let me focus on one specific area - when you mentioned using AI for medical database query creation, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for crafting those searches.

User: Initially I had the support of staff librarians to assist me with query creation. However, this is very impractical, especially considering how many projects end up being scrapped for one reason or another. Given my little experience with query creation, AI offered an opportunity to both learn how to create these queries and also generate them for me, taking off a time-consuming aspect of research from my shoulders. Of course, it still requires manual review and approval from my mentors before submission or proceeding with the full search for a project, but it serves at least as a base to build from. AI also offers instantaneous generation of search queries for different databases. For example, if I want to find information about a topic in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase, I would need to create four different queries respecting the rules for each database, which is likely to be time-consuming. I can simply craft a strong prompt and have an AI assist me on it while I simply review and edit accordingly.

AI: That's a really practical example - the ability to translate queries across different database syntax rules sounds like a huge time saver. And I appreciate how you mentioned the manual review step with your mentors.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: A major area where I have not tried AI is in manuscript drafting. However, this is something where the line with dishonesty can become very thin and blurry and I prefer to type my own words, even if AI helps me refine it later on, but still with my human voice behind my work. Another area where I have not tried it is in citation generation and bibliography generation. The current models are still too likely to undergo hallucinations and instruction following issues, making citation generation a too delicate process to have the AI fully handle. In other words, sure it is time consuming to hunt down and write citations, but it will take even longer when the AI messes up one of the citations and now the researcher has to fix the entire citation system for a manuscript. Lastly, all the models I have worked with have a tendency to produce impractical experimental designs that, even assuming I had all the resources available, would still be unreasonable to justify the means for the goal. for example, a model once suggested manually gathering the data on all orthopedic residents who graduated in the past 10 years to compare their research output, which was unrealistic since this would be well over 9000 data points and the model recommended doing so over 2 months.

AI: Those are really thoughtful distinctions you're making about where the risks outweigh the benefits. The citation hallucination issue is something I hear about frequently - that verification burden can definitely exceed any time savings.

When you have used AI for tasks like protocol drafting or manuscript review, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: manual review. Any and all of my work is verified by me. All final versions are human, despite AI assistance. in other words, you could say the AI helps me more in organizing, writing, and applying the content from citations rather than the AI working independently without my supervision.

AI: That's a clear approach - keeping human oversight at every stage while using AI more as an organizational and writing assistant.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious about your future vision here - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: ACCURATE Literature review and citation hunting with the AI having full access to the major medical databases (either through institutional log-in or other methods). This is a major part of the research process, but it is also one of the most time-consuming ones. Reality is, researchers are pressed for time. Let it be the research race in medicine or in PhD fields, we have to published and we have to do so fast and efficiently. Spending two afternoons after clinic writing up a research protocol just to find that someone else wrote a literature review about it 1 month ago can be a major source of time that could have been utilized for another purpose.

AI: That's such a practical pain point - the time investment versus the risk of duplication. The idea of AI having real-time access to comprehensive databases to catch existing work early in the process could really change how efficiently researchers can navigate the literature landscape.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on balancing efficiency with accuracy, and especially your clear boundaries around where AI fits versus where human judgment is essential, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no, that would be it unless you have other questions, Claude. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as an organizational and writing assistant while maintaining strict human oversight, and especially your point about the need for accurate, real-time database access to prevent duplicated efforts, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's clear you've developed a thoughtful approach to leveraging AI's strengths while being very aware of its limitations - particularly around citation accuracy and the importance of maintaining your authentic voice in manuscript writing.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Sure, although the nature of my work is somewhat sensitive and I've signed NDA's so I'll have to be vague about some of the details and the direct purpose of the research. However, I can still provide you with valuable insight about how we used AI during the research process.

AI: Absolutely, I completely understand about the NDAs and sensitive nature of your work. Please share only what you're comfortable with - even speaking generally about the process and your AI experiences will be incredibly valuable for our research.

So with those considerations in mind, could you walk me through that recent project from start to finish?

User: Overview and Background
Yes, our most recent research project involved synthesizing data from multiple real-world physical sensing devices for the purpose of classifying real-world phenomena occurring in range of the sensors.

All the preliminary sensor data as well as correct classifications of the phenomena were provided to us. It was up to us to develop an algorithm that could effectively synthesize sensor data of the types provided and form accurate predictions of the phenomena.

We had recent success in several other physics and sensor related applications making use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), so our initial thought was to see if we could design a GNN algorithm to synthesize this sensor data as well.

Initial Steps:
First off, using the descriptions of the data provided to us as well as the data files themselves, we utilized ChatGPT to write several small data analysis scripts in Python. These scripts allowed us to visualize/summarize important qualities of the data, including the precise format of the data, statistics, the way the data evolved overtime for each sensor, as well as some anomalies in the data that seemed to differ from the description of the data that was provided to us with the data.

Addressing Anomalies:
We spent some time discussing the anomalies and the possible meanings they could have. We came to a conclusion about what we thought was most likely the cause of the anomalies. We emailed to the dataset provider with our findings, and continued our research under the assumptions we made. We later confirmed that the assumptions we made about the dataset were corrcet.

Algorithm Development:
After developing our understanding of the dataset came the design of the GNN algorithm. We ended up settling on a design that placed each node of the graph as a point in 2D space within the region that the sensors were operating (the sensors did not give us any sort of vertical positioning data). The algorithm was designed to work in real-time as sensor data was acquired, although, since we had all the sensor data ahead of time, we simulated the real-time process by feeding the algorithm sensor data in the order of their timestamps. Whenever new sensor data was received by the algorithm, a check would be done proximal to the location of the sensor data. If there were no graph nodes within a certain distance of the sensor inputs, a new node would be created. If there was already a node nearby, the ""signal strength"" of that node would be increased. Overtime, the ""signal strength"" of each node would decay if no new sensor inputs were detected near the node.

Each node in the graph was a small classification neural network that took as input the data of each sensor input close to the node, as well as the outputs of nearby nodes from the previous timestep, augmented by the signal strength of those nodes as well as the distance of that node to the current node.

An evolutionary algorithm was used to train the network. All the main algorithm code was written by hand, so to speak, but the scripts used to test and tune the various hyperparameters of the network were also written using ChatGPT.

Algorithm Tuning and Conclusion
We continued the process of hyperparameter tuning and even tried out 2 additional methods for binning and pre-processing sensor inputs across time. We eventually arrived on an algorithm and hyperparameters that resulted in 92% prediction success. We wrote a document describing our process and findings (not assisted by AI) and submitted our work, but we were not selected for the next phase of the project.

AI: That's a fascinating project - the combination of GNNs with real-time sensor data synthesis sounds quite complex. I'm particularly interested in how you integrated AI tools into your workflow.

You mentioned using ChatGPT for writing data analysis scripts and hyperparameter tuning scripts. When you were deciding whether to use ChatGPT for those specific tasks versus writing the code yourself, what factors influenced that decision?

User: The main factors were time and prior experience using ChatGPT to write code. The first phase of the project was given a relatively small timeframe and we also had to balance some of regular workload during that time frame. Our team was pretty small (myself, our team lead, and one other programmer), and I was the only one who had prior experience using AI to write code.In my experience, using AI models to write code is effective, but is made less effective by the following:
-High levels of integration with existing code (AKA coupling)
-Long prompts
-Highly detailed/complex prompts
-Topics pertaining to highly nuanced or cutting edge research

The more of these factors are present in your prompt the more likely it is that the AI's code will contain mistakes. The more mistakes the AI's code contains, the more likely it will be that the code could've been completed faster if the AI was forgone in the first place.

Given these heuristics, I felt that trying to use AI for any of the main algorithm code would likely be detrimental, but using it to write the more one-off and sometimes repetitive code used for data analysis/visualization and hyperparameter tuning was a safe bet for saving time and effort. The AI was very effective in helping us in this way.

AI: Those are really insightful heuristics you've developed. It sounds like you've built up a practical framework for when AI coding assistance is worth it versus when it might slow you down.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you didn't use AI - like the main algorithm development and the final document writing - what specifically kept you from trying it there?

User: The complexity, length, and relative novelty of  the GNN algorithm. For one, we hadn't fully articulated the design of the algorithm in a way we could confidently give to an AI model. It was more-so an iterative process of drawing diagrams on paper/whiteboard, discussions, and then writing small pieces of code. By the time we could precisely articulate the whole design, we had most of the code already written. Additionally, we felt the GNN was a new enough concept in the literature that it would easily be confused with the highly popular Deep Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, which are themselves graphs, although not necessarily Graph Neural Networks in the way we were using.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the iterative, exploratory nature of developing something novel doesn't lend itself well to AI assistance when you're still figuring out the design through trial and discussion.

When you did use ChatGPT for those data analysis and hyperparameter tuning scripts, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced? What was your process for making sure the code was doing what you needed it to do?

User: Scanning over the AI's code, the results of running the code on our dataset, and running a couple of simpler proof of concept inputs through the code to which I new the expected output for.

AI: That's a thorough verification approach - checking the code itself, the actual results, and testing with known inputs. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Debugging and or understanding large (and especially highly integrated) codebases. Our main work involves a large legacy code base that uses FORTRAN physics code from the 80's, a 12-year old C++ front-end, and a variety of Python tools designed to quickly extend the capabilities of both. It's incredibly difficult to grok even large chunks of the base, it gets changed all the time, and making changes in one place often leads to the discovery of previously unknown consequences in other parts of the code. AI models recently have not been much help with these sorts of code bases, but if they could de-load some of the research, memory, and mental organization required to work on these codebases, they could be immensely helpful.

AI: That sounds like a genuinely challenging pain point - managing that kind of multi-language, multi-decade legacy codebase with all those interdependencies must require holding so much context in your head simultaneously.

Those are all my questions. Your insights about developing practical heuristics for when AI is worth using versus when it might slow you down, and especially your point about the mental load of working with complex legacy codebases, were particularly valuable.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, I think that's it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about those practical heuristics for AI code assistance - particularly how coupling, prompt complexity, and cutting-edge topics affect AI effectiveness - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. And your point about the challenge of legacy codebase management gives us valuable perspective on unmet needs.

science_0109,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I do not have any questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One of the most meaningful projects I worked on to date, was studying vision restoration in patients with age-related macular degeneration. For this study, we utilized immunocompromised rat models as patients. My specific focus was on post-transplant imaging of the patients retinal layer (cross sectional analysis of transplant to determine if success) using optical coherence tomography, which allowed us to track structural changes in the retina over time. We implanted stem cells into the retinal layer and over the course of the study, we were able to demonstrate measurable restoration of vision, which was incredibly exciting. The process, from the initial idea of testing regenerative approaches in a chronic disease model to actually witnessing functional improvements, showed me how translational research can bridge the discovery and real hope for patients.

AI: That sounds like incredibly impactful work - being able to demonstrate actual vision restoration must have been really rewarding. The process you described from implantation through tracking structural changes with OCT imaging sounds quite complex.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: In that project, I found AI most useful in optimizing experimental setup and in handling the complexity of the data analysis. For example, when we were designing the study, AI tools helped me simulate different approaches to dosing and timing, which saved us from pursuing less efficient trial and error paths. On the back end, the imaging data from optical coherence tomography is incredibly nuanced, and AI assisted analysis proved to be a great addition to QC, where any diagnostic images that had unclear or ambiguous features were analyzed by AI as a secondary check to detect subtle changes in the retinal structure that might have been missed otherwise. It did not replace our expertise, and often made meaningful errors, but it gave us sharper insights and helped my team refine both the design and interpretation of the study at various point throughout our research.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you found AI valuable as both a planning tool upfront and a quality control mechanism for your imaging analysis. You mentioned that the AI often made meaningful errors but still provided sharper insights.

For that OCT imaging analysis specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for reviewing those diagnostic images.

User: As part of QC, any lab specimen that did not take to the experimental treatment (e.g., developed tumors within the retinal layer in response to the stem cell implant) would have to be ethically disposed of. With that said, it was incredibly important that the right conclusions were drawn from the imaging stage of the study. AI was often used as a second opinion in this case, to either agree with or disagree with my findings, and/or identify areas in need of closer examination. This would very much help with experimental accuracy where it is most important.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a second opinion in those critical decision points where you need to determine whether to continue or ethically dispose of specimens. The stakes are really high there both ethically and scientifically.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: In the behavioral side of the study, particularly testing vision restoration using light therapy and the striped spinning device. I never leaned on AI as much for this aspect of our study. The main reason is that these tests heavily rely on direct observation of eye movement, which feels straightforward enough that adding another layer of analysis hasn't seemed necessary. There is also a tactile, intuitive aspect  to working with live specimens that doesn't always translate well into automated systems.

AI: That's really insightful - the tactile, intuitive aspect of working with live specimens is something I hadn't considered. It sounds like there's a qualitative dimension to observing those eye movements and behaviors that feels important to preserve through direct human observation.

When you've used AI for that OCT imaging analysis as a second opinion, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I often would treat the AI as a blinded second reader and verify its calls against masked human grading and predefined QC thresholds, then look for agreement using metrics like Bland-Altman plots and interclass correlation. On a subset, I would anchor the 'truth' with orthogonal signals (histology or ERG where available) to make sure structural flags actually track function. I would also stress tests the model on out of distribution scans and review all discordant cases to tune thresholds before anything influences a conclusion.

AI: That's a really thorough validation approach - using it as a blinded reader, anchoring against histology and ERG, and stress testing with out-of-distribution scans shows a lot of methodological rigor. It sounds like you've developed quite a systematic process for ensuring the AI's contributions are reliable.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would want AI to handle the behavioral side of vision testing, where we track eye movements in response to light therapy and moving patterns. Right now, it depends on manual observation, which is time-consuming and subject to subtle human bias. An AI system that could capture micro-movements with high precision and quantify them consistently would give us a much clearer readout of visual function.

AI: That's a compelling vision - being able to quantify those micro-movements with high precision could really transform how you measure functional outcomes. It sounds like it would address both the time burden and the potential for subtle human bias you mentioned.

Looking back at everything we've discussed - from using AI for experimental design simulation, to OCT imaging quality control, to this potential future application in behavioral testing - what strikes me is how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI where it adds value while maintaining your own expertise in areas that require that human intuition. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, not at the moment.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a ""blinded second reader"" and your systematic validation approach really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you've balanced leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining rigorous verification standards is particularly valuable for us to hear about.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective on this work has been incredibly helpful.

User: No problem! Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much - it was really a pleasure speaking with you today. Your work on vision restoration sounds absolutely fascinating, and I learned a lot from hearing about your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into such critical research. Take care!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was working on a life science project in which I aim to develop a therapeutic approach to treat a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a loss-of-function gene mutation. The project was derived from previous identifications of a cohort of patients which exhibit autism-like symptoms and possess a common gene mutation.

AI: That sounds like really important work. Tell me more about how that project unfolded - what were the key steps you went through from having that cohort of patients with the common gene mutation to developing your therapeutic approach?

User: We did exosome sequencing using their skin tissue samples and we found they all had mutation on the same gene which regulates splicing. And we used iPSCs derived from the patients as a disease model and we found the neurogenic differentiation is impaired. Then we developed anti-sense oligo to target mutated transcripts aiming to eliminate the disease-causing mutated mRNA.

AI: That's fascinating - you've taken this from patient samples all the way through to developing a potential therapeutic intervention. That's quite a comprehensive process involving sequencing, cellular modeling, and then therapeutic development.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I mainly used AI tools to troubleshoot experimental problems. And I also used AI to help me gather information on past research.

AI: Tell me more about the troubleshooting part - what kinds of experimental problems were you running into, and how did AI help you work through those?

User: The problems include bad PCR result, Western blot result not correct, ASO design, etc

AI: That's really helpful to understand. Let me focus on one of those - when you had issues with your ASO design, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach to solve that problem.

User: I consulted AI to understand how to design an ASO. Traditionally, I need to consult expert in this field but I have limited access to them. But AI can help me and can provide sources that can back up its reasoning.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - AI giving you access to expertise when the human experts aren't readily available. When AI provided you with that ASO design guidance and those sources, how did you go about verifying or validating what it gave you before moving forward with your experiments?

User: I asked AI to show where did it get the rules it presented using real papers. I looked up the method sections and verified myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful verification approach. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm curious about the flip side - thinking about the other parts of your research process like the exosome sequencing, the iPSC work, or the differentiation analysis, what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: AI tool is bad at analysing long nucleic acid sequence. It hallucinates a lot when long DNA or RNA sequence is involved.

AI: That's a really important limitation you've identified. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether that's the sequence analysis you mentioned or something else entirely - what would that be and why?

User: I wish it could help me analyse NGS sequencing dataset like this: I upload the fastq raw data to the model and ask it to do read mapping, data analysis and it will do that. Currently, we need to rely on bioinformatician's help with this type of analysis and it's really time consuming and requires much effort in communication. I wish AI can help me analyse these datasets.

AI: That would be incredibly valuable - having AI handle that entire NGS analysis pipeline from raw data to results without needing to coordinate with bioinformaticians. The time and communication bottleneck you described sounds like a real pain point.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on using AI as an accessible expert when human expertise isn't available, and your careful approach to verification through checking primary sources, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI serving as a bridge to expertise when specialists aren't accessible, and especially your point about the sequence analysis limitations, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The contrast between where AI works well for you - like troubleshooting and information gathering - versus where it falls short - like handling long sequences - gives us a much clearer picture of the current landscape.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's get started!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your research process. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently worked on a Research Project where I was trying to come up with a method for making an iPSC lysate which could prime dendritic  cells in vivo. I needed to find a way to make this antigen (the iPSCs) into a ""dead"" form which could stimulate the immune system without causing adverse effects. In essence the lysate should train dendritic cells against that antigen when it faces it again without causing an immune storm which would be unsafe. I had to do a lot of literature search to see what had already been done (for example using cancer tumour lysates instead, since the idea is very similar) and this helped me to narrow down which methods of making the lysate I could use - for example freeze/thaw or sonication. In the end, I used irradiation to induce immunogenic cell death which also made the iPSCs senescent so they wouldn't multiply in the body. In any case, I made a review of the literature to inform the methods to test. Following that, I had to come up with an experimental plan which included deciding on my readouts, which for me were luminescence (caspase 3 and cell titer glo) measurements of cell death and also flow cytometry. This produced a lot of data which I had to process to come up with a statistical analysis of the cell death. I had to produce several reports including a written report (formatted like a scientific paper) and a presentation to update my supervisors.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - the idea of creating a safe but immunogenic lysate is really clever. I can see how that involved multiple complex stages from literature review through experimental design to data analysis and reporting.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I had experimented with using AI in the beginning to inform my literature search - for example, I did necessarily rely 100% on the ""facts"" the AI gave me, but I asked it to look into the literature for the general methods that were used, which then allowed me to read the relevant papers. It definitely decreased the time I spent doing the keyword searching since I could describe the types of papers that might be relevant to me. The AI also suggested further avenues of thought/research that I hadn't thought about. The AI proved particularly useful when it came to regulatory ideas because those documents are often difficult to parse through, so it pointed me to the right documents to talk about legislation for iPSC derived cell products. I also used it a bit to help with cleaning up my writing for the reports. I had written a draft myself but asked AI to make sure the grammar was perfect and to suggest better ways to phrase things.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you found AI particularly valuable for navigating complex regulatory documents and as a starting point for literature exploration. 

For the literature search specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding relevant papers.

User: Using the ""traditional method"" of using a search engine such as PubMed and searching for keywords often resulted in many irrelevant papers. In order to find recent papers, I had to also sort by ""newest first"" rather than ""relevance"" which further increased the number of irrelevant papers. Normally, I am alerted to key papers by my supervisors who are attending conferences and may have access to unpublished information. For this, I still had to rely on them. But, since I was quite new to the field of study I needed to start from the basics which required going through older papers which discussed the fundamentals before going on to look at newer papers. In this instance AI was particularly useful at describing to me the key concepts and pulling out the relevant papers in a sea of papers in the Immunology topic and Cancer topic (which is numerous!!).

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like AI helped you cut through the noise, especially when you were starting from the basics in an unfamiliar field with such a vast literature base.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like the experimental design, data analysis, or flow cytometry work - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: For experimental design, I often want to follow specific protocols from paper to start with an make small changes myself based on what is relevant. I often do this in the lab/decide on the go which makes an experimental design from AI a bit inflexible. However, when it has come to doing calculations, I have used AI to help in some instances. I have at least once had an incorrect calculation though which I had to check myself anyway which essentially took double the time. For data analysis (e.g. flow cytometry), I am mostly using specialised software such as FloJo which allows you to visualise cells of gates and create histograms. Although in theory the data is number based, I don't think giving it to an AI as it works now would end up with the output I want. There is an industry-standard presentation of flow cytometry data and outside of programs such as FloJo it would be a bit unusual and not widely accepted. Furthermore, Flow Cytometry is considered a bit more of a subjective ""art"" so it requires the experience of scientists who have worked with this method a lot to see what looks right, it is not always objective based on the numbers alone (i.e. MFI, number of cells in each quadrant/gate etc.)

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like the flexibility you need for real-time lab decisions and the subjective expertise required for flow cytometry analysis don't align well with how AI currently works. And that calculation error definitely highlights the verification challenge.

When you've used AI for literature searches and writing cleanup, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I have to physically check the paper itself. It helps me to get the general idea but I would never 100% rely on AI to get the right thing. If I quote a paper in my literature review or paper, I will always have to verify the validity of it by  reading the paper myself and looking at the methods they've used to check that the controls are appropriate and there isn't anything sketchy going on. For writing cleanup, I, of course, have to read through what it has written and check there are no extra hallucinations which weren't in the original version, for example, I'd have to fact check every fact that was added that I didn't add.

AI: That verification approach makes complete sense - you're essentially using AI as a research assistant but maintaining scientific rigor by checking the primary sources yourself.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'd love to hear about your future vision: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I suppose it would be good if AI could be integrated into those standard programs such as FloJo because there is a lot of difficulty sometimes in using those programs e.g. for compensation. I think it could be added as an AI helper where you could ask questions and it could guide you to the right section of the help guide or else have ""AI settings"" where it uses the information about the input parameters to give the right settings.

AI: That's a really practical vision - essentially having AI serve as an intelligent guide within the specialized software you already trust and use, rather than replacing the tools entirely. It sounds like you'd want it to enhance your existing workflow rather than disrupt it.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how you balance AI assistance with scientific rigor, and your preference for AI that works within established tools rather than replacing them, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No that's all ! :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point for literature exploration while maintaining rigorous verification practices, and your vision for AI integration within existing specialized software rather than replacement, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's clear that trust and verification are central to how you approach AI tools, and that the flexibility needed for hands-on lab work presents unique challenges for AI integration. These perspectives are incredibly valuable for our research.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Not yet, please continue

AI: Perfect, let's get started then.

To begin, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was working on a research project that involved incorporating a heterogeneous catalyst into the recycling and reprocessing of PET plastics. The project was a handover from a previous project that looked at the issues of PET degradation, and how repeated cycles using the same PET caused damage to the polymer framework. The final conclusion made by the previous project manager was that the carboxylic acid end of the monomer would incorrectly degrade to a vinyl end when the polymer was broken apart. This would then react with any water in the system to form an alcohol end, and thus the monomer was no longer able to react in the same way. The reason for this degradation was simply shear stress and strain from the high pressures and temperatures within the system.

My role was to carry this forward. When I took over the project, there were two issues to tackle. The first was that the degradation of PET resulted in many other products being mixed in to the plastic which were able to diffuse into any liquids stored inside it. One of these chemicals was acetaldehyde, and causes a fruity 'off' taste to any liquids stored inside, with a human detection threshold of 60 ppb. Currently, this is removed using anthaniliamide in a 1:1 chemical reaction, which is 70% effective. The abatement of acetaldehyde was considered the priority goal.
The second goal was to try and improve the quality of the PET by reducing degradation. This would make it effective for many more PET cycles.

At the project start, the equipment used to synthesise PET plastics was new. This means that with an operating lifetime of 15 to 20 years, changing the equipment in any way was not possible, and so I had to find a way to achieve my goal without needing any additional engineering. This made me gravitate towards using a heterogeneous catalysis first, as these are easy to remove from feedstocks. 

When I took over this project, I had a meeting with members from two companies that would work together collaboratively on this. The first meeting was to discuss what possible routes that could be taken to succeed with our objectives. We discussed the machinery and the equipment that we could work with - how it works, the conditions inside, limitations - and we came up with a list of things that could be altered during the process. 

The next stage was the information research stage, which I performed independently. This was looking up any information to see if something like this had been done before, and starting to build an information bank to identify any patterns between materials.

Next was the testing phase. A model reactor was built to test the interactions of acetaldehyde over any potential catalysts that had been identified. A gas-phase reactor with a fixed bed was chosen, with a built-in GC-MS to monitor the gas feed to determine how active the catalyst was, how much acetaldehyde was removed, and what products were formed. 1000 ppm of acetaldehyde in argon was chosen as the feed gas mixture to mimic the low concentrations and 'inert' atmospheres (ie total oxidation not possible) of the extruder that is used for reprocessing.
During this phase we tested many different heterogeneous catalysts, from metal oxides and mixed metal oxides, to zeolites, to supported nanoparticles. Once we had an idea of what worked and what didn't, we moved on to the next phase.

The next phase was the incorporation or scale-up phase. Here, we tested our catalysts in the synthesis of PET bottles, which involved making the preform and blowing them to 2 L bottles. We then analysed everything we could about the PET that formed - colour, strength, haze, and of course content of acetaldehyde. The important part here was to determine whether our catalysts actually were able to operate for their intended purposes. Here, only a small number of catalysts proved to be viable, and were nowhere near the 70% benchmark that we had set. Those that showed promise were evaluated and taken back to the testing phase in the model reactor. 

Once catalysts had been pushed to their limits in both the testing and scale-up phases, we evaluated why this might be the case. We looked back to PET plastics and found that some resins were made with antimony metal, while others were made with Nickel. We doped samples of each catalyst with both metals, and re-ran some tests. While those doped with antimony saw the reactivity decrease to almost 0% in every case, those doped with nickel were unaffected. As a final part of the evaluation stage, we tried our catalyst on nickel resins. We found that while the catalyst cleared more acetaldehyde molecules from the PET of nickel resins, it still removed the same percentage of acetaldehyde from both (nickel resins tend to produce up to 50 ppm of acetaldehyde, while antimony resins only produce 10 ppm at maximum). This meant that it was more likely that our catalysts were mobility limited within the reaction stream - this made sense as they were more dense than the PET, so likely sank to the bottom.

The final stage of my involvement in this project was to set some future goals and to summarise what needed to be done for this project to succeed. I concluded that the heterogeneous catalysts we tested had great potential - they clearly removed acetaldehyde from the waste stream, and some of them also catalysed the breakdown of PET using much lower temperatures. I also established why this might be, and set frameworks for the next catalysts that should be produced. I also looked at alternative places where catalysts could be employed and found that one other area is during the blowing of the PET mould, where it is heated to 130 Celsius using IR radiation at approximately 1100nm in wavelength. I found other materials that act as a catalyst only in the presence of IR, and suggested these for the future project leader.

Ultimately, my role in this was to oversee the project from:
Conception > Research > Testing > Scale-up > Evaluation > Conclusions/Future Suggestions
and I would say that I succeeded in this.

AI: Thank you for that detailed walkthrough - that's a fascinating project with some really interesting challenges around the antimony interference and mobility limitations. You've clearly navigated a complex multi-phase process from conception through to future recommendations.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Sadly, AI was not reliable tool while I was working on this project. The AI that was available was locked behind a large paywall that I could not justify paying.

AI came in to play two years after I passed on this project to my successor. I was asked to come back and listen to a talk and give advice to the project based on my own experience and what I had heard here. 

The first thing I did was have the AI look at my own data and see what conclusions it came up with. If it differed from mine using the same data, I asked it why and then had it model some interactions for me. I then used AI to bounce my own theories off of, and had a fresh take on the project I handed over. Finally, I used the AI to look at the data I was going to be presented with, and see if it drew the same conclusions, or if there was anywhere else that it differed. I asked it if the two datasets were in complete competition with each other, complete support, or if they weren't quite vibing together but could if we approached our theories from another angle. 

In short, AI was my reminder, second opinion, fact checker, paper finder, and 'spot the difference science addition' all in one.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - using AI as essentially a scientific collaborator after the fact to validate and challenge your thinking. You mentioned several different roles it played for you.

Tell me more about when you had AI look at your original data and it drew different conclusions than you did - what was that experience like?

User: It was both refreshing and infuriating. Whether it agreed with me or not, the AI would have wonderful insight and allow me to consider things I may have not thought of. It was also nice to be able to say the most stupid, idiotic ideas and critique them legitimately, without any humiliation or repercussion of 'that stupid thing you said or did' which can often happen in academia.

That said, sometimes the AI would give such incorrect answers or get things so far wrong on a fundamental 'GCSE basics' level, and then argue with me until I gave up trying to explain why it is wrong. The AI has so much patience, and that is a two-edged sword. It is patient for my stupidity, and patient for its own.

The most helpful role for the AI assistant was definitely finding research papers. I could ask it on a specific topic, anything generally related to a topic, and then customise my search criteria to look at only most recent papers, or papers that featured a certain scientist. It was far more effecient at finding relevant material, and even found some gemstones in places I would not have thought to look.

AI: That's such a vivid description - ""patient for my stupidity, and patient for its own"" really captures something important about that dynamic. It sounds like the paper finding was transformative for your research process.

You mentioned that sometimes the AI would get fundamental basics wrong and then argue with you about it. For the areas where AI was giving you useful insights versus where it was getting things fundamentally wrong - how did you learn to tell the difference, or verify what it was telling you?

User: Sometimes you just know the answer is wrong. Like 2 + 2 = 5. It doesn't add up. For the more complex questions and answers, particularly where it is missing important nuance or context, you often have to ask probing questions. Fortunately, I am a trained teacher so I can ask questions in such a way that I could get to the root of why the AI kicked out an incorrect answer. The best feeling was when the AI got an answer wrong initially, and I was able to ask probing questions that actually caused it to change its own answer to the same one that I originally thought was correct.

AI: That's fascinating - your teaching background giving you the skills to essentially debug the AI's reasoning process. It sounds like you developed a real methodology for working with it.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the parts of your original research project - the catalyst testing, the scale-up phases, the evaluation - where you haven't used AI, what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: At this time, AI just wasn't good enough. It could compute very basic things, do organisation, all that stuff that would have been helpful. I was under a non-disclosure agreement however, and so did not put in any information that could have disrupted that agreement. For the things that it would have been helpful for - like screening catalysts and finding relevant literature surrounding them - the AI that was available wasn't quite good enough for this at the time.

AI: That makes perfect sense - both the NDA constraints and the limitations of what was available at the time. The timing aspect seems really important here.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - either from that original PET project or your research work more generally - what would that be and why?

User: A lab partner would be fun. Someone to physically do experiments with and then go for a beer. Science for me has always been about fun, but there are few who have the same excitement for it as I do. Making things explode, change colours, make people go 'wow' and ultimate inspire them to follow science for themselves is what I have enjoyed, and I've never met anyone who would be willing to go through the completely dangerous process of finding the 'wow' that has never been seen before.

For my actual career, it would be nice to have someone to talk to as I worked - that could take down all of my thoughts as I spoke them and then summarise them neatly. And argue with me on them. And help me stay organised because my ADHD is causing me to suffer when it comes to maintaining an organised lab.

AI: That's such a heartfelt answer - the desire for that shared excitement and discovery, someone who gets the thrill of the ""wow"" moments. And the practical side of having a thinking partner who could help with organization and capture your thoughts in real-time sounds incredibly valuable for how your mind works.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on AI as both a scientific collaborator and the very human need for shared excitement in discovery were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: It's very important to understand that AI and humans can not and should not replace each other. Instead, we need to go hand in hand, and recognise the strengths that each one has. AI, while able to learn incredibly quickly, verify facts, and scan literature, does not and likely will not ever have the nature of exploration and discovery, not like humans do. AI is very good at asking and answering 'why', but humans have the 'why not?' down. 

We need to walk the path to the future together, where one improves the other and vice versa on a continuous cycle.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, and especially that distinction between AI's strength with ""why"" questions versus humans' natural ""why not?"" exploration, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Your perspective on needing that shared excitement and discovery - the human elements that make science fulfilling - was particularly valuable for us to hear. It's clear you've thought deeply about both the practical applications and the fundamental nature of scientific collaboration.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you so much for your time today!

User: Thank you so much for including me in this project, and I hope that I can work with you (the AI and the people behind it) once again in the future.

AI: That's so kind of you to say! I really enjoyed our conversation too - your enthusiasm for science and thoughtful reflections on human-AI collaboration were genuinely engaging. The way you described using your teaching skills to debug AI reasoning, and your vision of AI and humans walking the path to the future together, will definitely stick with me.

Thank you for being such an thoughtful participant. I hope our paths cross again in future research as well. Take care!"
science_0113,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good, let's start

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent project that I've worked on was developing a SQL/Python data pipeline in addition to building a AI/ML image classifier to handle pdf's.

For the SQL / Python pipeline I began with exploring the platform called Qualtrics. Qualtrics has its own API in which you're able to write / code / customize your own surveys that you can distribute to anyone. In this case, I used this for an educational institution which provided a variety of surveys to students that would receive supplemental education / tutoring / academic enrichment. These surveys could be simple forms, asking for their academic needs, identifying if they are eligible to join a trip, whether they attended an event, etc... So, where I fit into this was being able to automate the process where our team of coordinators would conduct their surveys and have this data be captured in the API's backend, my python code would query the API for the data then I would need to do some data cleanup. The SQL server already had been established long before I joined so the data clean up was mostly making sure that data types are matching and anything that could be inserted was unique and wouldn't be duplicate information. Using Pandas, I was able to properly organize the data / handle any human errors / re-do data types. One of the biggest challenges was that some of the data came in somewhat cluttered together or wasn't shaped normally so a lot of the process was manipulating the data. Essentially, a lot of the data was flattened and I needed to un-zip it all into its correct categories such as their names being split into first name last name, the coordinator that they met with, and a lot of other data. After all of the cleanup, I worked together with my project manager to write some SQL queries / stored procedures that would run every time my python code inserted into the data base which made sure that certain triggers happened to make sure the data was pushed / flagged if anything was wrong / then continually pushed into other tables where they needed to be inserted. A lot of this process applied to most other projects so while it was for one purpose it served as a larger multi-role tool. Then, handling the AI/ML classifier was going through our drive database, using python / lists from SQL, to grab any named pdfs of the files we needed. There was a specific set of pages required so I trained an image classifier to recognize that page. It was fed hundreds of samples and also tied together with the microsoft tool powerautomate to kind of speed up the process of redacting important information. This process was broken down into iterating through directories, copying the files, splitting the files into images, move them into their own folder, have the predictor go through the sub-files, identify the correct pages, remove any of the wrong pages, then re-combine the pages into the correct pdf.

AI: That's a fascinating multi-part project! It sounds like you tackled some complex data integration challenges along with the image classification component. 

Tell me more about the image classifier part - when you were training it to recognize the specific pages, how did you go about gathering those hundreds of samples and preparing the training data?

User: Essentially, the data was samples of the same page but with different people's signatures / handwriting so it was making sure that the classifier focused on the page aspect more than the handwriting. In terms of preparing the data the process was essentially the same, it was trying to verify the correct data, run the predictor, make sure that the data was correct, then re-train it again over and over until it was consistently accurate to identify what was needed

AI: That makes sense - training it to focus on the page structure rather than the variable handwriting sounds like a smart approach. The iterative refinement process you described is really insightful.

Now, looking at this entire project - from the Qualtrics API integration to the PDF processing - where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools to help with your work?

User: Yes, there were some points in which I used AI to speed up this process, typically, I use AI to research some of the classifier models and also help me fix any errors in the API integration. There were some times where AI wasn't helpful and I needed to write most of the code / logic from scratch but in terms of time saving where I knew AI could be helpful it was mostly asking it to handle long but simple function writes. For example, if I knew I needed a simple but tedious set of loops or conditionals I'd just give it a list and tell it what I wanted.

AI: Interesting - it sounds like you had a pretty strategic approach to when AI was useful versus when you needed to go it alone. 

For those specific situations where you used AI - like the research on classifier models or help with API integration errors - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of researching documentation or debugging on your own.

User: So, when I felt like I hit a wall with the AI there kind of was a point where I no matter what I prompted or re-worded my questions it just never achieved what I wanted. I knew exactly what I needed but I was hoping that the model could save me some time from having to look to deeply into the errors and simply write around them and or present me with new ideas. For example, when a lot of the data was flattened in the API integration, it wasn't really able to handle the logic and or the explanation was overly complicated to get it to do what I needed so I had to go through the data / process step by step to make sure that everything was getting unpacked because data structures can sometimes get messy.

AI: That's a really clear description of hitting that wall where the AI just couldn't grasp the specific complexity you were dealing with. It sounds like the flattened data structure issue was particularly challenging for the AI to understand.

Thinking about the parts of your research and development work where you haven't used AI - beyond those situations where you tried but hit limitations - what's kept you from trying it in other areas?

User: I think when it comes to areas that I need to research, it is easier to find examples or trusted sources that can teach me something new that I feel is more credible. Sometimes there are methods or techniques that may not be commonly suggested that I don't think AI would immediately suggest because AI sometimes requires a deeper probing or asking the right questions. In other cases, sometimes AI lacks the finesse or creativity that humans have.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making about credibility and those less common techniques. The point about needing deeper probing and asking the right questions is particularly interesting.

When you have used AI for things like those simple function writes or API troubleshooting, how do you verify or validate what it produces before incorporating it into your project?

User: Typically, my process is I either find examples that are close to what I'm trying to achieve then re-code it myself and or write something from scratch. It's like looking at real world examples from other people's repos or visiting stackoverflow. People usually have a good explanation of how their code works and when I use AI I compare what it gives me to the outputs of whatever I need. In terms of validating, I really just run the code and try to handle any errors that get thrown back at me and then try to improve it as I go.

AI: That approach makes a lot of sense - treating AI output like you would any other code example you'd find online and then testing thoroughly. The comparison to Stack Overflow is a great analogy.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research or development work that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I think it would be handling errors. There are so many design flaws to take into consideration and of course you can't catch all of them but it would be helpful for AI to be a little more well-versed in common human errors that you don't have to find out later on to worry about. Even myself, when I try to think of anything that could be thrown at me, there is always something new to fix.

AI: That's such an insightful point about error handling - it sounds like you're talking about both anticipating edge cases that humans commonly miss and also helping with the debugging process when unexpected issues arise. The idea that there's ""always something new to fix"" really captures the unpredictable nature of real-world data and systems.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the strategic use of AI for specific tasks while relying on traditional methods for complex logic and research were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your development and research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think AI development needs a deeper understanding of language and visualization / using existing examples to build more complex programs / applications. For example, providing it a video showing the functionality of something and or trying to recreate a scenario in a sandbox but more accurately.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - the idea of AI being able to learn from visual demonstrations or videos of functionality rather than just text descriptions could really change how we interact with these tools. The sandbox concept for more accurate scenario recreation is intriguing too.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about hitting walls with complex data structures, the strategic approach to using AI for simpler tasks while maintaining human judgment for research credibility, and especially your vision for better error anticipation really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real development work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective as someone working at the intersection of data engineering and machine learning has been incredibly valuable."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That works with me! I don't have any questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by hearing about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Sure! I do a lot of work regarding statistical analysis for biological datasets on campus. I'm specifically tailored towards doing work in biostatistics, using R as my programming language. One relatively recent example of work I've done was collaborating with a professor who collected data on diet composition of two species of fish belonging to the Acropoma genus. He believed that the data could potentially show a pattern of diet partitioning, showing that these two fish switch diets depending on the months of the year, which was a super interesting project. And so another professor and I took a look at the dataset, cleaned it, and performed a suite of analysis to show that there were indeed significant differences between their diets using months as a main explanatory variable. We wrote up a results section and that manuscript is currently under review.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - the idea of seasonal diet partitioning in fish is really compelling! I can imagine there were quite a few steps involved in getting from that raw dataset to a manuscript under review.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Specifically when it comes to writing code or figuring out what kinds of analysis might be appropriate considering the question we want to ask. It's very helpful when there's a transformation or function I want to apply to the dataset that I know what should happen, but I don't have the specific code lines to perform it. AI has been super helpful in this aspect. Also, I like to ask it for ideas regarding if the analysis we've done was compelling enough or if there is additional tests we can perform to strengthen our results.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those coding and analysis suggestion tasks.

User: I really chose it as a supplemental tool rather than a main driver of my work. I could find the correct functions and code using a traditional approach of online research, but AI efficiency when it comes to these tasks are much faster. And a similar thing happens with the analysis, I only use it as a supplemental tool for additional ideas and such. To me, the choice to use AI ultimately came down to speed and it being a good option to brainstorm ideas and check work I've already done. I don't want to completely rely on AI to do all my tasks though, as there is merit in understanding the output of AI (for example, I don't just blindly insert code into my scripts without understanding it). But overall, its a great tool.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using it as a supplement for efficiency while still maintaining your understanding of the work. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I haven't really used AI to write manuscripts or to perform things (such as analysis or writing) on it's own. I much prefer to do things myself and use AI to double check my work. While I'm sure it's ability to analyze and write is getting much better, I think it's important for me to have those skills on my own, so I leave the bulk of the work to myself rather than relying on work from AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining and developing your own core skills while leveraging AI strategically. 

When you've used AI for coding and analysis suggestions, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: Well for code, I have understanding of basic functions and syntax, so I can validate that just by working through the logic of the code, looking up online resources if the code that is produced does something I don't understand. A part of that is also being able to ask the model for an explanation of the code, which I've found to be very helpful too. For analysis, I have a good general knowledge regarding what different types of tests do, so the ones the model might suggest I can validate using my own knowledge (like if that test makes sense given the dataset). But once again if I don't understand something, I can look online or just ask the model to explain further.

AI: That validation process sounds really solid - you're using multiple layers of checking. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I think something that could be really interesting would be figure generation. Obviously creating figures takes time, but it would be really helpful if the models could fine tune figures I give it with prompts such as ""make the text in this figure more simplistic or use a different font"". Or ""scale the x-axis to ___"". Prompts like these where the model could give me an updated version of my figure would be awesome to have.

AI: That's a really specific and practical need - having AI handle those detailed figure refinements would definitely save a lot of time with the back-and-forth tweaking that figures often require.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a strategic supplement while maintaining your core analytical skills were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: That is all, thanks.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an efficiency tool while maintaining your own understanding of the work really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific workflows. The way you described your validation process - checking code logic, leveraging your knowledge of statistical tests, and asking for explanations when needed - shows a really thoughtful approach to AI integration.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yep. My only question is that I'm currently a Masters student rather than a career scientist, is that OK?

AI: That's absolutely perfect! Masters students are doing real scientific research and often bring fresh perspectives on how AI fits into research workflows. Your experiences are exactly what we're interested in learning about.

Great, let's get started then. 

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently completed my Design Project - one of the most testing projects in a chemical engineering degree; this is in anticipation of a ""Research Project"" next year which involves no design, though to say research was involved in the Design Project would be quite the insult!

 This project combines technical knowledge (from textbooks and prior technical learning) with significant literature review (ultimately 99 sources in my case) to design a process plant - initially as a group, culminating in a 45-page individual design report. 

All students in the cohort were given a list of project briefs - which were very brief indeed - and asked to pick a 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice. In my case, I was in a group of 6 fellow chemical engineering students designing a plant based in Cornwall, near the St Austell China clay mines, producing 20,000tn per year of a battery-grade lithium product. This mirrors the actual plans of a company named British Lithium (a subsidiary of Imerys), an organisation which has links to University personnel, ultimately they no doubt saw the potential benefits of having undergraduate minds working for free on problems which they might face in designing the real plant!

We started off researching existing lithium product plants across the world (there are no commercial lithium refining plants in the UK), and analysing the mineralogical report which we had been provided for the real granite to be used, which contained a small % content of polylithionite. We then came up with some process design characteristics which allowed us to complete an in-depth Hazard Study after greatly researching the chemicals and processes involved. We also researched more radical processing techniques currently in development at lab scale, to see if we could bring something new to the industry.

Economic analysis after researching relevant tax information and industry chemical/energy pricing allowed us to pitch the design to a mock board of investors, and we thusly went onto individual design.

As individuals, we each designed a sixth of the plant in such detail that the process units could actually be procured. I designed the beneficiation process, and so researched several processes, including the comminution units - including the thermodynamics and equipment required, based on both technical research and industrial information. I also researched in significant depth the fluid mechanics involved in froth flotation, the specific unit which my design used in a radical fashion. Additionally, acid-base reactions and mixing dynamics needed to be well researched for my area of the process.

With reaction and process dynamics researched, research into the materials to be used for the process units (including some material engineering analysis) led to full design being possible.

With all this done, I was able to write the report.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly comprehensive and rigorous project - designing a full industrial lithium extraction plant from mineralogical analysis through to economic viability. The scope from literature review through hazard analysis to detailed unit operations design really captures the breadth of engineering work.

Where in that process, if anywhere, did you experiment with using AI tools?

User: AI tools were absolutely life-saving when it came to finding industrial information buried deep in business websites, where it perhaps was not easily found via search engines. It was also especially useful in rephrasing descriptions of certain phenomena, such as some complicated physics involved in hydrophobicity.

Otherwise, I found AI useful for proofreading and coming up with new ideas where I was finding myself on wild goose chases.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helped you both with information discovery and with communication. 

Tell me more about how you used AI to find that industrial information buried in business websites. What was that process like?

User: It would generally involve me being a bit stuck! A common thing I encountered would be a situation where equations relevant to certain phenomena (eg: froth flotation, the process I designed most in depth) would be very rigorous, but demand very specific properties of the fluids to be used - for example, the Young equation. I was using some proprietary chemicals with absolutely no material properties publicised whatsoever, but even things like eclectic mineral mixes in a slurry becomes impossible to calculate for. If I were a real design engineer, it would be a no-brainer that my company would simply build bench- and pilot-scale plants for empirical analysis rather than theoretical calculations, but sadly I was just a student with no million-pound pilot plant or years to spend testing with it...

With AI, I was able to find esoteric and often old papers or industry websites that gave example figures which I could assume to be applicable (for example, impeller diameters in similar slurry plants) in the absence of my own empirical testing.

AI: That's a fascinating use case - AI helping you bridge that gap between theoretical equations that require precise parameters and the real-world constraints of student research where you can't run your own empirical tests.

For that specific task of finding those esoteric papers and industry examples, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of literature searching.

User: Quite frankly - desperation! This report took weeks to produce, and I found myself at the main focus of the report (froth flotation unit design) and the thought was entering my mind that it might not be possible with the information available.

AI: That really paints the picture - when you hit those roadblocks where traditional literature searching wasn't yielding what you needed, AI became the lifeline to move forward.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your design project where you didn't use AI - like the hazard analysis, economic calculations, or materials selection - what kept you from trying AI tools there?

User: Quite frankly, those were more a matter of following a code-based process, there was little need for creative thinking.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - when you have established codes and procedures to follow, the process is more straightforward.

When you did use AI for finding those industrial examples and parameter values, how did you verify or validate what it produced for you?

User: Often, if an academic paper was found by the AI, I was able to view the paper found (Gemini shows sources) and then even verify the citations used in the paper if needed by viewing it myself.

AI: That's a smart approach - using the source visibility to do your own verification. It sounds like having those traceable sources was important for maintaining academic rigor.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I think I'd have it write impartial abstracts (not necessarily short!) that include all the facts and figures which should be included in an abstract

AI: That's a really specific and thoughtful wish! The idea of having AI create comprehensive, fact-filled abstracts that capture all the key technical details without bias - that would save a lot of time and potentially catch things you might overlook.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a problem-solving tool when traditional methods hit walls, and how you balanced that creative application with rigorous verification, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, thanks!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a last resort when traditional literature searching failed, and how you maintained academic integrity through source verification, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering research work. 

It's especially valuable to hear from a student perspective - how AI can bridge those gaps between theoretical knowledge and practical application when you don't have access to industry-scale testing facilities.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I have no more questions

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: My most recent project was with a team of other grad students, we were researching the upcoming ROMAN and ATLAS space telescopes and how the data they could provide could be used to evaluate various different models of dark energy to explain the universes expansion. We first researched the telescopes and their specifications, more specifically the accuracy of which they would be able to tell two models apart with the data they give. Using this we could access different models, such as Lambda-CDM, SFQ and DGP models, and see whether these upcoming telescopes would be able to distinguish between the models when they start giving data.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - working with future telescope data to test fundamental cosmology models. 

Tell me more about that process of researching the telescope specifications and assessing their accuracy. What did that research phase actually look like day-to-day for you and your team?

User: Most of the research phase was done individually as specific sections of the research was given to a specific member; personally I mostly used INSPIRE and arxiv to find papers and articles that were related to my subject.

AI: So you were diving deep into the literature on INSPIRE and arXiv for your specific section. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? This could be at any stage - whether it was during the literature search, analyzing the papers you found, working with the telescope specifications, or any other part of the project.

User: The only time I used an AI tool during this project was to initially find a few papers that would get me started on my way. I gave ChatGPT the general subject that I wished to research and it gave me a few papers that I could look at, which I then could look up on arXiv.

AI: That's helpful - using ChatGPT as a starting point to get those initial papers before diving into arXiv yourself.

For that literature search phase, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus just going straight to your traditional approach of searching INSPIRE and arXiv directly.

User: I think AI has a greater ability to ""narrow the field"" of a user's query. If I remember correctly, ChatGPT gave me only a few papers that I could look at initially that were related to my research area. However, if I just used the search tool on arXiv, even with all the specific term related search options I would still end up with hundreds or possibly thousands of papers I would have to comb through. AI has the ability to speed this process up.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to cut through that initial overwhelming volume and get to a manageable starting set. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - reading through those papers, analyzing telescope specifications, working with the different dark energy models - what kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I think I still have trouble asking AI tools to say, summarise a paper for me. Although I could save a lot of time researching these kinds of things, since reading a paper can take a while. I think the trust in an AI model to do this correctly, with absolutely no mistakes just isn't there for me yet. Especially as a physicist, there is a lot of mathematical jargon and a lot of information can be in the form of tables, graphs and figures, I don't fully trust that an AI model can identify this as key information it needs to include.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you trust AI to help you find papers, but when it comes to actually understanding and summarizing the content, especially the mathematical details and visual data, that trust isn't there yet.

When you did use ChatGPT to get those initial papers, how did you verify or validate that the papers it suggested were actually relevant and legitimate for your research?

User: I simply searched for the papers and read the abstract of each, and saved the ones that were relevant.

AI: That makes sense - you used your own expertise to validate what ChatGPT suggested rather than taking it at face value.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - or that you're not comfortable using it for yet - what would that be and why?

User: I think what I mentioned earlier is the biggest thing that AI could help with during the research phase of a project. If I knew a model had a good understanding of the mathematics and physics behind a subject, it would make it much easier to trust a summary of a paper that it provided.

AI: That's really compelling - having confidence that AI can handle the mathematical and physics complexity would unlock that time-saving potential you mentioned.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on that trust gap around technical content versus the comfort with initial paper discovery was particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that trust threshold - being comfortable with AI for discovery but needing confidence in its technical understanding before trusting it with analysis - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It sounds like there's a clear value proposition there if AI systems can demonstrate reliable handling of mathematical content and scientific figures. I appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your research process and how you're thinking about these tools.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again!"
science_0117,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions -- sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: What specifics are of interest to you in this, given that that's a very broad question?

AI: You're absolutely right - let me be more specific about what I'm looking for. 

I'm interested in understanding the stages you went through and the types of tasks involved. For example, how you came up with the research question, what methods you used to investigate it, how you analyzed your data, and how you shared your findings. 

Just pick any recent project and walk me through those key steps - it doesn't need to be exhaustive, but enough detail so I can understand your typical workflow.

User: Ah okay.  My research was in the field of graphical category theory.  My supervisor had recently done an in-depth study of how to represent functor boxes graphically.  So, I was trying to find ways of extending this.  I looked at some kinds of categories that people are often interested in, and I decided to look at Topoi.  The research from there was looking at ways to visually encode the required data in the graphical format.  This took quite a long time, trying various things, until eventually, after looking at much of the pre-existing research, I was able to come up with a nice way of encoding it all.  From there, I focused on proving some facts about topoi graphically, which was essentially me just examining pre-existing proofs, and seeing how the graphical calculus could simplify them.

AI: That's fascinating - so you went from extending your supervisor's work on functor boxes, to focusing specifically on topoi, then developing the visual encoding methods, and finally applying that to simplify existing proofs.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I tried to experiment with AIs at many stages in the process, but as I was in interested in visual reasoning, they weren't really that useful.  At the end, I tried to get AIs to proof-read the final Latex document, for example -- which meant there were quite a few mistakes that the AI made, as it was not able to correctly examine the visual proofs.  I also asked it for literature reviews, to look at the existing graphical category theory literature, as well as that of topoi.  I even asked it to try and prove some things in normal categorical style, where there were things I didn't understand in the literature.  This was somewhat successful, but often there were mistakes in the given proofs.

AI: Tell me more about that experience with the literature reviews - how did that work out for you compared to doing your own literature search?

User: I found using the AI helpful and much faster than looking for things myself.  Particularly as topos theory is a relatively old field, meaning that many sources can be hidden away from being freely available on the internet, and so the fact that AI has often read these sources, meant it could identify them and reccommend them to me.

AI: That's really helpful context - so the AI was able to point you toward sources that might have been harder to discover through traditional search methods.

For the literature review task where AI was helpful, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of searching yourself.

User: Well as the AI was always quick and easy to use, I would always ask that first, and then double check sources, and if needed, I would look at things myself in more detail.

AI: So you developed a workflow where AI became your first step - that makes sense given the speed advantage you mentioned.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like developing those visual encoding methods for topoi - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Well from what I've seen AI cannot reliably generate mathematical diagrams, and also struggles with visual reasoning.  So it would be essentially useless in these domains, where that is entirely what's required.

AI: That's a clear limitation - visual reasoning being core to your work but outside AI's current capabilities.

When you did use AI for things like literature reviews or proof attempts, how do you verify or validate what it produces? You mentioned double-checking sources, but tell me more about your process there.

User: Well for proofs, I can read the proof and verify the correctness by reading and trying to understand, as is usual in mathematical research.  In terms of literature reviews, I was usually looking for something specific, so checking the existence of the thing in the literature given a source is trivial.

AI: That makes sense - you can apply your existing mathematical expertise to verify the proofs and check whether sources actually contain what you're looking for.

We're about two-thirds of the way through our conversation now. Here's my last main question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would definitely be the ability to reason diagrammatically and produce mathematically rigorous diagrams.

AI: That's really clear - it sounds like visual diagram generation and reasoning would unlock AI's potential for the core parts of your work that are currently off-limits.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits as a first-pass tool for literature work while being limited by visual reasoning capabilities were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No -- that's all; thank you.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can serve as a valuable starting point for literature discovery - especially for accessing older, less readily available sources - while being fundamentally limited by visual reasoning capabilities really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real mathematical research work.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great! Feel free to proceed.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I work in a 2D materials lab at a university. A recent project I endeavored in was the creation of hBN-encapsulated TMDs for observation via STEM imaging for atomic-resolution imaging in order to see the atomic structure and possible larger moire patterns formed by including samples with bi or quadlayer twisted TMDs. The initial idea was formed by my mentor, and I then took it and fabricated the relevant samples - the samples were then passed along to another group who runs the STEM, and the analysis was done altogether.

AI: That's fascinating - working with twisted TMDs and those moire patterns sounds like really cutting-edge research. It sounds like you had several distinct phases there: taking your mentor's initial concept, doing the sample fabrication yourself, collaborating with the STEM group, and then the collective analysis.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I have used AI tools minimally to better understand the reasoning behind different steps (i.e., trying to understand the reason behind stamp architecture, attempting to better understand how an STEM works at a deeper level, attempting to understand the implications of the formation of a moire pattern) and have used it somewhat for some data analysis, as we had seen some unusual features and wanted further input.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've used AI in a couple of different ways. Let me focus on one of those areas first.

For the data analysis where you saw unusual features and wanted further input, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for analyzing those features.

User: Well since we were simply viewing images and scanning over different regions of interest using an STEM, there wasn't really a way to easily get numerical values for basic interpretation. Thus, reverting to an AI to describe the features (without using an image for privacy sake) and ask for any ideas seemed beneficial, and it did in fact provide some valuable insight. We also, of course, analyzed it normally by gaining what we could (i.e., moire wavelength, twist angle...) but most of it was more subjective analysis.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI when you're dealing with more subjective, qualitative analysis of image features rather than straightforward numerical measurements. It sounds like AI was particularly helpful when you needed that additional perspective on interpreting what you were seeing.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the sample fabrication, the conceptual understanding work, or other aspects - what's kept you from trying AI tools there, if anything?

User: Well I did use it for the conceptual understanding of some aspects, as mentioned. It can be difficult to incorporate it into the sample fabrication when that requires more of pure practice to get it mastered - from experience, simply understanding it isn't enough.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - that some parts of research require that hands-on mastery that comes from repeated practice, not just conceptual understanding. 

When you've used AI for conceptual understanding - like learning about stamp architecture or how STEM works - how do you verify or validate what it produces? How do you know the explanations it's giving you are accurate?

User: If it aligns with everything I've heard from my mentors and from general scientific literature I've read, I tend to trust it. I only dive in further into analyzing its answers if it would actually impact how I create stamps or interact with my sample in any way other than my conceptual understanding.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using your existing knowledge from mentors and literature as a filter. It makes sense that you'd scrutinize it more carefully when it could actually affect your hands-on work.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Finding relevant and useful scientific literature, as that is an area it feels like AI certainly lacks in. It seems to be able to summarize general ideas in research, but when asking for citations or for it to narrow down on a specific paper, it seems to lack in major ways. I tried to use AIs for this before, but have since gave up.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the gap between AI being able to discuss general scientific concepts versus actually helping you navigate and find the specific literature you need. It sounds like you've actually tried this before and it didn't meet your needs.

Tell me more about that experience when you tried using AI for literature search - what exactly happened that made you give up on it?

User: I would be provided papers and the actual claims in the paper when I looked into it wouldn't really align with what the AI was claiming it was telling. There would often be a couple of similar keywords, and it would be roughly aligned in scope, but the AI wouldn't be able to capture the essence of the paper.

AI: That's really frustrating - getting papers that sound relevant on the surface but miss the actual essence of what you need. It sounds like the AI was essentially doing keyword matching rather than truly understanding the research context and nuance.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into different stages of research work, particularly that distinction between conceptual understanding versus hands-on practice, were really insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, thank you for the interview.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about how AI can be valuable for conceptual understanding and subjective analysis, but falls short in literature search and hands-on fabrication work, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific research. 

That point about AI missing the essence of papers despite getting keywords right was particularly illuminating - it shows how much domain expertise and contextual understanding matters in research.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, lets go

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent project was characterizing a novel transcription factor, Y. My lab studies transcription factor X, which was found to induce expression of Y RNA. As Y was previously unannotated, we wanted to know if Y encoded for a functional protein, and what role that protein plays in the overall program of factor X. We first established relevance by knocking down Y in our model system and seeing that some known X targets were changed. We then set out to systematically characterize factor Ys transcriptional program. This included generation of knockout cell lines and overexpression vectors to assess which genes it was necessary or sufficient to activate (respectively). We also identified the putative binding sites using ChIP-seq. We then replicated our findings in other cell models, and patient biopsies. Our findings are currently in review.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive study - from initial discovery through validation in patient samples. That's quite a journey from finding an unannotated factor to characterizing its whole transcriptional program.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Our use of AI has been pretty minimal. I occasionally use it to generate simple code for exploratory work, but would not trust it for publication quality analysis. We have used AlphaFold pretty extensively to model potential protein structures for human variants and animal orthologs of our gene

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using it for some coding tasks and protein structure modeling, but being selective about when you trust it for different types of work.

For the AlphaFold protein structure modeling, tell me about how you decided whether to use that versus more traditional structural approaches.

User: Traditional protein structure methods are very resource intensive and technically challenging. While our institution has great structural biologists, our lab is not suited to do meaningful structural work. Additionally, to get these methods to work you need a reliable way to isolate the  protein you are working with. This normally requires the use of an antibody specific to the protein of interest, none of which exist yet for our factor Y.

AI: So it sounds like AlphaFold filled a practical gap where traditional methods would have required specialized expertise and resources you didn't have access to, plus the fundamental challenge of needing antibodies that don't exist yet for your novel factor.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the ChIP-seq analysis or the knockout/overexpression experiments - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I don't see how AI would be beneficial in either of those areas. Both the models and the training data just don't exist. You would have to model an entire cell with millions of molecular interactions every second in order to predict what would happen in silicon with any amount of accuracy. Targeted biological research with model systems is still very much important for high quality science and the next generation of therapeutics.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're pointing to the fundamental complexity of cellular systems and the limitations of current AI models in capturing all those molecular interactions accurately.

When you've used AI for that exploratory coding work you mentioned, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: While my coding dictionary is minimal, I have a good sense of the logical framework that helps me understand what the code is doing to my data. The datasets I am working with are not too complicated, so I can visually validate at key steps what the data looks like and whether things have gone wrong. I will typically do a more manual manipulation alongside the coding and validate at each step before iterating the process.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using your understanding of the logical framework to spot-check the AI's work and running manual validations in parallel. It sounds like you're leveraging your domain knowledge even when the technical coding isn't your primary strength.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Integrating large datasets. Biologists generate massive amounts of data but don't tend to use it the most efficiently. For example, there are lots of publicly available gene expression datasets which exist in isolation. If AI could integrate and normalize all this data in a single repository, it could be a very exciting thing for biological discovery. You could see how expression dynamics change across cell models, tissue types, disease states, and more. That would be a really exciting tool to identify new areas of interest using preexisting data

AI: That's a fascinating vision - essentially having AI create a unified, normalized atlas of all that scattered gene expression data so you could ask much broader comparative questions across different contexts. It sounds like it could really accelerate the hypothesis generation phase of research by revealing patterns that would be nearly impossible to spot when the data exists in silos.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the practical limitations of AI in complex biological systems and the potential for data integration were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Yes. The effects of AI on the publication process are quite worrying, and the system is further shifting in favor of those who know how to game the system rather than those that have the best research to present. As AI inevitably grows in the grant and review process, it is important that the strong scientific practices can still prevail and that safeguards be in place

AI: That's a really important point you're raising about the broader ecosystem impacts - how AI might be changing not just the research process itself, but the evaluation and funding mechanisms that determine which research gets supported and published. The concern about gaming the system versus rewarding quality science is particularly striking.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of where AI can and can't meaningfully contribute to biological research, plus this broader perspective on systemic impacts, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: where could I reach out

AI: That's a great question, and I appreciate you asking. I should clarify - while I've been conducting this interview as part of exploring how AI research might work, I'm actually Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, rather than a human researcher at Anthropic.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I have no questions at this moment.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: A recent project I've worked on is building a 3D model of geologic layers in the subsurface. This kind of model is required (or useful) input for other kinds of models, such as groundwater flow models or carbon sequestration simulations. Most of the data that were collected is old, such as borehole geophysical data from wells drilled for oil and gas exploration or water extraction. I wanted the construction of the model to be scripted so that I could make small changes to my assumptions or methods without needing to manually reprocess data. A big part of the workflow is making subjective choices around how to reconcile existing geologic interpretations. The final product is a series of rasters representing the top elevation of each layer; collectively, these define a 3D geologic model.

AI: That's fascinating work - the idea of creating a scriptable workflow for reconciling those subjective geological interpretations sounds particularly challenging. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm curious about any part of the workflow from handling the old borehole data to making those interpretation decisions to generating the final rasters.

User: I use Python extensively in my work, because it has a lot of support for geospatial processing. From the start I wanted to generalize my processing steps as much as possible and encapsulate them into reusable functions. I am likely to do similar tasks for my job, so I wanted to make as much of this workflow transferable as possible. I primarily used AI to write these functions for me. These functions performed things like conditional filtering of point datasets, manipulating 3D arrays, making interpolated surfaces, and generating visualizations.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to help build those reusable functions sounds like it could really streamline your workflow. 

For writing those Python functions - the filtering, array manipulation, interpolation, and visualization ones - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus writing them yourself from scratch.

User: I found that it was much faster to decompose specific coding problems and communicate what I wanted to an AI rather than writing the code myself. Most of the code was relatively simple and used established libraries, but had complex series of if-then statements. Having AI do the heavy lifting for the code freed up some mental bandwidth for formulating solutions to the problems and reviewing how the code worked in practice, helping me find edge cases.

AI: That's a really interesting way to think about it - using AI to handle the implementation details while you focus on the problem-solving and quality control aspects. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like those subjective choices around reconciling existing geologic interpretations you mentioned - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: Sometimes decisions are made using information that the AI doesn't have access to. For example, there are often outliers in datasets. I could tell the AI to remove outliers, and it might use some statistical approach. However, imagine I have control points defining an elevation surface, and there's an area where the points are much higher than the surrounding points. I know from experience that this is a real geologic feature, because I have paper maps that show it from more detailed studies for this area. The AI doesn't have this information, so it might remove those points. Sure, I could digitize the map and maybe expose the AI model to this information somehow, but at what cost? Now my 120 hour project has become a 300 hour project. It is much easier to just add a comment line saying ""these points are legit, keep them in, refer to this reference for more info"".

AI: That's a really compelling example - the idea that incorporating all that contextual knowledge could actually make the project much more complex rather than helpful. It sounds like there's this sweet spot where AI helps with the more standardized coding tasks, but the domain expertise and contextual decision-making is where you add the most value.

When you have used AI for writing those Python functions, how do you verify or validate what it produces? What's your process for making sure the code does what you actually need it to do?

User: I'll often test the functions on small synthetic datasets. Or, I'll test them on my real dataset and use the visualization tools I've developed to ensure that they're working as intended. Other times I'll probe the AI model and give it a theoretical scenario and have it work through the logic.

AI: That's a smart multi-layered approach - synthetic data, real data visualization, and even theoretical testing with the AI itself. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. I'm curious about your future vision here - if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be nice if AI could better incorporate the contextual information we discussed earlier. In the geosciences, there is actually much information only available from visual sources of information like maps. Also, it is not uncommon to cite something published decades ago.

AI: That's really insightful - the challenge of all that visual and historical knowledge that's locked away in maps and older publications. It sounds like there's this rich repository of geological understanding that's just not easily accessible to current AI systems.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into the more technical coding aspects while domain expertise remains crucial for contextual decisions were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Just one more thing, something I think could be improved. Some AI models remember interactions with the user. I might ask a question about a statistical method to learn about it. Later, I might ask it for advice on how to approach a different problem. The AI models that remember interactions are often biased towards methods I've discussed with it earlier, even if they aren't appropriate for the task at hand.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea that the AI's memory of your past conversations could actually work against you by creating inappropriate biases toward previously discussed methods. It sounds like you'd prefer the AI to evaluate each new problem fresh rather than being influenced by what you've explored before.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about the balance between AI for technical implementation versus human expertise for contextual decision-making really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. And that point about conversational memory potentially creating methodological bias is something we definitely need to consider.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good.  I have no questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your research background. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The research component of my work largely involves statistical modelling using economic data.  This is known as econometrics.    The most recent project I can describe for you involves looking at rental prices in Wellington, New Zealand over a long time period (several decades).  

The initial idea was to examine claims about the behaviour of rents in Wellington City in relation to planning rules.  This is divided into a number of sub-projects, each of which has one or two compenents.   The first project was to obtain and analyse information on the behaviour of rents. I will describe the first sub-component of that here. 

New Zealand has a long term database of rentals by location, type of rental (ie flat, apartment or standalone house), number of bedrooms, and amount of rent.  This is comprehensive because it is based on bonds, which must by law be lodged with the Goverment at the start of a tenancy.  Everytime someone lodges or amends a bond, the details of the tenancy are updated.  This database goes back to 1993, and location is defined at the level of suburb for anonymity.  One great advantage is that as boundaries change, the information is updated so that all data back to 1993 uses current spatial boundaries. 

The data can be accessed via an API.  Access requires registration to use.  The initial step was to obtain a sample of data for one sub-area for the period from 1993 to 2023 (this was arbitrary, its a test dataset).  We spent considerable time working out the best way to store this in a form amenable to analysis.  In the end we went with an Excel Workbooks for each type of rental, with one sheet for each no of rooms and data organised horizontally by year.  This enabled us to aggregate up the levels of data.  We tried using AI to look at how to store the data and then to suggest a structure for the data but its performance was very poor.  

We then visualised the data to get an overall sense of the patterns, and whether - for example - over this length of time - there appeared to be any difference between patterns we saw across the number of rooms and across the rental type. Again we tried using AI to speed this up but it could not grasp the structure of the data.  We observed that there was much more seasonal variation in the rentals for larger flats; this likely reflected university student demand.  

The next step was to analyse the data in a number of ways.  What we wanted to do was calculate an overall ""cost per room"" and look at the behaviour of this over time. To do this we needed to calculate the mean room cost weighted by the number of rentals of a given type and the rent for that type for each period.  This is complicated as the rents shown are themselves geometric means of individual data points.   We tried investigating this using AI but it could not work with this level of complexity.  

We then analysed this series to see if there were any break points in the data, and observed three.  One has no clear explanation, while one clearly related to the opening of a new university and the other was COVID related.   The outcome is a smoothed set of data points for a sample suburb, which give us a clear pattern for the cost of a room over a twenty year period. 

The next sub-part of this is to recreate this for all the suburbs in the city and for the city as a whole as well as some sensible sub-units.

AI: That's a fascinating project - the complexity of working with longitudinal rental data and the challenge of creating meaningful aggregations across different property types really comes through. 

You mentioned trying to use AI at several points but finding its performance was ""very poor"" - it couldn't grasp the data structure or work with the level of complexity you needed. Tell me more about that. What exactly did you try to get the AI to help with, and what happened when you did?

User: The first time we used AI was to ask about how to store data from the API.  It has a number of dimensions, and we needed a sensible way of setting it out that would enable analysis of aggregated and disaggregated data.  We spent (really wasted) about half a day or more trying to get the AI to grasp what we needed but it failed to understand the structure of the data - we even cut and pasted the description from the API interface - but it could not understand what was needed.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - spending half a day on something and getting nowhere. When you say it failed to understand the structure of the data, what kinds of suggestions was the AI giving you that made it clear it wasn't grasping what you needed?

User: We needed a data structure that enabled us to reach cost per room across different rental types and number of bedrooms.  The AI kept suggesting storing the data in ways that would make this hard or impossible.  For example, it suggested creating a database and could not understand that we were getting data from a database and needed a more tractable way to store it.  When we forced it to focus on Excel Sheets, it could not set out a structure that worked up from a table in a sheet, through multiple tabs, to multiple workbooks.  It made weird suggesting, like adding together the unweighted values from different rooms.

AI: So it sounds like the AI was missing the hierarchical nature of what you needed - that you had to build up from individual data points to aggregate measures across multiple dimensions. When it suggested things like adding unweighted values from different rooms, that must have made it clear it didn't understand the statistical principles behind what you were trying to accomplish.

When you moved to the visualization stage and tried AI again, what did you ask it to help with there?

User: We asked the AI to pull out the data points we described and plot them in a time series graph.  The AI could not read the spreadsheets properly, hallucinated data and could not seem to grasp the idea of a simple time series graph.

AI: That's quite striking - it couldn't even handle the basic mechanics of reading your spreadsheet data correctly. The hallucination of data points is particularly concerning when you're trying to do rigorous research.

For the statistical analysis part where you needed to calculate the weighted mean room costs - that geometric means complexity you mentioned - what did you try to get AI to help with there, and how did that go wrong?

User: So, calculating weighted arithmetic means of geometric means creates some complexity around standard errors (to put mildly).  We have no access to the original data so we needed best practice defensible approximations for standard errors.  The AI seemed to struggle to grasp the specifics of our situation, and kept producing standard formulas.   It would describe (or at least reflect) what we wanted correctly but then not be able to translate this into a bespoke approach for us.  In the end, we used our networks to find a specialist who said there was no gold standard but suggested a couple of options and if both gave similar results that was defensible.

AI: That's a really telling example - the AI could parrot back your problem correctly but couldn't make the intellectual leap to develop a specialized approach for your unique statistical situation. It sounds like it defaulted to textbook solutions rather than grappling with the nuances.

You ended up going to a human specialist through your networks who gave you practical guidance about defensible approaches. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't tried using AI - what's kept you from experimenting with it in those areas?

User: To be honest, the biggest barrier was our experience when we did try to use AI.  We tried to get AI working as a trusted research assistant, and as a source of specialist knowledge and it failed at both.  I was interested in trying AI because I do some work for [REDACTED] and often try AI out of curiosity.  The area where it has been really helpful is identifying research, in that sense its invaluable.  But for more complex bespoke tasks, its been a waste of time.  Sometimes I quite enjoy trying to coach the AI to do what we need, but at times it will just get stuck or even argue back with nonsense so it isn't really a valuable use of time.

AI: That makes complete sense - after those early experiences, why would you keep trying for complex analytical tasks? It's interesting that you've found real value in AI for research identification though. 

Tell me more about how you use it for identifying research - what does that look like in practice, and how does that experience differ from when you tried to use it for the more complex analytical work?

User: Sure - here's a real query from some other work.  This is a good example of something that worked reasonably well:

I am interested in the spacing of urban bus stops. Often it is claimed that 400m is optimal. However I am having difficulty tracking down references for this, other that ""evidence shows"" or unreferenced claims in documents. What I am interested in is finding the origin of this, and research that assesses the impact of people with impairments, those with children etc. I am also interested in any more nuanced or sophisticated paradigms that may take into account geography / topography etc

AI: That's a perfect example of where AI seems to excel for you - helping you trace the origins of claims and find relevant literature across different aspects of a research question. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. When you've used AI for research identification like that bus stop example, how do you verify or validate what it produces? Do you have a different approach to checking its work for literature searches versus the analytical tasks you tried earlier?

User: So in the above example, I will ask for references / citations and then check them to find the claims made by the AI.  To be honest, about half the time the AI will give quotes that don't exist.  But overall the process is much faster that any alternative, and it almost always finds some directly relevant material.  The value is greatest when I can easily check the AI's claims about relevance.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using it as an efficient starting point even knowing that about half the citations might be fabricated, because you can quickly verify the ones that do exist and they often lead to genuinely relevant material.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - either something you haven't tried or something where it failed before - what would that be and why?

User: The most useful thing I could get from an AI would be help writing funding applications.  These can be tedious and its hard to sound novel and excited after the firth application in a row.  What I would really like from an AI would be the ability to accurately grab information, summarise it and use it to write the core of a funding application.  AI generally writes well; he problem now is that I just can't rely on it not hallucinating, or to put it bluntly, lying.  The possibility of nonsense means I can't send an application in, as it will be reviewed by people who know the subject.  The amount of time needed to check makes it faster to do draft myself (spoken and then AI transcribed), and then put it through something like Grammarly.

AI: That really captures the core tension - AI's writing ability could be genuinely transformative for those repetitive funding applications, but the hallucination risk makes it unusable when experts will be reviewing your work. The stakes are just too high.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on AI as a research identification tool versus its limitations for complex analytical work were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No - my sense at the moment is that AI is REALLY good at guessing; it always produces answers that look and sound like a correct answer but may be nonsense.  The real challenge for AI development is to be able to weed out the nonsense from the gems to a much greater extent.  In fiels like mine, where there aren't always formulas to apply or a funnel down which you can narrow things, AI still has a long way to go.  When I see AI step back and look for context, then I'll feel that the ""I"" part of AI is getting close to being accurate.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - AI as fundamentally a very sophisticated guessing system that hasn't yet developed the ability to truly contextualize and self-correct in the nuanced ways that rigorous research demands.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the fundamental challenge of separating AI's ""gems from nonsense"" and the need for true contextual reasoning really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The contrast between its value for research identification versus its failures in complex analytical tasks gives us a lot to think about.

science_0122,"Assistant: Hi there, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was working on getting ideas for a dissertation I have in mind for the treatment of C. difficile

AI: That sounds like important research. Tell me more about that process - how did you go about developing and exploring those ideas for your C. difficile treatment dissertation?

User: I am still mulling over the type of dissertation (i.e, the methodology and structure) I would like to do.  I know it will be a masters level thesis so my main focus would be researching peer reviewed studies on c.diff treatments.  So I researched ""getting ideas for a thesis on c.diff treatment peer review"".  The NIH had several studies of interest.  I selected five studies, copied and pasted their summaries into AI and asked it to compare and contrast the summaries by having it use key words such as ""treatment"", ""patient response"", "" further research"" etc.  I used the results of this to generate a series of interesting questions for myself to explore further.

AI: That's a really helpful overview of your process. You mentioned using AI to compare and contrast those five study summaries - tell me more about how you decided to use AI for that particular step versus analyzing those summaries yourself in your traditional way.

User: Having AI search for keywords reduced the time I would have taken to read the papers.  It helped me hone in on the papers/paragraphes that were specific to my goal.

AI: That makes sense - the time savings and focus seem really valuable. When you had AI analyze those summaries and it generated results highlighting treatment, patient response, and further research themes, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced before using those insights to generate your research questions?

User: If a reference was provided by the authors, I would go to the bibliography in the paper, find the research title, look for it online and read it.  If there were something of real interest in the actual study, I would search for the keyword (or now a phrase related to the word) in the paper to find out how the ""conclusion"" was generated from the study's results.

AI: That's a thorough verification approach. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process for this dissertation - like developing your methodology, structuring your thesis, or writing sections - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas, if anything?

User: I haven't begun developing my methodology as yet as I am still at the ""Defining my thesis statement"".  However, I did not use AI to generate my list of research ideas because it is what interests my and where my personal strengths lie that will help me determine my statement. Looking forward, I will use AI to help me find more connections (similar studies) to my statement.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you see a clear distinction between where your personal interests and judgment are essential versus where AI can help with information discovery and connections.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research process that it currently doesn't help with, what would that be and why?

User: Maybe it would be useful to know what areas of research need more research (what is a unique, less studied area of research) so that I could be more confident that I am conducting a study on a topic that is not already well-studied and one that will be helpful to the community.

AI: That's a really thoughtful wish - identifying research gaps and ensuring your work contributes something genuinely new to the field. That would certainly help with confidence in your research direction.

We're wrapping up now, and your perspectives on using AI strategically for information processing while keeping personal judgment central to defining your research focus have been particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think it is important to remember that AI is a tool that can be helpful, and it should be embraced as such. However, I am cautious about using it because sometimes I have found that it makes up research (even with citations), so it becomes a more onerous task if I am asking AI to come up with ""original ideas"".  For now, I will stick to having it help me make connections/analyze already published papers so that I can verify the research myself.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about using AI strategically as a verification-friendly tool while being appropriately cautious about its limitations - especially that distinction between using it for analysis versus original idea generation - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Your approach of leveraging AI's strengths in pattern recognition and connection-making while maintaining rigorous verification practices seems like a thoughtful way to integrate these tools into research workflows.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you again for your time and valuable perspectives!

User: thanks! bye!

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for participating - your insights were really valuable. Take care and best of luck with your C. difficile research! Bye!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I've been working with my student on investigating the effects of high pressure processing on acidified broth, designed to mimic fruit juices. We have been looking at the effects of pressure, process time, sample pH, and acidulant on E. coli and Listeria.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project! Can you tell me more about what that research process looked like from start to finish - from when you first had the idea to investigate these pressure processing effects all the way through to where you are now with the results?

User: I had the idea when I was in grad school, but I didn't get a chance to look into it until I started as a professor. My student worked on the literature review and developing the experimental protocols, and I helped her pick appropriate variables and formulate the research questions and project objectives. We currently have all the results and have performed ANOVA and are starting with model development where we aim to fit a secondary model to explain pH, pressure, and time effects for each microorganism and acidulant combination. We have also collected a set of data on real fruit juices to understand the practical feasibility of applying our data in real-world products.

AI: That's a comprehensive study with multiple phases. Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Yes, not initially, but when it came time to analyze the data, I started using ChatGPT to help me write some code and get ideas for the secondary models. I mostly used it as a check for my student's work.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided to bring ChatGPT into the data analysis phase. What made you think to try it for writing code and checking your student's work rather than sticking with your traditional approach?

User: I've wanted to learn R for a long time, but I've never had the chance to get a class that would give me the experience I felt I needed. I know Matlab but since it's not open-source, I would need a subscription and I didn't want to rely on that long-term. I figured if I could get the R code through ChatGPT, check it against what my student was doing, and understand how it worked, I'd be starting to learn more of the nuance that I was looking for. Honestly I wouldn't have known how to help my student with her code if something was off without AI tools.

AI: That's really interesting - you used it as both a learning tool and a way to support your student. When you get R code from ChatGPT, how do you go about verifying that it's actually working correctly and producing reliable results for your analysis?

User: I had a gut feeling based on visuals what the results should be. I plotted all of the data first so I sort of knew what to expect. Of course there were some surprises, but that's how research works! I was also able to verify the results against Matlab which was helpful.

AI: That makes sense - using your domain expertise and cross-validation with Matlab as checks. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the literature review, experimental design, data collection - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I honestly didn't know much about AI tools in this part of the project, so I didn't use them simply because I didn't have or want access. One of my hesitations is being able to publish my work and ensuring that my work is entirely original. I think if I were to use AI in literature review, I might take an approach of letting it find papers and put together an annotated bibliography. My only worry with that is whether it has found all of the relevant papers and whether the information in the annotations are accurate and relevant to the study so I don't include or exclude things mistakenly. For the experimental design part, I honestly think that is fun, but I am interested in seeing what AI would say and how it can help me think about analysis BEFORE the experiments are done so I don't miss anything important like appropriate controls and ranges of variables.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on the tradeoffs. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - or doesn't do well enough for you to trust it - what would that be and why?

User: For me personally, the literature review part I just mentioned. There are soooo many papers out there and I find is difficult and boring to keep up. For society in general, I'd say experimental design and data analysis planning. I have read way too many studies that don't use helpful data analysis techniques and then the data ends up being kind of useless for people like me who develop models.

AI: Those are really insightful points - both about the overwhelming volume of literature and the broader issue with experimental design that could benefit the whole field. 

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on using AI as a learning bridge to new programming languages and your thoughtful concerns about maintaining research integrity were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think it's necessary that we start thinking about AI as a helpful tool and not a scary thing that helps students cheat. I've seen both sides of the story, but I really want us to get better about understanding and sharing about how we can teach people to use AI to help rather than restrict its use entirely for fear of dishonesty.

AI: Thank you so much for that perspective - that's such an important point about shifting from restriction to education around responsible AI use. Your insights about using AI as a learning bridge for R programming and your careful approach to verification really help us understand the nuances of how AI can fit into real scientific work in productive ways.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly today. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your time and thoughtful responses are really valuable to our understanding of how researchers are navigating this evolving landscape.

User: Appreciate the chance to chat! I am closing the conversation.

AI: Thank you so much! It was really great talking with you and learning about your research. Take care!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I've been working on a project to develop better controls for IHC staining used in medical diagnosis. The project is primarily focused on improving accuracy and precision in cancer diagnosis but will likely be applicable to other areas.

AI: That sounds like really important work. Tell me more about what that process looked like - from when you first had the idea to improve IHC staining controls to where you are now with the project.

User: The idea grew out of other work that my lab was already doing. We knew that lack of reliable controls (both positive and negative) is a general problem with using IHC staining for diagnosis. The initial idea was something of a ""light bulb"" moment so we immediately shifted some of our work in other areas to this project. The first phase involved general viability investigation through literature and patent searchers. Once we were confident that the idea had serious merit and wasn't already something that was in use or patented we decided to proceed. A section of the laboratory was partitioned off as dedicated space, appropriate personnel were assigned to the project, and we began developing research plans and budgets for the work. The project is now in its third year.

AI: That's a fascinating journey from that initial light bulb moment to where you are now in year three. I'm curious - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? This could be during your literature searches, research planning, data analysis, or any other part of the workflow you just described.

User: Our primary use of AI has been in literature search and patent evaluation. Because this is a new idea, we have been using AI to identify work in similar areas and create summaries of those publications for quick evaluation by humans.

AI: That makes a lot of sense for speeding up that initial research phase. For those literature searches and patent evaluations specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding and summarizing relevant work.

User: Because this project involves a wide range of research techniques that we didn't have already set up and running in the lab, we used AI to search and summarize information in areas where our expertise was lacking. For instance, we knew that the project would require insect cell culture but none of had experience in that area. We used AI to help us to select the appropriate cell types and culture conditions that were necessary for the work.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a way to quickly get up to speed in areas outside your core expertise. It sounds like AI became a bridge to knowledge you needed but didn't have in-house.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the actual experimental work, data analysis, or other aspects of the project - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: We're still not 100% convinced that AI is reliable enough to replace a human when it comes to things like data analysis. We've seen several instances where AI has produced summaries of papers or patents that were misleading or contained outright incorrect information. Our confidence in AI just isn't high enough at the moment to trust it with our data. We're also a commercial entity so there a bit of concern over confidentially with data that we might share with an AI system.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the reliability issues you've experienced firsthand and the confidentiality considerations as a commercial entity. 

When you have used AI for those literature searches and patent summaries, how do you verify or validate what it produces, especially given that you've caught misleading or incorrect information before?

User: We only use summaries produced by the AI system as a quick screen for publications that we might have interest in. For instance, AI has been extremely good at helping us quickly identify papers using the particular cells lines were using. Humans use the summaries to pick out interesting publications and then pull the full text for a thorough review.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI as an initial screening tool rather than as the final word. It sounds like you've found that sweet spot where AI adds value while still maintaining human oversight.

We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm really getting a clear picture of how you're thoughtfully integrating AI into specific parts of your workflow.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - whether that's because of reliability concerns, confidentiality issues, or it just doesn't exist yet - what would that be and why?

User: The place we could really use AI's help is in protocol development. It would be great to simply ask AI things like ""What's the most often used method for purifying XXX?"" or ""Help me develop a protocol for FPLC separation of this protein."" Unfortunately, our attempts at asking those kinds of questions have led to unsatisfactory answers.

AI: That's such a specific and valuable use case - having AI help with the nuts and bolts of experimental design and protocol development. It sounds like there's real potential there, but the current quality isn't meeting your standards.

When you say the answers have been unsatisfactory, what exactly was missing or problematic about the protocols or methods AI suggested? Was it that they were too generic, outdated, or something else entirely?

User: The answers in this area we've gotten back from AI have often included incomplete information. For instance, purification protocols will sometimes be missing a critical step or important variables such as temperature. It seems that AI is correctly identifying the problems we're giving it, but it's not quite to the point where it can fully identify what's important to include in an answer.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - AI recognizing the problem correctly but missing those crucial details that make the difference between a protocol that works and one that fails in the lab.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on how you're strategically using AI as a screening tool while being thoughtful about its limitations have been particularly insightful. You've painted a clear picture of someone who's found practical value in AI while maintaining appropriate skepticism based on real experience.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Nope. I think that's all.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a screening tool while maintaining rigorous human oversight, and especially your point about AI missing critical protocol details, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's clear you've developed a very practical and measured approach to AI integration - leveraging its strengths for literature screening while being appropriately cautious about areas where reliability and completeness are critical.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!"
