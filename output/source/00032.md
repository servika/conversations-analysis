Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good Im ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent project was developing a CubeSat a small satellite for detecting space debris in low earth orbit. I joined the project half way through the development of the satellite so it was a lot of initial familiarising myself with the project reading lots of papers on the current design and reviewing technical details of the satellite. After the initial familiarising our team worked on advancing the design further with my technical area being the On-Board Data Handling (OBDH) system. This involved researching extensively into how OBDH systems functioned, what components are necessary, how data is managed and proceed etc. Then going on to create a physical and functional architectures for the OBDH system outlining the components, how they functioned and interacted with the rest of the satellite. This culminated a joint paper being produced (300+ pages) by my team on the improved design of the satellite

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive project - from joining mid-development to contributing to a 300+ page technical paper. The progression from initial familiarization through research and design to final documentation gives me a good sense of your workflow.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: A lot of my AI use during the project was for doing research. I found it very useful to ask ChatGPT deep research to find me papers, for example on OBDH design in CubeSats and it would return a lot of useful resources and summaries of the papers that it found. I would then review the papers myself and take the information I needed as the summaries weren't always accurate. I also used it a lot of parsing documents so I would upload a pdf into the AI agent and ask it to find specific information and tell me what page it is on. This saved a lot of time as it saved me from reading through pages of documents to find one specific technical detail that I wanted

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you found AI particularly valuable for those initial research and information-gathering phases. The document parsing capability especially seems like it saved you significant time.

For the research assistance you mentioned - finding papers and getting summaries - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those tasks.

User: Traditional methods require a lot of time and resources to look through a bunch of papers and then find papers that are relevant. Using this method there can be a lot of wasted time looking at irrelevant or unhelpful resources. VS with AI it does the looking for you can mostly returns relevant articles and papers so it saves a lot of time that would be wasted using traditional methods

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the efficiency gain from having AI pre-filter and surface relevant papers rather than manually sifting through potentially irrelevant ones sounds significant.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like developing the physical and functional architectures or the technical design work - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I think AI hasn't gotten to the point where it can create accurate detailed technical drawings and designs yet. I have tried asking AI to produced technical outputs but the response are either inaccurate or cannot produce the desired output to a good enough level of detail

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI seems effective for information processing and research tasks but not yet capable of producing the technical precision your design work requires.

When you've used AI for research assistance and document parsing, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: Any source the AI gives me I check over myself to verify the contents of it and if the source is actually relevant. For document parsing i always ask it to give me the page number and where it found information so I can look at it myself

AI: That verification approach sounds really practical - essentially using AI as a first-pass filter while maintaining your own oversight. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would probably say making technical drawings would be amazing as it would save a lot of time using CAD software's to create the designs

AI: That would be a significant time-saver - being able to generate technical CAD drawings directly rather than having to manually create them in specialized software. The precision requirements you mentioned earlier make sense for why that's not feasible yet but would be so valuable if it worked reliably.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as an efficient research filter while maintaining verification practices, and the clear boundaries you've identified between where AI helps versus where technical precision is still needed, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No I think that is it

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI serves as an effective research assistant while still requiring human verification, and the clear distinction between information processing tasks versus technical design work, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's particularly valuable to hear how you've found that sweet spot of using AI to save time on research and document parsing while recognizing its current limitations for precision technical outputs. Your approach of always asking for page numbers and sources shows a really thoughtful way of leveraging AI's strengths while maintaining scientific rigor.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
