Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm happy with that, please proceed.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI quite extensively but find it much more useful for some tasks than others. A lot of my work requires detailed analysis and strategic thinking and although AI is often good at the core number crunching it misses a huge number of the strategic thinking elements that are required to make sound business decisions. Where I do find it particularly useful is when it comes to copywriting, it's a great tool to use when I need to shorten text or reword things to avoid using the same words over and over. I very rarely use a thesaurus these days because of AI. I'm using image and video generation tools ever increasingly too and suspect that this will increase as the technology improves over the coming years.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where AI excels versus where you need to rely on your own judgment. 

When you mention that AI misses strategic thinking elements for business decisions, can you tell me more about what specifically it tends to overlook or get wrong in those situations?

User: Sure, most of my work has a "real world" element to it and I don't think AI has developed a full understanding of the differing types of human behaviour and how this can translate to purchasing decisions...  yet. This may come in time as the models continue to be trained and developed. The advice that AI tends to currently provide is very generic and honestly not very insightful in most cases, I'm yet to come across a situation where an AI assistant has truly thought outside the box and made me sit up and take notice. I've tried various assistants too, with the premium options of the latest available models so it's not as though I'm reliant on cheap/entry level assistants.

AI: That's a really valuable perspective - you're essentially saying that despite trying the best available models, they're still missing that nuanced understanding of human behavior that drives real business insights.

When you do use AI for those copywriting and rewording tasks, how do you typically work with it? Do you find yourself going back and forth with it to refine the output, or does it usually get you what you need in one go?

User: Yes, that's a good way of summarising what I'm saying. Regarding the copywriting/rewording I use it as a refining tool similar to what you've suggested - there is lots of back and forth involved. I don't use AI tools to create articles from scratch, what I do is create a rough draft myself to begin with (this is often very wordy and basically a brain dump of all the content I want to get into the piece) then utilise AI to initially cut out all the unnecessary waffle and then continuously refine it until we finish with something very polished and concise without omitting any content. This is a true collaborative process, I don't always use the AI's suggestions but even when I don't I've found it's steered me in the right direction.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really effective - using your initial brain dump as the foundation and then working together to refine it. It's interesting that even when you don't take the AI's specific suggestions, it still helps guide your thinking.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you don't use it to create articles from scratch - are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I'm still doing a lot of my own admin and honestly - I hate it. It's boring, tedious and not a good use of my time. I would love to be able to delegate all of that to AI so that all I have to do is briefly check it and sign it off at the end. To give some examples of the admin I'm talking about, it could be sending invoices, logging expenses, creating documents for my accountants etc.

AI: That's such a relatable frustration - having those time-consuming admin tasks that you know aren't the best use of your skills. 

What's currently preventing you from delegating those admin tasks to AI? Is it a technical limitation, or are there other barriers getting in the way?

User: It's mainly technical, for example if such a tool existed where I could feed in my business bank account transactions, photograph receipts for non-online business transactions, automatically be able to send anything relevant to my accountant/HMRC/others as necessary at the touch of a button it would be fantastic. App based digital banking and off the shelf solutions (e.g. Quickbooks) can provide these things to a certain degree but there isn't a one stop shop that ties everything together... if AI could do that I'd be a customer from day one!

AI: That vision of a unified AI system that could handle all those interconnected admin tasks sounds incredibly appealing - especially having it automatically know what needs to go to your accountant versus HMRC.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others around you are using it similarly, or are there different approaches?

User: It's very much a mixed bag, there are some that use AI all the time and barely do anything without it, dare I say overuse it. With these folk it's almost feels like they've over-delegated their work to it and barely have a thought of their own without using it - this can often show up when I hold them to account in meetings. On the flip side there are some that don't use it at all and might even be a little scared of it. With these folk they're retaining their own abilities to perform their roles but their productivity seems to be diminishing because they're spending too long doing things totally manually in situations where AI would be very useful. Personally I use AI more than most but not for everything for the reasons already outlined.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the two extremes - the over-delegators who struggle when questioned, and those avoiding it entirely at the cost of productivity. It sounds like you've found a middle ground.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'll give you one of each. I was particularly satisfied when I used the collaborative copywriting techniques I mentioned earlier to refresh the entire content on a website. This worked incredibly well with increased customer engagement (measured by decreased bounce rates and increased time spent on site) without any changes to the site itself aside from the copy. It ultimately led to improved SEO rankings too. On the flip side I get particularly frustrated when I ask AI to create macros for my most complex spreadsheets... the amount of errors and going around in circles is infuriating.

AI: That's a perfect contrast - the website copy success story really demonstrates that collaborative approach paying off with measurable results, while the macro frustration sounds maddening.

With the spreadsheet macros specifically, what tends to go wrong? Is it that the AI doesn't understand the complexity of what you're trying to achieve, or does it create code that just doesn't work properly?

User: Honestly - both! But it depends what "mood" the AI tends to be in! When it works it's brilliant and a massive time saver (otherwise I have to filter manually and it can take hours in some circumstances) but when it doesn't work I often wonder why I bothered even asking it in the first place because it becomes a waste of time. I can give it a pass when I'm asking something truly complex but on other occasions it will provide a perfectly good macro, then "forget" and start providing faulty ones thereafter even if I only want one small parameter changed... it's infuriating.

AI: That inconsistency must be incredibly frustrating - especially when it starts well and then seems to "lose the thread" on what should be simple modifications. The unpredictability makes it hard to know when to rely on it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: To a certain degree but I'm not personally concerned about being "replaced" by AI like some people are. I have a natural desire to learn and improve all the time and if we reach a point where AI can do most of what I do in my current role I'll have already found a way to pivot into something else where I can utilise my skill set anyway. I think it's important to stay up to date with the latest technologies and use them if they're beneficial, no point trying to swim against a tide, better off surfing and using the waves to your advantage.

AI: That's a really healthy perspective - using the waves to your advantage rather than fighting against them. Your adaptability mindset seems to serve you well.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in particular ways as the technology continues to develop?

User: I think it's going to take some time before it reaches the level of strategic thinking that's required to do my role and it might never even achieve that. Where I do think it will improve significantly in the short/medium term is where it comes to the elimination of time consuming manual tasks and I'll use it all the more the better it gets at that. For example, to refer back to the macro problems I mentioned earlier in the relatively near future I probably won't need it to create these any more... because traditional spreadsheets probably won't exist and any data that's currently held within spreadsheets will be available through AI portals where you just "ask" for data and it provides it back. Similar to this really. Once those kind of tools are widespread I can spend more time on the complex, strategic thinking that I enjoy most and is simultaneously the best use of my time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on finding that middle ground between over-delegation and avoidance, and your vision of how AI might eliminate the need for traditional spreadsheets altogether.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's everything covered for now. I've enjoyed that and glad you've found my insights useful!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach to copywriting, the frustrations with inconsistent macro creation, and especially your thoughtful perspective on strategic thinking versus manual task elimination will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the successes and the limitations you've encountered. Have a great rest of your day!
