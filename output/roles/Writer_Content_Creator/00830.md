Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Great, I don't have any questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Several ways. I work for an educational library serving engineers and scientists. It also has a historical collection and archive. I often use AI to help me research for enquiries. For example, I frequently ask AI to identify specific articles, papers, books etc. if users have given me a partial reference or for a particular piece of historical information. As the user base have broad interests the enquiries frequently include subjects I'm not familiar with and it's useful to ask AI about queries to give me a quick overview or guide for the direction of my research. Further, I use AI to help research and apply for funding, and on occasion to write social media posts.

AI: That sounds like AI helps you navigate quite a diverse range of subject areas. When you're dealing with these enquiries from users who have partial references or are looking for historical information, how does that research process typically unfold?

Are you feeding the partial information to AI first to get leads, or do you use it differently in that workflow?

User: I often use it after my first search has failed. For example, if I've checked out catalogue and I suspect someone has got the incorrect date or wrong author for a paper I might then ask the AI to help. Sometimes if a query comes in that's very obscure (like, "I want a paper that might have been written in the 1870s and published in x journal or x conference proceeding) I'll go straight to AI for help.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI becomes your backup when traditional search methods hit a wall, or your first stop for those particularly challenging needles-in-a-haystack queries.

When you do turn to AI in those moments, what does success look like? Are you typically looking for AI to give you the exact answer, or are you more hoping it points you toward promising directions to pursue?

User: Both really. It's great when I find the answer and obviously that's a great success. The other thing that's really helpful is if I don't turn up an answer, and then I got to AI to confirm that I've not missed any key piece of information. That actually makes me way more efficient. I could spend half a day trying to confirm that I've turned every stone with a particular query and having AI as a sounding board gets things done quicker.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds significant - having that validation that you haven't missed anything major. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your research process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those different for you?

User: No, not really. I think AI is a great tool, but we're still at the stage where I have to check most things. I enjoy research so it's no hardship really. It's more of a collaborative thing for me and my work. As I'm a lone worker it is nice to be able to bounce things off someone as though it's a conversation.

AI: That collaborative aspect sounds really valuable - having that conversational partner when you're working on your own. 

When you describe it as collaborative, I'm curious about how that typically plays out in practice. Are you more likely to work back-and-forth with AI throughout a research task, or do you find yourself giving it complete pieces to handle while you focus on other parts?

User: It's almost always a back and forth. I'll ask a few questions, ask for thoughts, ask if I've missed anything, and if I get a new piece of information or have a theory ask whether the AI thinks my idea is likely to be accurate. If I'm asking for output (i.e. social posts), I frequently ask for tweaks in tone or slightly different focus.

AI: That back-and-forth dynamic sounds like it really suits your work style. The way you describe checking theories and getting that second opinion - it sounds like AI fills a particular gap for someone working independently.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that environment shaped how you approach it at all?

User: Yes, it has. I have no other staff members and filled a role that had been empty for a significant amount of time. Nobody else knows the answers to my questions.

AI: That really puts your AI use in context - you're essentially building expertise in a role without having predecessors or colleagues to learn from. That must make AI particularly valuable as that conversational partner you mentioned.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, I found an 18th century bust hidden in an old storeroom. The archive information had the man listed as "?". Some cursive inside the bust had a name that I couldn't read. I used AI to decipher the writing, and then talked through several options for who the bust might be of. We finally discovered it was a bust of an influential scientist. This info had been lost and wouldn't have been recovered without the help of AI. The bust is now on display.

AI: What a fantastic discovery! That's such a perfect example of how AI can help recover lost knowledge - from deciphering the cursive writing to working through the possibilities of who it might be. That must have been incredibly satisfying to see it go from a mystery "?" to being properly identified and displayed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider it, but personally, I'm not concerned. It's a perfect parallel to other historic advancements for example the mills of the industrial revolution. It might be painful while we make the transition, but in the long term it's better that people don't have to work in mills. I'm hopeful that AI will give humans more freedom to pursue less mundane lives. In terms of my own work I'm not concerned either. I'm happy to have AI's help in things I can't research, it makes me more effective in my role as a librarian, and the time I save can be put into more interesting training.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing it through the lens of historical technological shifts. The idea of AI freeing up time for more interesting training sounds like you see it as expanding rather than limiting your professional development.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops or as you get more experience with it?

User: Absolutely. I hope it can streamline my interactions with users and make queries even more efficient. I'd love to be able to let AI loose on the archive records I have and bring new elements out. As its image recognition improves it will be really interesting to see whether it can read and interpret my oldest manuscripts effectively. It's already helped me to implement a moisture monitoring system and I hope it will be able to help me look after the physical collections more effectively.

AI: That's fascinating - the potential for AI to help preserve and unlock your historical collections, from manuscripts to environmental monitoring. It sounds like you see AI as becoming even more integral to both the research and preservation sides of your work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the historical parallel with industrial advancement and how you've found AI to be such a valuable collaborative partner in your independent work setting.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thanks, no that's it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research partner, especially in that fascinating example with the 18th century bust, and your thoughtful perspective on how AI fits into the broader arc of technological progress - it's all incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
