Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, ok to start!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My typical workday doesn't make extensive use of AI. Sometimes when an email needs to be refined in tone, it's run through chatGPT and then re-reviewed by a human to confirm that the essential meaning has been preserved. This is most often happening to keep emails sounding pleasant and friendly in tone.

AI: Tell me more about that email refinement process. What prompts you to decide that an email needs that tone adjustment?

User: We often deal with situations like complaints and financial disputes, so these have to be handled with sensitivity. If something's been written out initially in response to a sensitive situation and it isn't quite sounding empathetic enough, or some of the language reads as harsh, we can ask chatGPT to rewrite it "with a focus on refining the tone to sound pleasant and professional".

AI: That's really interesting. When you're dealing with those sensitive situations like complaints and financial disputes, are there certain types of responses you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even though AI could help with the tone refinement?

User: If the initial draft communications are "hitting the mark" in terms of politely explaining to the customer what can and cannot be done in response to the complaint, we prefer not to use AI, as for those ones, it would be faster not to.

AI: That makes sense - efficiency seems to play a big role in your decision. When you do use AI for those tone refinements, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you working back and forth with it to get the right tone, or do you tend to give it the draft and use what it produces?

User: The AI element is more supplemental to the human work, rather than being used as the primary means of producing communications. So we will send the drafted email to chatGPT, with identifying details removed, and give a prompt like "Can you rewrite this email so that the basic message of your invoice still being payable remains, but refine the tone to be more pleasant and sympathetic? In particular, find a different way to phrase "your case is not a special exception"

AI: That's a very specific approach - using it as a refinement tool rather than a primary drafting tool. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team approach it similarly, or have you seen different patterns?

User: Some people use it more than others. I tend to prefer to use it less than most other people on my team, since I don't find myself often in a situation where I'm unable to come up with a message I'm satisfied with. I also find myself more likely to remember more fully what communications I've sent out if I've drafted them fully independently. AI drafts also have to be reviewed by a person, which takes extra time. So the time saved by use of AI is minimal.

AI: You mentioned that you prefer to use it less because you remember communications better when you've drafted them independently. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The last time I was using AI, I was earlier in my job with less experience, and while working on solving a financial dispute with a colleague, we asked chatGPT to refine the message we planned to send out to the customer before finally re-editing and sending it. This was ultimately satisfying because chatGPT quickly produced a reworked version. The frustrating thing was that we still had to review it, and we could have used that 'review' time coming up with our own edits that would be more 'authentic'.

AI: That tension between efficiency and authenticity is really insightful. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm working in local government customer communications. In this position, it wouldn't be feasible to use AI exclusively with no human oversight. I've also found that the quality of the output from AI depends on how carefully and comprehensively people are able to instruct it. We are also still responsible as people for all outgoing communications, so we still need to oversee  and refine what the AI is producing. My skills applicable here are knowing how to recognize good writing and editing text. I've had to maybe add the ability to prompt AI in ways that yield substantive improvements without a lot of back-and-forth. It's not necessarily a risk of being taken over by AI, but learning ways to work with AI to improve quality and efficiency.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As AI becomes more sophisticated and my workplace gets access to more refined systems, I imagine we will be using it for billing data validation more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the balance between efficiency and authenticity, and how you think about AI as supplemental rather than primary to human work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no, that about covers my experience with AI at work!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a refinement tool rather than a primary drafting method, and your thoughtful approach to balancing efficiency with maintaining authentic communication skills, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
