Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I think I understand the general process and I will ask clarifying questions as needed as we go on. Please, what would you like to know?

AI: Perfect, let's dive in. 

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for all kinds of tasks, from creating and refining problem sets, to integrating ideas, to getting second opinions, performing error analysis, gaining perspective, cleaning up professional emails, organizing admin like scheduling and updating calendars.

AI: That's quite a range of tasks. When you mention using AI for "integrating ideas" and "getting second opinions" - could you walk me through what that looks like in practice? How does that process typically unfold for you?

User: Often when working with students you begin t get an understanding of the way the see things and how their brains might work. At times you notice that certain students might have a proclivity towards visual or linguistic strengths, so you draw on those and build the problems to reflect the core information, but reinforce the technique by paining it in the lens of the students understanding to connect back to the areas that need reinforcement. Working with the AI it is helpful to draw on their knowledge and research to shift standard ideas and questions in math and physics to lean on these areas without losing the content. There is always subtlety in these reworkings so using AI to examine the fine points help eliminate areas of ambiguity and uncertainty I might build into my problem sets

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially using AI as a collaborator to customize learning materials for individual students. When you're working through those subtle reworkings with AI, do you find yourself going back and forth with it multiple times to refine a problem, or do you typically give it all the context upfront and let it handle the adaptation more independently?

User: It depends, some one way, some the other in certain proportions, because I do not always know the direction at first and sometimes a conversation will help.

AI: Tell me more about what determines which approach you take - is it based on the complexity of the concept you're trying to adapt, or something about the student's particular learning profile, or does it emerge as you start working on it?

User: Its really more about my mood, I find that I work different ways based upon how I'm feeling, so sometimes I come in with a broad scope and sometimes I might just dive in with small snippets or even show an AI a problem to solve to see where we might need work

AI: That's really interesting how your emotional state influences your collaboration style with AI. You mentioned that sometimes you'll show AI a problem just to see where work might be needed - when you do that, what are you looking for in how the AI approaches or solves it?

User: i'm looking to see that and if there are any holes in the problem, or anything interesting i might have missed, or just to get started even

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: That is the thing there is no hard and fast rules. Sometimes I like to have AI work up an outline or a draft and I will refine it. Sometimes the other way around. Sometimes I will le the AI crank out a number of problems and then have another AI check f they are right and then check for discrepancies, sometimes I will do everything on my own. It is not a systematic, this or that, it is more how I feel like working or creating in the moment.

AI: So it sounds like your approach is quite fluid and intuitive. When you mention letting one AI generate problems and having another AI check them - that's an interesting workflow. What led you to develop that particular process, and how do you handle it when you find discrepancies between what the two AIs produce?

User: Peer review is an essential part of academics and if AI systems are going to grow to be researchers they will need to have an awareness of their own fallibility. Trusted peers and friends keep you honest and keep your head on straight and feet on the ground. Its important to be open to independent checks

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on building accountability into AI workflows. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your academic environment approaching it similarly, or are you finding different attitudes toward AI integration?

User: There are a lot of different perspectives. There is a lot of excitement around the tools and capabilities. There is also a lot of fear around it. People are afraid of replacement and not feeling like they are needed. It is important to recognize this anxiety. I try to reassure people that new technology and perspective can be scary, yet the benefits are too vast to be ignored and the times too important to turn away from what can really create the possibility of an educational equality where everyone can have access to top notch tutoring and guidance and not just certain segments of society. AI as engines for knowledge which I know math and science to be is a great boon

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time we completed a problem set, coded up the Latex and produced the neat PDF was very satisfying to be sure, I have always been more of a pencil and paper teacher handwriting and copying problem sets, it was nice doing the clean typesetting

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful shift in your workflow. On the flip side, have you encountered any particularly frustrating moments when working with AI? What was going on during those times?

User: There has definitely been frustration where I could not get the formatting or sequencing correct, but it was never too big a deal to correct or do myself...

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My skills are my ideas that are formed from my unique experience and perspective and no one can take that, so no I don't really consider that

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Continuously where we are working together in a capacity where there might be even more of an observational role in both directions with AI and humans checking each over making sure for accuracy- it could be a human supervisor with a bank of AI tutors and vice versa. I think in the end there will be more AI 'colleagues', bosses, admin, what have you integrated with humans in much the way we are doing now

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a peer review system and your view that your unique experience and ideas are what make you irreplaceable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Students want more than anything to be heard and made to feel like their ideas are worthwhile. Listen compassionately, answer honestly, maintain consistent emotional regularity, while respecting and maintaining healthy boundaries and your students will admire, respect, and want to continue to work with you and trust you.

AI: Thank you for sharing that - it really captures something essential about the human element in education that goes beyond just delivering content or solving problems.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the fluid, intuitive way you collaborate with AI, your perspective on building peer review into AI workflows, and especially that final point about what students truly need will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
