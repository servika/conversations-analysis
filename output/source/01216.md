Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That is good. Lets begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One recent project was focussed upon tidal stream development within the Fall of Warness Orkney. The initial project start was locating a problem area, this involved a large background literature review. We then looked at what data we had and how we could calibrate a 2D FE model with this data for modelling. We then needed to ask what questions we wanted answered and how we would answer them - i.e what data needed to come out of the model. This was followed by data analysis and writing of the report. 

Let me know if there are areas you want more detail in

AI: That's a great overview - I can see you had a very structured approach from literature review through to final reporting. 

I'd love to hear more detail about the literature review stage you mentioned at the beginning. What did that process actually look like for you day-to-day? How did you go about finding and working through the relevant research?

User: There was a handful of papers adjacent to the field and some related to a new innovative optimisation scheme we wished to use. I started there and then looked at the papers that were referenced within. Often finding useful material was challenging on google scholar. A lot of the research was reading and using mendeley to store and take notes on relevant papers

AI: That sounds like a pretty time-intensive process - especially when you mentioned that finding useful material was challenging on Google Scholar. It sounds like you were doing a lot of manual digging through reference lists.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I looked to use AI to find papers that would answer questions I had, however the results of this were very poor and often more of a hinderance than a help. I did however start using AI to summarise papers instead of directly finding them to speed up the decision of whether it was worth me reading the whole thing.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI was much more helpful for you as a screening tool than as a discovery tool. 

Tell me more about using AI to summarize papers. How did that work in practice - were you feeding it the full papers, abstracts, or something else? And what made you decide to try that approach?

User: I fed it the paper as a whole as a pdf. Often I knew roughly what I wanted out of it so asked for it to summarise findings related to a small area - i.e "Summarise the findings in this paper that discuss 2D versus 3D models" in a paper that looks at modelling techniques. I started trying this method after reading papers that often had no value, and I thought I could skim through a greater number this way, wasting less time. I often still took recommendations from the references of these papers

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a filter to help you prioritize where to spend your reading time more effectively. It sounds like you developed a pretty specific approach with targeted questions rather than just asking for general summaries.

For that summarization task, tell me about how you decided whether to trust what the AI was telling you versus going back to read those sections yourself.

User: I often didn't. If the AI said there was nothing of use I moved on quickly. But if it said there was useful items I they went and read it myself. I then often used it for paraphrasing direct sections that I would paste in, but in that scenario I knew it existed and was accuaret from having read it

AI: That's a smart verification approach - using AI as a preliminary filter but always confirming anything valuable yourself. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research workflow - the data analysis, the 2D FE modeling, or the report writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I used AI a lot in the data processing, FE creation, and data analysis. It was almost exclusively using Python so as long as I knew the framework and data structures of what was going in and what I wanted the process to do, AI was helpful in writing the code. I also used AI to help me understand legacy code from other members of my department

AI: That's fascinating - so AI was actually quite integrated into multiple stages of your workflow, especially the technical implementation side. 

When you were using AI to write Python code for your data processing and analysis, how did you go about verifying that the code it generated was doing what you actually needed it to do?

User: I often had smaller sub sets of data that were of a size a human could parse them. I then ran test cases to ensure the output was correct. I also manually implemented print and check statements to flag irregularities. I also had old data from past projects that I could check with the new code to ensure the outputs remain unchanged where possible

AI: That's a really thorough testing approach - using multiple validation methods to build confidence in the AI-generated code. We're about halfway through our conversation now, and I'm getting a great picture of how you've integrated AI across different parts of your research process.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't help with effectively, what would that be and why?

User: It would definitely be in the locating of sources and reading material. This is the one area AI failed when I tried it

AI: That's really striking - given how much time you spent manually searching through Google Scholar and following reference trails, it sounds like better AI-powered literature discovery could have a huge impact on your efficiency.

What specifically went wrong when you tried using AI for finding sources? Was it giving you irrelevant papers, non-existent citations, or something else entirely?

User: It was giving papers that were either irrelevant, answer questions that I didnt need answered, or just made up papers entirely

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI worked well as a code-writing and summarization tool but completely failed for literature discovery were particularly insightful. It's interesting how you developed such a methodical verification approach for the areas where AI was helpful.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the stark contrast between AI's reliability for technical tasks versus literature search really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: I believe that is all I have to offer for this. Thank you

AI: Perfect, thank you so much for your time and insights today. Your experiences really paint a clear picture of where AI is genuinely helpful in research workflows and where it still has significant limitations. This has been incredibly valuable for our understanding.

Have a great rest of your day!
