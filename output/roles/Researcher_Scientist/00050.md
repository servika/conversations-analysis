Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, that sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently worked on a physiology research project that aimed to further the connection between sympathetic arousal and exercise performance. First, a research question was proposed and relevant literature was reviewed to determine the current gaps in knowledge. Next, I started with experimental design, where I constructed a series of experiments that induced sympathetic arousal in our study participants while measuring an objective metric of sympathetic arousal (heart rate, blood pressure etc.), while testing their performance on a basic strength-based exercise. Finally, I recorded the results, applied statistical analysis, and finalized a research paper with my findings

AI: That's a really comprehensive project - from literature review all the way through to publication. It sounds like you had multiple distinct phases there: the initial research and gap analysis, then the experimental design, data collection, statistical analysis, and finally writing up the results.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools to help me analyze the literature during review. I also used AI tools when I was trying to determine the best statistical analysis to apply to my specific datasets.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for the literature analysis - what did that look like in practice?

User: I would copy and paste specific parts of the literature into an AI tool, and ask the tool to either analyze the significance of the research or to help me fill a gap in the current literature with a novel research question.

AI: That's interesting. For that specific task - analyzing literature and identifying research gaps - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of reading through papers yourself.

User: I did both. For some papers that were highly complicated or too long for me to read through, I relied on using AI to save time.

AI: That makes sense - using it as a time-saver for the more complex or lengthy papers. When you did use AI to analyze those complicated papers, how did you verify or validate what it produced? How did you make sure its analysis was accurate?

User: I would conduct follow up research, cross check its analysis with other researchers and online information, in addition to relying on my proficiency with the science to determine if its analysis was sound.

AI: That's a thorough verification process. We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. 

Looking at the other parts of your research process - the experimental design, data collection, and paper writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I simply have not learned how to use/prompt AI in those specific parts of the process. I'm eager to try. With paper writing specifically, Ive avoided using AI because I wanted my own insights and findings to be communicated.

AI: That's really insightful - so it sounds like for some areas it's about not knowing how to effectively apply AI yet, but for the paper writing there's a more intentional choice to maintain your own voice and insights.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Statistical analysis and data collection. This is an extremely time-consuming and tedious process that wastes lots of human time.

AI: That's a great point about the time-consuming nature of those tasks. We're nearing the end of our conversation now.

Those are all my main questions - your perspectives on using AI selectively based on complexity and time constraints, while being thoughtful about verification and maintaining your own voice in writing, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI for literature analysis while maintaining rigorous verification processes, and your thoughtful approach to preserving your own voice in scientific writing, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
