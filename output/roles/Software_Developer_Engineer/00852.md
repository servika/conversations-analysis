Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use AI for two main areas as of now.  The first main area is coding, whether it be how to solve a certain problem or finding a bug in code.  The other area is in writing, such as rewriting something to sound more professional.

AI: That's helpful context. When you're using AI for coding - whether it's problem-solving or debugging - can you walk me through what that typically looks like? Do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI, or do you usually get what you need in one interaction?

User: I usually ask the AI a question and get some resulting code suggestions.  I usually go back and forth with the AI, as sometimes the AI writes code that doesn't do exactly what is desired.

AI: That back-and-forth process sounds quite collaborative. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Since I know that AI is not perfect (and neither am I), I have to be skeptical about the output and double check it.  Many times there are tasks that I am certain of, so I don't want AI involved.

AI: That makes sense - you're being strategic about when to bring AI in versus when to rely on your own expertise. 

Can you give me an example of a task where you're certain enough that you prefer to handle it yourself, even though AI could potentially assist?

User: Yes, when working with databases and potential updates to important data, I prefer to handle those myself, working with a co-worker to analyze any potential issues.

AI: That's a great example - databases and data updates certainly carry high stakes. It sounds like for those critical tasks, you prefer the human collaboration with your co-worker over AI assistance.

Speaking of your workplace, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: AI is now incorporated into our e-mail programs, as well as an external chat option.  I know my colleagues occasionally use AI to perform certain tasks, or to check on code they have written, or need coding suggestions.  Due to that influence, I now think about how AI can help more often that AI is going more mainstream.

AI: It sounds like having AI built right into your tools and seeing colleagues use it has made it feel more natural and accessible. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI at work has made me feel particularly satisfied in that it can help me write more professional sounding paragraphs for my annual performance review.  It can take ideas that I have and present them in a great way.

AI: That's a really interesting use case - having AI help translate your ideas into polished, professional language for something as important as a performance review. It sounds like AI is acting as a kind of writing partner there.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that AI is a tool.  All AIs I have used or seen all readily admit they can "make mistakes" so human involvement is very important to keep AI in check to make sure the output is correct and desired.

AI: That perspective of AI as a tool that requires human oversight is really thoughtful. You clearly see the human role as essential for quality control and validation.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think AI will be more commonly built into tools and applications on a daily basis.  People will get more used to using it because it will become more commonplace.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI as a tool that requires human oversight and your strategic approach to when you choose to involve AI versus handle tasks yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool for coding and writing, while maintaining human judgment for critical tasks like database work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
