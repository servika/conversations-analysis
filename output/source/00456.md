Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm happy to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use it that much at the moment because I'm unsure of how best to utilise AI in my work but I've been branching out recently. I've asked AI to condense/rewrite emails, I've also asked for advice on which type of software is the best to use for a specific task (e.g. microsoft lists or excel) or how to do something in a programme. I've also used it to automate tasks for me or suggest ways to improve template files that I use

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you're in an exploratory phase with AI. You mentioned being unsure of how best to utilize AI in your work. 

Can you tell me more about what makes you feel uncertain? What goes through your mind when you're deciding whether or not to use AI for something?

User: Sometimes I worry about the accuracy of the output, I think if I have to spend time checking what the AI has produced then it might not save me much time overall. Or it isn't an easy problem to explain and I'm not really sure what I'm asking and it might be a waste of time if I can't explain the problem in such a way that the AI is able to assist

AI: That's a really insightful perspective. It sounds like there's this calculation you're doing between the time investment of explaining the problem versus the potential time savings.

When you have used AI successfully - like for condensing emails or getting software recommendations - what made those interactions work well for you? What was different about those situations?

User: The problems were more straightforward and I knew exactly what I was asking for in those situations

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having clarity about what you want seems to be key for you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anything that requires a high level of accuracy I'd prefer to do myself, or at least in part myself

AI: That's interesting - accuracy being the deciding factor for you. 

Can you give me an example of a task that falls into that category? Something where you think "I need to handle this myself because accuracy is too important"?

User: Proof reading a document or cross referencing spreadsheets to make sure everyone on one list is included in a different list or has the right data associated with them

AI: That's really helpful - those are tasks where getting it wrong could have real consequences.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends on the task, if I want advice for how to do something I'll explain my problem and then ask follow up questions/give my own ideas to refine the responses to the ideal solution. If I want a task automated, e.g. I want data extracted from a spreadsheet and put into a word document in a specific format then I would delegate that completely

AI: That's a really clear distinction - collaboration for advice and guidance, delegation for more mechanical tasks. 

You mentioned automating data extraction as something you'd delegate completely. When you do delegate a task like that, how do you feel about the handoff? Do you find yourself wanting to check the work, or are you comfortable trusting the output?

User: I do find myself checking it

AI: So even with the tasks you delegate completely, you're still doing that accuracy check we talked about earlier.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it more something you're figuring out on your own?

User: People seem to either not want to use AI at all or they use it for absolutely everything, even in situations where I can't really see the point

AI: That's a fascinating observation - it sounds like you're somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. 

Can you give me an example of a situation where you've seen someone use AI and thought "I can't really see the point"? What was it about that use case that struck you that way?

User: People use it for finding an alternative to a word in a context where good writing isn't really essential, e.g. a column header for a table

AI: That's a really specific example - it sounds like you see AI as overkill for simple word choices when the stakes are low.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I asked for suggestions for how to improve a spreadsheet that I use for a particular project every year, I received some good suggestions and was asked if I wanted to be provided with a new copy of the spreadsheet with these changes incorporated and I said yes, but the file was the same as the one I uploaded. When I pointed this out the new file only had some of the changes. I went back and forth a few times before being told the changes couldn't be made and instead I was given instructions for how to make them myself

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially that back and forth where you kept getting incomplete results and then ultimately had to do it yourself anyway. 

What made that experience particularly frustrating for you? Was it more about the time wasted, or something else about how that interaction unfolded?

User: It was mostly the time wasted, but also being told something had been done when it hadn't

AI: That trust issue - being told something was completed when it wasn't - that seems like it would really undermine confidence in the tool.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it's very important. I think over the next few years people who don't want to/can't use AI in their work are going to get squeezed out of certain workplaces, because people who can successfully use AI will be able to automate a lot of their work, freeing up their time for higher level work and creative thinking so they will be the high flyers

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're seeing AI as creating two tiers of workers based on how well they can leverage these tools.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What do you think will change for you personally?

User: I want to be more confident using it so that I can be more productive at work. I know there are tasks I do that could be faster and more efficient if I just take the time to learn how to change them and asking AI is quicker than seeking that information out elsewhere

AI: That desire for confidence really comes through - it sounds like you see the potential but want to get better at knowing when and how to engage with it effectively.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being in that middle ground between colleagues who avoid AI entirely and those who use it for everything - that nuanced view of when it's worth using versus when it might be overkill.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Something that might be relevant is that my organisation has an AI policy which restricts which models we're allowed to use for work purposes because of data protection and encryption, so that limits what we can use

AI: That's really valuable context - so there's this additional layer of organizational constraints on top of your personal decision-making about when to use AI. That policy dimension could definitely shape how people explore and adopt these tools at work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating that balance between potential efficiency gains and accuracy concerns, along with the organizational policy considerations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
