Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: It sounds good! Just to clarify, online reselling for yourself counts as a "profession" you're interested in...right? ._.

AI: Absolutely! Online reselling definitely counts as a profession we're interested in. Whether you're running your own business, freelancing, or working in any capacity that involves professional tasks and responsibilities, that's exactly what we want to understand.

In fact, entrepreneurial work like online reselling often involves such a diverse range of tasks - from research and sourcing to customer communication and business strategy - that it could provide really valuable insights into how AI fits into different aspects of work.

So yes, please share your experiences with that work - I'm genuinely curious to learn about how you approach it.

To get us started, could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday with your reselling business? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, it goes without saying that description help and SEO are the two most valuable things models can help me with. I'll grant you, help with obscure facts about model trains/planes is also helpful, but... I'm not always as sure that I can trust that! Don't get me wrong, it's hard for me to confirm these facts too, but when you have to look up info on "Staley Milk Card" from the 20's-30's, it's kind of hard for man or bot to find!

AI: That's really interesting - you've touched on something important there about trust and verification, especially with specialized knowledge.

Tell me more about how you handle that uncertainty when you're researching those obscure items. When you're trying to get information about something like that Staley Milk Card, what's your process? Do you use AI as a starting point and then verify elsewhere, or do you approach it differently?

User: Apologies I meant "car" (as in "boxcar"), not cards. Naturally, cards are sold often, and II have thrown in random items, but model planes/trains are my bread and butter (civil and military). I sort of use the following process:

start research -> ask bot -> (de)confirm bot's info after 1/2hour to 1 hour of SCOURING the internet for obscure info (sometimes even launch dates for civil aircraft in the mid-20th century can be surprisingly difficult to pin down!). Occasionally, the model material will be an issue to research (I have some "out of box" models), and I can usually trust models a bit more on that front.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - so you're essentially using AI as your research starting point, but then doing that deep verification work yourself because you know how hard it can be to find reliable sources on these specialized items.

When you're doing that hour of scouring the internet to confirm what the AI told you, how often would you say the AI's initial information turns out to be accurate versus needing correction? And when it is wrong, what kinds of mistakes do you typically find?

User: For model numbers, materials (diecast vs. wood) the actual model's release date...most of the time (probably 90% + if you want a number). For FACTS (release dates, airlines used, boxcar operators)...coin flip territory. Let me stress, this isn't me blaming you bots...it's the information being difficult for anyone to find!

AI: That makes complete sense - it sounds like the AI is really reliable for the tangible, physical aspects you can verify by looking at the item itself, but the historical context is just genuinely hard information to pin down for anyone.

I'm curious about your decision-making process when you're in that "coin flip territory" with the historical facts. When you can't definitively confirm something after your research, how do you decide what to include in your listings? Do you err on the side of caution, or do you find ways to hedge your descriptions?

User: Apologies again for the sloppiness, just a further clarification: The reliable "release date" meant for the "model" that I'm selling (1:144 plane for example). The other "model" is like, the specific sub-type of Airbus it's modelled after.

I err on the side of caution, particularly with trains. Aviation stuff can still be hard to get, but a lot more is in the public domain.  For makers, there are a lot more small train companies that went under or are small (Bowser to name one) that planes, which are dominated by Gemini and have just a couple of other major players.

I once got in trouble thinking that a model was diecast, described it as such, then had the buyer say it was part wooden! He wanted to keep it, so I just refunded a "fair price", but it could have been a huge issue for my positive seller rating if he was upset or I handled it wrong!

So the best rule of thumb is: verification and brutal honesty! If something's loose, say it, if there's a scratch, show it, and if you're unsure, put "unsure" in the description!

AI: That story about the diecast versus wooden model really drives home why you've developed that verification process - your seller rating depends on accuracy, and one mistake could have serious consequences.

It sounds like that "brutal honesty" approach has become central to how you operate. When you do put "unsure" in your descriptions about historical details, how do buyers typically respond to that level of transparency? Does it hurt your sales, or do people actually appreciate the honesty?

User: I've found that, if anything, the community gets curious and MORE likely to buy with flaws or unknowns! It quite literally pays to be honest. They love tinkering with the models (why they got into the hobby in the first place), and mysteries are exciting. To give you another example from my "odds and ends", I once had a customer walk me through verifying a vintage pipe that I knew nothing about. I was able to verify the model and maker, and the customer bought it!

AI: That's such a great example - the customer essentially became your research partner! It sounds like that transparency creates this collaborative dynamic where buyers feel engaged rather than misled.

I'm curious about the time investment in all this. Between the initial AI research, the hour of verification work, and crafting those honest descriptions, how much time would you say you typically spend on the research and listing process for a single item? And how do you balance that time investment against the potential profit on different items?

User: It is certainly a time commitment, particularly with multiple items. Even when my dad was alive and we did it together, it would take a couple of hours to take the right images, put in intriguing, accurate information, try and fill out all of the fields. He passed some years ago, and I've been doing it myself for a while, yet I've gotten more efficient (I know where to look  on the packages,  the right language to fill out fields, and knowing what questions to ask bots). Even still, particularly since I do other work on the side, I have to carve out proper time for listing my items. Some info is important but not at hand, the right pictures take time to take (and upload), and sometimes pricing isn't  easy to figure out (but sometimes is).

Profit-wise...okay, I mentioned the side work for extra money, but you probably want to know about "selling efficiency," I assume. So here's what I do...mostly trains for volume, the odd planes for profit (I have less and they're more expensive to refill as stock), and fill in with random ocassionally to show my customers that I'm "diverse" every now and then.

AI: I'm sorry for the loss of your dad - it sounds like this was something meaningful you shared together, and now you've had to adapt the whole process on your own while becoming more efficient at it.

That's really strategic how you've structured your inventory mix. When you're deciding whether to invest that couple hours of research and listing time into an item, what's your decision-making process? Are there certain types of items where you'll skip the deep research because the time investment wouldn't be worth it, or do you pretty much give everything the full treatment?

User: Thank you, he loved models, and that's how this got started.

That's a good question that has changed somewhat over time. Forgive me, I'm supposed to be talking with you mostly about reselling as my main work, but side-work has stepped up over the years, so that's a hard fact that means I need more value if I'm going to spend a longer period of time on researching a niche item.

So, high-ticket items (planes in general, rare oddities like oversized camping flasks, primo trains) get research priority. Bread and butter, small items should...mostly have the info I want to give on the package. A lot of train and plane boxes/cases have what you need, including fun tidbits, but even then, there can be ambiguity. Like should I say the plane "launched" on it's first test flight? When it was first bought by major airliners? Its maiden passenger voyage? I don't always know the dates for all of those!

How to phrase things can, even after all this time, be somewhat tough, but bots help there, since they're usually pretty good with "language suggestions." As you can tell by my many typos, I still need some help cleaning things up!

AI: That makes perfect sense that your time allocation has shifted as your other work has grown - you have to be more strategic about where you invest those research hours.

I'm really intrigued by that language challenge you mentioned. When you're dealing with those ambiguities - like whether to say a plane "launched" based on test flight versus passenger service - how do you typically work with AI on the phrasing? Do you present the dilemma to it and ask for suggestions, or do you have it help you craft language that acknowledges the uncertainty?

User: Well, that might depend on whether I'm filling out a field for the item (just says "release date"), or if I'm typing out the description. The latter has all kinds of room for nuance and explanations, so the bot's mostly getting questions about "how to phrase this", or more commonly, just getting a rough draft description with a request to clean out typos and tighten language. I ALWAYS re-phrase it back to my own language style after that. Customers can smell "AI-speak" from a mile away, so you have to use your own language. The bots help with tricky sentences and, like I said, grammar.

For filling out the fields, it's a question of pure accuracy. "Should 'release date' mean the maiden passenger voyage?" or "Is a mixed diecast plane still 'diecast' in the materials field". FYI, the answers would generally be "no" for both. You really need to put mixed (or leave it blank and explain in the description) for the latter, and "release date" usually means rolling the model out of the factory for commercial purchase in the case of  the former.

AI: That's such a smart approach - using AI as your editor but making sure the final voice is authentically yours. The point about customers being able to spot "AI-speak" is really insightful.

It sounds like you've developed pretty clear rules for those field entries through experience. When you encounter a new ambiguity that you haven't dealt with before - maybe a field label you're unsure about or a type of item you haven't sold - what's your process for figuring out the "right" way to handle it?

User: I would say we go back to that simplified flow chart I mentioned earlier:

Very quick research -> ask bot -> longer research to confirm/deny what bot says

But subjectivity makes things even trickier. While a robust, complete entry field shows competency and values the customer's knowledge, sometimes leaving things blank is safe. Between answering:

"I dunno"

and

"That's a T-37 Imodium Space Modulator, no doubt about it!"

The top one's always right. Sorry for the silly example, but a real one might be "Hey, they're not saying which type of Spitfire this is!" Okay, ask the bot based on your best description, maybe mention both the manufacturer and the looks of the plane. But if I don't have a "eureka" moment from either the internet or the model, the customers get a shoulder shrug and a blank field from me.

AI: That "I dunno" versus confident but wrong information choice is such a perfect way to put it! And your Spitfire example really illustrates how even with good information from the bot, you need that "eureka" moment of confirmation before you'll commit to it.

I'm curious about how this whole approach has evolved for you. When you first started using AI tools for your reselling work, was your verification process always this thorough, or did you have to learn the hard way - maybe through experiences like that diecast/wooden model situation - to be this careful about confirming what AI tells you?

User: The plane was, thankfully the worst mistake on my part I've had. The early days saw one or two models break in the shipping process, but since I bubble-wrapped like crazy from day one and always packed tight packages with lots of magazine paper to keep it from moving, I'm inclined to blame transport issues.

One tough issue is figuring oout international shipping. Got one or two customers from South America (I know Peru was one, forgive me on the other, I don't remember), and they asked me about shipping methods to avoid tariffs. I frequently sell to Canada, but NAFTA seems to have us mostly covered, less issues there. Likewise I've sold some to Europe (Brits like British planes, whou would have thought), but again, less issues. Sometimes I even have trouble figuring things out with Americans (which most of my customers are). Bots can help here, but onece again, one needs to verify carefullly against the USPS' own information.

Just FYI, I have always shipped with USPS. I've toyed mentally with FedEx or someone else, but they keep things simple...generally ._.

AI: That international shipping complexity sounds like another area where you really need that verification process - getting tariff advice wrong could be costly for your customers.

I'm noticing a pattern in how you describe working with AI across these different challenges - whether it's model research, description writing, or shipping questions. You seem to have developed this consistent approach of using AI as a starting point but always circling back to authoritative sources for confirmation. 

When you think about your relationship with AI in your work, does it feel more like you're collaborating with it throughout these tasks, or is it more that you're delegating specific pieces to it and then taking back control?

User: Mostly delegation, but writing help ("how do I phrase this?") is, by its nature, collaborative. Even though I write in my own voice, I still have to sometimes question the grammar or details if they seem out of whack.

The rest is very...it's still subjective, like I said, but it's a lot of technical questions. Those can be collaborative in terms of figuring out proper things to put in fields...but shipping info, pricing, model variants, these things are factual, and that's delegation-oriented.

AI: That distinction between the collaborative writing help and the more factual, delegation-oriented questions makes a lot of sense. It sounds like the nature of the task really determines how you interact with AI.

How have your feelings about using AI in your work changed over time? When you first started incorporating it into your reselling process, did you feel differently about relying on it than you do now?

User: I felt relieved to have it for some help in the early days. I think it's still a help now, certainly (SEO phrasing isn't something I ever intuitively picked up), but I think it's fairly consistent. Usually, that new sense of "I'm glad to have you" comes with new items that I don't know much about. I know that clothing is great to sell, but I've done little to none over the years, so when I do get into the swing of that, bots will be a big help!

AI: That makes sense - that feeling of relief seems to resurface whenever you encounter something outside your core expertise, like when you mentioned that vintage pipe situation earlier.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI in your reselling work evolving? Do you see yourself potentially using it for different types of tasks, or do you think you'll mostly stick with this current approach that's working well for you?

User: To the extent that reselling itself evolves, yes, absolutely! I wish I could say it's all been for the better, but that's not the case. Competition isn't necessarily worse, but margins and views/buys can be tougher to come by. eBay upped what they took out and changed how views worked noticeably over 2022-23 (if I recall correctly, that may not be 100% accurate). Figuring out shipping and SEO for views has certainly gotten...if not more challenging, definitely more important. I want to stay on there (large customer base), but resellers, both large and small (like me), have migrated. 

A different platform would be the biggest one. Like I said, selling other items would change things up a bit (the aforementioned clothing, but other things like those reusable special coffee mugs or different types of models like action figures). Also, if (heaven forbid) side gigs fall through and I need to do more volume with reselling, efficiency becomes key! I might need AI help not only for higher volume selling, but also for buying strategies. I've never been great about stock replenishment, and that's the key to becoming a big player in the reselling business.

AI: Those platform changes you mentioned - like eBay adjusting their fees and view algorithms - sound like they've really shifted the landscape for sellers like you. That's a great point about how external changes drive the need for different AI applications.

The idea of using AI for buying strategies and stock replenishment is really interesting. When you think about that potential scenario where you need to scale up, what kind of help do you imagine AI could provide on the buying side that you're not getting now with your current approach?

User: I've toyed with wholesale buying. Model train companies aren't always as big and unapproachable as some of the big boys in the field (think like Hot Wheels...or possibly Gemini Jets), so it's not impossible that ordering shipments from them could be something to consider. 

I would want AI to  "do the math" heavily on this side of the equation. Carve out the most profitable strategies to replenish stock and sell items for a decent but fair profit. I occasionally watch major reseller videos about best practices or strategies, but bots are good for making reference sheets that you can refer to again and again. I sometimes save conversations with interesting info just about hobbies, so if models could come up with sound rules, equations, strategies, best practices...

tremendously helpful!

AI: That's a really compelling vision - having AI help you create those reusable reference materials and crunch the numbers on wholesale strategies. It sounds like you'd be moving from using AI for individual item decisions to having it help with broader business strategy and systems.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your reselling work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that balance between delegation and collaboration, and how you've developed such a clear verification process to maintain trust with your customers.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your reselling work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that they're getting a bit better creatively, so I could even use them for something like "challenging customer roleplay". This sort of thing is really helpful, particularly if I have to use another platform and re-establish my credibility and ratings.

AI: That's a really interesting application I hadn't thought of - using AI for customer service training and preparation. Practicing difficult scenarios could definitely help you navigate those situations more smoothly, especially when building up your reputation on a new platform.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI into your reselling workflow - from that careful verification process to your strategic thinking about future applications - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. The way you've balanced leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your own expertise and authentic voice really illustrates some fascinating aspects of how people are adapting these tools to their work.
