Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me — no questions from me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently, AI does not fit much into my typical workday. I utilize AI-powered tools such as Grammarly to provide editing suggestions when I'm writing, whether that be professional/administrative correspondence or personal creative writing projects, but beyond that I do not use AI platforms such as Chat GPT, Co-Pilot, Gemini, etc. for research or to create pieces of professional or creative writing from scratch.

AI: That's interesting that you've chosen to use AI selectively - mainly for editing support rather than content creation or research. 

What influences that choice for you? What makes you comfortable using Grammarly's AI suggestions but hesitant to use other AI platforms for those other tasks?

User: It's the extent to which AI is incorporated into my work. I find using AI as an aid really helpful, but I am hesitant to allow AI to perform tasks in their entirety for three reasons. 1) AI has proven unreliability in deep research tasks, such as hallucinations, miscontextualizing information, etc., and the need to substantiate claims made by AI means that I wouldn't save much more time than if I just conduct the research myself when necessary; 2) I don't want to be reliant on AI for basic tasks such as writing, as I don't want to lose my ability to do them myself; 3) While there are tasks I would like for AI to be able to take over, such as professional correspondence, I do enjoy the processes of research and writing, and I do like to do them myself.

AI: Those are really thoughtful distinctions you're making. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI enhances what you're already doing rather than replacing your involvement entirely.

Tell me more about that second point - not wanting to lose your ability to do basic tasks yourself. How do you think about maintaining those skills while still benefiting from AI assistance?

User: I feel that if one lets AI do a task for them entirely — i.e., writing, research, animation, content creation, etc. — their skills in doing that task themselves will atrophy, or at the very least they will not learn anything new themselves. For writing, an AI-powered tool like Grammarly allows me to see suggestions for how to improve my writing, where a sentence may be better structured or another word may be more suitable, and my own knowledge of grammar and vocabulary is increasing at the same time. I think the key to maintaining skills while benefitting from AI assistance is integration, not reliance.

AI: That distinction between integration and reliance really captures something important. You're describing AI as almost like a learning partner that shows you suggestions you can absorb, rather than just doing the work for you.

Can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? When you're using Grammarly, how do you actually interact with its suggestions?

User: I do! A weakness/bad habit in my writing that I was aware of before, but that I could never quite fix because I couldn't figure out where to begin, was that I've always tended to be a bit verbose. I've always tended to use four words where one would've sufficed. Grammarly's suggestions, which I often engage with, are often shorter, more direct versions of what I've written. Sometimes I intended for the longer, more profuse sentence as a stylistic decision, but often, especially in professional correspondence, this was unintended, an expression of my bad writing habits, and Grammarly's suggestions help me quickly fix it, whilst making me a stronger writer through exposure to alternatives and, most importantly, requiring me to choose whether or not to use those alternatives. Ultimately, I am still in control of the writing process, but I have an assistant who is bringing my attention to possible issues. Its spelling fixes are always helpful, but to me, this seems like an evolution of the 'spelling check' feature that already existed on most word processors.

AI: That's a perfect example of what you mean by integration versus reliance - you're actively choosing whether to accept suggestions and learning from that process. It sounds like Grammarly is helping you become more aware of patterns in your own writing that you wanted to change anyway.

When you do decide not to take one of Grammarly's suggestions, what usually drives that decision? What makes you say "no, I want to keep it the way I wrote it"?

User: This is far more common when I am writing creatively, as I think in that context, a writer's flaws can be distinct aspects of their style. Thinking of a far better writer than me, Jack Kerouac, his style is extremely flawed grammatically, with run-on sentences, incorrect punctuation, and misspellings. But these features are associated positively with his writing style, which is extremely innovative and iconic. If Grammarly saw a page of his work, it would have tons of corrections, because its goal is grammatical correctness and economy. So context largely determines whether or not I accept Grammarly's suggestions — I want my creative writing to be as much an expression of myself as possible, flaws and all. But even in professional correspondence or administrative writing tasks, Grammarly is not perfect. What may be technically correct doesn't always 'sound' or 'read' right — it can be a bit stilted — so I do make judgment calls to refuse its suggestions on the grounds of readability or common use.

AI: That's such a nuanced way of thinking about it - recognizing that grammatical "correctness" isn't always what serves your purpose, whether that's preserving your creative voice or just making professional writing sound natural.

You mentioned earlier that there are some tasks you would like AI to take over, like professional correspondence, but you also enjoy research and writing. How do you think about that tension - wanting efficiency in some areas but preserving the parts of work you find fulfilling?

User: I suppose this is very subjective, as what I find fulfilling and want to personally engage with versus what I find arduous and would be happy for AI to take over differs from what others would say. Generally speaking, a businessman may want to manage their finances and the development of their business endeavors personally, especially if it's their own organization and they have an emotional investment in it, whereas I, as an English teacher, couldn't care less about admin like that and instead would rather focus on research for lesson preparation or creative writing. I also think it would be doing students a disservice to use an AI to grade their work if they've written that work themselves, without those tools. And if they use an AI to write and I use an AI to grade, what's the point in assigning writing at all? I'm unsure how to resolve this tension, as it is so subjective.

AI: That's a really compelling point about the student-teacher dynamic - if both sides are using AI, it does raise fundamental questions about what the educational exchange is actually for.

As an English teacher, you're in an interesting position where you're probably seeing AI's impact from multiple angles. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you think about using AI in your work?

User: I know that some of my colleagues are utilizing AI tools far more than I, namely, prompting AI platforms to plan lessons. I also know that students are using it to complete assignments. The temptation is definitely there for me to do the same, as it would save time (even if I still have to substantiate an AI's claims, any time saved is still time saved), but I want to retain a personal connection to my students as much as possible. The exchange of knowledge should be as personalized as possible, in my opinion, and I wouldn't want to ask my students to put work in themselves if I'm not willing to do the same. There's definitely pressure to surrender more of my work to AI, especially with the benefit of saving time, but right now I enjoy the balance I have.

AI: That idea of modeling the kind of engagement you expect from your students is really interesting - there's an integrity to that approach.

You mentioned there's pressure to use AI more, especially for the time savings. Can you share a time when using AI at work - or choosing not to use it - made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't share a time where, personally, I felt particularly satisfied or frustrated at my decision to use or not use AI at work, but my partner had a distinct moment of frustration when they chose to use AI in their work. They are also an English teacher. Recently, they've started a private tutoring practice in order to add to their income, and in marketing this practice, they used two different AI models in order to create a poster. They crafted very detailed prompts about how they wanted the poster to look and what information it should convey, but no matter how the prompt was tweaked in subsequent exchanges, both models always got at least one thing wrong, whether that be formatting, inappropriate information (nonsensical or dishonest information), or graphic design. After about three hours, my partner was left with no usable poster, and they commented that the work would've actually gotten done faster had they just done it themselves. They were not particularly pressed for time, but they'd wanted to use AI to design the poster because they were not too familiar with how to do it themselves and didn't really want to learn, as they wouldn't use that skill much.

AI: That's such a vivid example of when the promise of AI efficiency doesn't match reality. It sounds like your partner hit that exact challenge you mentioned earlier - the time you'd need to spend verifying or fixing AI's work can sometimes exceed just doing it yourself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself maintaining this current balance, or do you think it might shift?

User: Ideally, I'd like to maintain the current balance that I have, and if I were in a position of influence, I'd definitely aim for innovations in AI that prioritize their roles as assistants rather than experts. I think that humans need to retain our ability to communicate verbally or in writing, find information ourselves, and be creative. In a philosophical sense, I think the exchange of information amongst ourselves binds us to one another, reflects a crucial sense of interdependence, and the human pursuit of knowledge, becoming an 'expert' in something, anything, is a primary source of meaning. I'm aware that this isn't really realistic, as others don't necessarily share my view, and technology always moves inextricably forward. I'm sure the world we live in now would feel like sheer magic to somebody at one of those old World's Fairs 100+ years ago, so I'm just going to proceed with further AI use cautiously, but not refuse to embrace it at all.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on integration versus reliance - that distinction really captures something important about different approaches to AI adoption.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I can't think of anything that wasn't covered. Thank you for these thought-provoking questions, and I hope that my answers are beneficial.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that balance between efficiency and personal engagement, especially in an educational context, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

Your thoughtful approach to preserving the human elements you find meaningful while still benefiting from AI assistance really illustrates some of the nuanced decisions people are making as these tools become more prevalent. 

I really appreciate you taking the time to participate in this interview.
