Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions, I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I run a production company that has a focus on music, books, video content, and games. Many of our projects cross over into any of these fields, or all of them. For example, I have an artist now who is out that has music videos, that are part of an interconnected world that connects to their music. All of these are connected to a mobile game we currently have in production for them. As a production house, we are able to work with our artists and content creators from end to end.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic and integrated approach to content creation. I can see how managing projects that span music, video, games, and books would create some fascinating creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: That depends on the project. I will use my artist as an example. I am a producer, so I create their music the old-fashioned way, on my motif. From there, I send them the track, they write the lyrics, record and mix (in 1 of 3 studios). This is where AI comes in. I get the music, and listen to it, to get a feel for what it is telling me. I then begin working with some keywords and thoughts, creating a draft of the cover via AI. I draft my covers by AI usually. Once I have an idea of what I want, I then do the rest on my own. Back in the day, I would send this to a graphic designer, but with AI I am able to do this more efficiently on my own. From there, if the song is noteworthy, I will then work on a music video. With AI, this has become a 100 times more easier. I think of the theme, the style, and I do a mixture of AI and edits. It allows me to expand the reach of my production house, because sometimes we have 3-4 releases a week.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI is helping you handle the volume and pace of releases while maintaining creative control. You mentioned creating cover drafts with AI and then finishing them yourself, and mixing AI with edits for music videos.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Now I'm not going to disclose the name of the project, but we will call it "Project A". I received four completed songs from my artist, all with a dark, sort of Gotham city feel to them. Their lyrics are tight, the mixing is creative. I then sit with the music and get a picture in my mind of what I want. From there, I boot up Designer and create some ideas for the cover using AI. After a few revisions I have the core image I want. I then move it to the next level in Designer where I am able to edit the image directly, and add the different things a release needs on the cover (like title, etc.,). After ensuring the color and placements are right, I then press it. From there I send it to the distributor for review. This is a recent example of when I used it.

AI: That's a great example - I can really see how you're using AI as a starting point to capture that initial vision, then taking creative control to refine and finalize it. It sounds like you have a clear workflow from the music inspiring the visual concept, to AI helping you draft that concept, to you adding the professional finishing touches.

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am definitely driving it. I know what I want, and how it should look. So when I design prompts, I make sure they describe the style, the items/objects, placements, camera directions, etc. I am in the drivers seat. I have an urge to create, and being able to create with AI first allows me to see the vision quickly. Back in the day, you could sketch multiple designs you'd never use, and at the end of the day you lost a lot of time. With AI, I can create multiple drafts rather quickly, especially when it comes to cover designs and artwork. A person can make a high quality music video now with nothing more than an idea. This is profound.

AI: That's a powerful way to put it - you're clearly the creative director orchestrating the vision. It sounds like AI has transformed your ability to rapidly iterate and test ideas without losing time on concepts that don't work.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I am able to create more content in a shorter window of time. My artist produce songs quickly, and sometimes in bulk. We drop multiple singles a week, and sometimes a couple of EPs a month. They have different styles, and personalities. Back in the day, I was constrained by financial decisions, and the people I had to hire. Now, I have significantly cut down the need for external contractors in the process. The process used to require a lot more planning, but with AI, you can plan while you create. Instead of getting boxed into a corner, you are able to create multiple directions at the same time. While I am working on an artists cover I am also working on code for their mobile app. It helps me to do more.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has fundamentally changed your business model by removing both financial and logistical bottlenecks. The ability to work on multiple directions simultaneously while planning and creating at the same time sounds like it's opened up entirely new possibilities for how you structure projects.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am an early adopter, meaning I have used AI before it became cool to. As a coder, I have a different perspective then some creatives. I'm all for it. I'm an artist who sees it as another tool in my toolset. I've never complained when I used Photoshop, and I remember people actually did when people started drawing with computers (I am actually a Gimp user now). We use tools like Blender to assist us with design decisions all the time. I don't have any concerns other than it is moving too slow.

AI: That's such an interesting perspective - viewing AI as part of the natural evolution of creative tools, just like the transition from traditional methods to digital tools. Your background in coding clearly shapes how you see AI as just another instrument in your creative arsenal.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see AI becoming more integrated into the tool itself. Very similar to how its being integrated into vehicles, it will just be there. Also, there will be more consistency in the design of it. For example, when I create images, I will have consistent characters (like a character profile), and I can use these characters in my images or movies. As it becomes more common place, the cost of some of the tools will drop too.

AI: That vision of seamless integration and character consistency sounds like it would be a game-changer for your interconnected projects - especially with those music videos and games that exist in shared worlds.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the creative driver while using AI as a rapid ideation tool, and how that's transformed your production capacity and business model.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all I have.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as an evolution of creative tools, the way it's enabled you to scale your production house, and your perspective as someone who's been using AI since the early days will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared your workflow and the practical ways AI has transformed your business. Have a great rest of your day!
