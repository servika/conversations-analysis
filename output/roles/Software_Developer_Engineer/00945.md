Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! Let's begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Yea, I typically use AI for doing code completions or scaffolding code. I primarily work as a data engineer, but I mostly use AI coding assistants (GitHub copilot) to help me scaffold out code and perform data analysis. I also use my companies boilerplate AWS Bedrock chatbot for things like basic research tasks or for writing emails.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using these AI tools for coding and data analysis, tell me more about what "scaffolding code" looks like for you in practice.

User: Yea, I use it to scaffold AWS CDK or SAM code very frequently. I find that this kind of code is quite cumbersome to start off as there are a lot of dependencies and proper ways to start developing this kind of code.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - dealing with all those dependencies and configurations can be quite tedious. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I would say almost every task I would like help with especially when building code, but the level of AI use varies per task. For example, if I'm doing EDA on a dataset I prefer to use LLMs to bounce ideas off, but I wouldn't just tell it to "perform EDA". I need to give it certain directions of anomalies or kinds of visuals/figures that I would want to see. Something like writing an email I would basically give it free reign, accompanying it with a tone I want the email with.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making between bouncing ideas off AI versus giving it free reign. It sounds like with EDA, you're staying more in the driver's seat and using AI as a thought partner.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: When building code personally, I use tools like Kilo Code or Claude Code and they are excellent for delegating complete tasks to. They have clear to-do lists and are very good at implementing testing and creating thorough solutions. However, my work is very restrictive with the use of AI tools and we are limited to our proprietary AWS Bedrock chatbot reskin and GitHub copilot. I've noticed copilot tends to lose track of its task and will often go off the rails when it gets unexpected results. So at work, I would definitely say we work hand in hand where i'm hovering closely over it and giving it very specific instructions.

AI: That's a fascinating contrast between your personal and work experiences. It sounds like the restrictions at work really shape how you can interact with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I would say this has definitely changed quite a bit during my brief term at the company. I've only been working there since [REDACTED] and our organization has been approving tools like GitHub Copilot as well as implementing a course for teaching all employees how to use AI effectively. I would definitely say that I'm pretty pro LLM use so I think I have probably effected my coworkers more in towards the use of AI rather than my company promoting the use.

AI: It's interesting that you see yourself as more of an influencer toward AI adoption rather than being influenced by others. Since you mentioned you're pretty pro-LLM, it sounds like you came into the role already enthusiastic about these tools.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would say I had a couple times where AI definitely had me feeling pretty frustrated. I believe I was writing queries for DB2 sql and I was using our internal chatbot through AWS, I'm not sure what model it is, as my work has been pretty secretive about the actual details of the model. The model was very bad about knowing the proper syntax for DB2. IT would often use keywords that were not available for db2 sql and of course it wouldn't run. It was also very poor at writing/rewriting queries even when given very specific instructions like table names, specific columns, etc.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you're providing specific details like table names and columns but still getting unusable output. The DB2 syntax issues must have made it feel like the AI was creating more work rather than helping.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I mean for sure. As these models get more competent I think most of these like little syntax issues get resolved so most of my contributions would be effective prompting and being able to understand the code.

AI: That's a practical perspective - focusing on the prompting and code comprehension skills that remain valuable as the models improve.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I definitely see AI moving towards being a sort of Junior software engineer, where it can be delegated specific tasks and as long as its given clear instructions and prompted correctly, it can be used very efficiently. I think if I was able to use more modern tools I would be able to use it like that.

AI: That "Junior software engineer" analogy is really compelling - especially with the emphasis on clear instructions and proper prompting being key to effective delegation.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the tools and restrictions at work versus personal use create such different interaction patterns, and that distinction between collaboration and delegation depending on the task and available tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the differences between personal and work AI tools, the evolution of workplace AI adoption, and that vision of AI as a junior developer have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
