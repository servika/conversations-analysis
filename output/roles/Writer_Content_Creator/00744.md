Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope! Ask away!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as an unscripted TV producer, and I do a lot of development. That is, I develop TV series ideas (think of documentary or factual or reality style programming) for an international audience.

I use AI mostly for research and as an aid while I'm writing. I've never used AI for help coming up with an original idea, but I've definitely "brain stormed" with AI and used it to come up with example episode (i.e. a series about the history of cities near the river - "brainstorm some possible cities).

In terms of writing, I'll often use it to summarize or to make a lot of copy/paste text fit a specific format. I may give the log line of a series to AI and ask it to write a longer synopsis, alongside an example from another program (I like it to try and match my style of writing). I rarely use these longer chunks of text wholesale, but there's often some good lines/ideas that I may incorporate.

During heavy development periods, I may use this daily. For the most part I am only using AI a couple times a week.

AI: That's fascinating - you've found some really specific ways to integrate AI into the development process. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you've never used AI for help coming up with original ideas, but you do use it for brainstorming examples. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Idea generation I prefer to do myself. I am more happy with the results when I do it this way. While I'm working in development, I'm coming up with ideas within a very narrow frame work (i.e. budget level, available talent, specific audiences/broadcasters), and it is just to difficult to try and make an AI "understand" all of these hyper-specific contexts.

I mostly do all my own writing. I find AI generated writing to be too broad and often flowery/over-the-top -- basically lacking substance. I've been a writer my whole life, so I'm snobbish about this.

Most of what I do is actually story editing and story producing, which I don't use AI for at all. This involves planning shoots and writing beat sheets, plus watching assemblies/rough cuts and giving notes. I cannot even imagine how I would integrate AI into this process.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're clearly very intentional about where AI adds value versus where your expertise and judgment are irreplaceable.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Yes, it's 100% collaborative. The degree to which I "delegate" depends upon the nature of the work. For instance, I recently had to complete a marketing plan for a funding application. For that project, I'd say it was about 70% AI generated writing, based on my prompts and other documentation I provide (i.e. a sample marketing plan for another production, materials previously generated detailing nature of the series). For something that is higher stakes to me, like writing a pitch that may possibly land a TV series deal for my company, it's more like 20-25% AI assisted writing/research - if I use it at all.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - how the stakes of the project influence your collaboration level with AI. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My boss is pretty open to me using AI and I have admitted to using it. I work for a small company and the owner is very much of the "entrepreneurial" mindset that if it saves time, it saves money. That said, I work in the "arts" technically, so there is a lot of resistance to generative AI use. 

I would definitely say I am an early adopter amongst my peers. Many of them have discounted it completely.

AI: It sounds like you're navigating some interesting tensions - having supportive leadership while working in an industry that's more skeptical of AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've had AI hallucinate events in history while researching TV shows, which was frustrating. My most satisfying experiences have been when I can give a list of 4-5 examples of things I've researched (episode ideas most often) and AI can write the short blurbs that detail these things. I've done this on several occasions and it saves a lot of time.

Another satisfying experience I haven't noted yet... I do some video editing as part of my job and need to frequent work in NLE software to view footage. But I'm not a proper video editor. So I routine ask AI to help me troubleshoot either issues I encounter, or more efficient ways to get what I need done done.

AI: Those examples really highlight both the risks and benefits - the hallucination issue is a great reminder of where verification is crucial, while the time-saving on routine writing tasks and technical troubleshooting sounds incredibly valuable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think AI will advance to the point where it can do what I do. I've heard some concerning studies about the impact of AI on peoples ability to write, and that's made me feel like I want to use AI less to write (being a good writer is my most important professional skill). But no, I don't really consider AI a threat to my skill development.

AI: That confidence in the irreplaceable nature of your core work makes sense given what you've described about the story editing and contextual decision-making you do.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope in the future that AI will be more integrated into the software (like the editing softwares I mentioned) I use for my job, so there's less of a burden to entry. Similarly, AI-enabled camers and sound recorders could elevate the quality of footage we can capture in the field, and hopefully streamline the technical process from production through post. 

In terms of generative AI, I am intrigued by the possibilities of using it for things like b-roll in a documentary (as an example). This is already being done to some extent, but of course there is a backlash. I suspect that within my career (I'm 37) this will all become fairly routine.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you calibrate your AI usage based on the stakes of different projects - that 70% versus 20-25% distinction was really illuminating.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope. Hope this helps.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically integrate AI into TV production while maintaining creative control have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've found that sweet spot of collaboration - using AI where it genuinely saves time and enhances your work, while preserving the core creative and editorial judgment that defines your expertise. Thanks again!
