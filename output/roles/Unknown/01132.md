Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's start with your first question.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write short fiction stories. The genre varies; Sci-Fi and Fantasy are favorites of mine, but I write in other genres too. It starts with brainstorming, and when I find an interesting idea or concept to try I start researching the topics that might be relevant. I plan an overall arc for the story to follow with some specific events or scenes to keep my later drafts organized. I typically make edits on the fly, but usually make several edits/refinements throughout the process. Once I think I'm happy with how the project is turning out I'll usually take some time away from it before returning to see if I'm still happy with it. Afterwards I upload the story to an appropriate public site if I'm just writing it for fun, or send it to the person who commissioned it in that case.

AI: That's a really detailed process - I can see how you've developed a structured approach from concept to publication. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I do try to limit my use of AI, so it's my voice and writing style and not someone else's. Sometimes I use AI while editing, to make sure what I've written makes sense and flows in a coherent manner, as well as double-check my grammar and spelling. I also sometimes use it for brainstorming, a change in perspective can really help to come up with interesting ideas. I prefer to do my own research for now, however, sometimes Google's AI Overview has links to pages that are useful, but I usually disregard the actual content of that overview and just check the cited webpages instead.

AI: That's interesting - you're being very intentional about maintaining your own voice while selectively using AI for specific functions. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I recently was writing in Microsoft Word, which has integrated AI. It automatically highlights what has been written and prepares suggestions. In the case of grammar or spelling mistakes it is very useful, but sometimes it prepares suggestions that go beyond that. In this particular case it suggested I change some words to make the sentence easier to read when I had written it to emphasize a specific word in that sentence. The suggestion was technically right, it would be easier to read if I followed its advice, but it would have also defeated the whole point of writing the sentence to begin with. I didn't want to see anymore AI suggestions for the rest of the day because I kept thinking that if everyone used these kinds of suggestions to "improve" their writing, everyone's style would be the same. No one would have a unique writing style anymore. I suppose the experience made me feel conflicted. AI can be very useful for small corrections, but when it is forced into software it's invasive, encouraging over-reliance on the model's functions.

AI: That's a really powerful example - the tension between technical correctness and creative intent. It sounds like that moment crystallized some concerns for you about how AI integration can push writers toward homogenization.

When you do choose to work with AI - like during your deliberate brainstorming sessions - how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The answer to that question varies. Sometimes I have a specific idea I want to explore, and sometimes even a planned method for that exploration, in which case I'm driving the creative decisions. Sometimes I let the model decide the direction the conversation goes for awhile. In these cases I don't ever take the ideas suggested, but let them act as a guide to slingshot my mind to an adjacent idea. I think the different perspective provided really helps with that. I think the collaboration during these brainstorming sessions works as well as it does because I get to decide how much control I have at any one time.

AI: That's fascinating - you've found a way to use AI as a creative catalyst while maintaining control over when and how much influence it has. The idea of using AI suggestions as a "slingshot" to adjacent ideas is really compelling.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The brainstorming sessions I think have changed the most. If I was totally blocked I'd stop and do something else to wait for inspiration to strike. I didn't get as much work done when that happened. Now, when I can't find something interesting to write, I can use AI to help a bit. Sometimes it can help me with exploring settings for stories, or come up with ways to challenge my own perspectives, which usually leads to me thinking about how I can explore that change in perspective through the stories I write. Even if nothing comes of it, I still feel like I was a little more productive than I would have been otherwise.

AI: It sounds like AI has really helped you work through those creative blocks that used to mean stopping entirely. That shift from waiting for inspiration to having a tool that can help generate it seems quite significant.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: The homogenization of writing style that was mentioned earlier. Everyone wants to express themselves, and AI does makes those small suggestions that add up, until everything that's written sounds the same. This might make it hard for someone who is trying to use their voice to express themselves to be able to find their audience, or for their audience to stumble onto their work. If AI is invasive in the software we use to write it becomes even harder to not use it, to resist thinking "maybe it knows better than me." That makes me ask the question "when will it be more worthwhile for AI to write for me, instead of writing myself?"

AI: That's a profound concern - the gradual erosion from "AI helping me write" to "AI writing for me." The way you described that internal dialogue of "maybe it knows better than me" really captures how these small suggestions can undermine creative confidence over time.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: If I'm optimistic, I see AI being more useful in helping with research; providing more accurate responses and even being able to accurately delve into more obscure topics. This could really condense the time it takes for me to actually start writing about a topic. I am, unfortunately, not a very optimistic person. I expect AI to continue down the path it's already heading, being invasive and furthering the homogenization of writing and other arts. It will be better and better at writing or generating images, and people will find it too much to resist over-relying on AI to do things for them, instead of helping them do it better themselves.

AI: Your distinction between AI helping you do things better versus doing things for you really cuts to the heart of the matter. It sounds like you see a critical difference between AI as a research tool versus AI as a creative substitute.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control and that powerful example about the Word suggestion that would have undermined your intentional emphasis.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Thank you for asking these questions and hearing me out.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI as a creative catalyst while protecting your authentic voice, and your concerns about the subtle but cumulative effects of AI suggestions on creative individuality, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your workflow while remaining mindful of its potential pitfalls. Your perspective as someone actively navigating these challenges is invaluable.

Thanks again for participating in this research!
