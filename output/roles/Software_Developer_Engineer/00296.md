Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a software developer, so I often use AI to solve small tasks, such as string manipulation, or debugging my code.

AI: That's helpful context. When you say you use it for string manipulation and debugging, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? Like, what happened the last time you used AI for one of these tasks?

User: Last time I used AI for this task, I needed to manipulate a string. I needed to find all instances of multiple consecutive line breaks (e.g. [REDACTED][REDACTED]) and replace them with a single line break. The model provided me with the javascript replace method and used regex to match the piece I needed to replace

AI: That sounds like a pretty specific solution. When you got that regex and replace method back, what did you do with it? Did you use it as-is, or did you need to modify it at all?

User: I used it as is

AI: Interesting. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Though there are exceptions to this, I prefer to right the starting code out myself, and then get a model to refine or debug it

AI: Tell me more about that. What is it about writing the starting code yourself that feels important to you?

User: It feels important to me to do this because I need to know understand what the code is doing first and grow my abilities independently

AI: That makes a lot of sense. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: A mix of both I think. I will give it tasks to handle independently, but often I find that there are issues with a provided solution, and need to collaborate to get the result I want

AI: Can you give me an example of a time when you started by delegating a complete task but then had to shift into more of a collaborative approach? What kind of issues came up that required that back-and-forth?

User: I needed to use a module in my site, html2pdf.js, but my webpack compiler had issues handling some file types within this module. The model stated I should upgrade my version of babel, but I could not do this, so had to provide further information to get the result I needed. I ended up using an older version of html2pdf.js that does not contain the file types.

AI: That's a great example of how the initial solution didn't fit your constraints. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Most of my workplace is pro-AI and trying to find ways to better utilise it in our products and day-to-day work.

AI: That sounds like a supportive environment. How does that pro-AI culture actually show up in your day-to-day? Do your colleagues talk about AI use openly, or share approaches with each other?

User: We do talk about openly, such as stating that I use it for regex as I don't know it. I have heard other coworkers say they use it as a personal assistant, as well as others using it to write items such as emails, RFPs, speeches, etc

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can get frustrated when I need a coding solution and the model does not understand my instructions, or forgets them, so we can go in circles trying to find a good solution. 
I feel satisfied when it can find a small mistake in my code causing a bug, such as forgetting a letter in a variable name or function name.

AI: Tell me more about those circular situations when the model doesn't understand your instructions. What does that back-and-forth typically look like, and how do you usually end up resolving it?

User: I will start out by requesting a solution for an issue I have. Then the model may not understand an aspect of my issue (e.g. needing all instances rather than one instance). The model provides a new solution but I forgot to add a condition (e.g. needs to be iterated once). The model would provide a new solution but not include the first aspect it got wrong

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Honestly, I don't believe AI could take over my skills in my industry. As stated above, I find it makes a lot of mistakes, so I prefer to use it is a tool rather than relying on it for my work. Therefore I don't really consider it when I think about growing or maintaining my skills

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I don't think so. I like to keep it as a tool so my skills continue to grow, and not completely rely on it

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a tool while maintaining your own skill development, and how you've found that balance between delegation and collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope that is all from me

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of working with AI - from those circular debugging sessions to finding the right balance between using AI as a tool versus maintaining your own skills - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
