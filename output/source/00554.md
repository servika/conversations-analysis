Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I am ready to proceed

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Yes, I am an educator, and I use AI every day. I use it to help me brainstorm activities when the ones I have are not working for a specific set of students or if there is a very specific disconnect happening on a skillset, it helps me come up with some different ways of explaining or different methods of practice that might not be intuitive for me but would be helpful for a student who thinks differently. I also use it to create presentations for me. I input either the exact script I want on each slide or my rough notes on the topic and then it generates the slides I want which saves me a massive amount of time. Of course, I review them and make changes as necessary, deleting or adding material, rearranging etc. I also use it to help me create assignments and sentence frames that are more individualized. I don't have time in the day to create new sentence frames and inidividualized work for every student, but it has helped me differentiate more and provide the students who need extra support with more support. It also helps me get ideas to challenge my more advanced students more and helps create those differentiated assignments which normally would take me so long to make. I sometimes also have it help me create insightful and meaningful feedback for parents, but that is more a collaborative writing session as it is too personal for it to do on its own.

AI: That's a really comprehensive picture of how you're integrating AI across different aspects of your teaching. It sounds like you're using it in some pretty sophisticated ways.

Tell me more about that process when you're brainstorming activities for students who are struggling with a specific concept. How does that interaction typically unfold?

User: I will tell the model what the objectives were and the assignment that I asked the students to do and then I will show it the work of the struggling student without the name attached of course, and ask it to help me pinpoint where the disconnect is happening. At this stage, I will often provide with background (nonsensitive) of the student if its relevant and what I think might be happening. The model then takes this information and gives me an analysis of what it sees as the weakness and where the disconnect might be happening. Sometimes, it is clearly wrong but usually if I correct or provide additional information, it will be more accurate. I evaluate its response on whether it is helpful or not and then I usually mold it a little or probe a little deeper before asking it to for strategies to help bridge the gap or close the disconnect and also ideas to incorporate these strategies into the lesson. Sometimes I also ask it to help me create some assignments centered around this.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you've developed a really collaborative diagnostic process. You mentioned that sometimes the AI is clearly wrong in its initial analysis, but then gets more accurate when you provide corrections or additional information.

Can you walk me through what that back-and-forth looks like when you're correcting or refining its understanding? What kinds of things does it typically miss or get wrong at first?

User: hmmm, that's a tricky one. Sometimes, it doesn't have enough background like if i forgot to tell it that the student is ESL then it may come up with a reason for the disconnect that is far more general and does not apply to the situation where as if I go "that doesn't soudn quite right here because he is paying attention and is engaged, but English IS his second language" then it will take that information and make a more specific and often more accurate answer

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the ESL context would completely change how you'd approach a learning challenge. It sounds like you've become quite skilled at recognizing when the AI needs more context versus when its analysis is on track.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several different uses - from brainstorming to creating presentations to parent feedback. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I do not let AI grade or provide student feedback on writing. It could potentially help, but 1. writing is so nuanced and AI is not always the best writer, especially when it comes to voice or context. 2. I need to personally know my students as writers and how they are growing and developing which means I have to be the one in the trenches myself.

AI: That's a really clear boundary you've drawn. It sounds like there's both a quality concern and something deeper about maintaining that direct connection with your students' growth as writers.

Tell me more about that second point - about needing to personally know your students as writers. What would you lose if you weren't "in the trenches" yourself with their writing?

User: If I wasn't actively engaged in reading their writing and working with them on it, then I would lose such a rich part of our relationships. Students often open up in writing in ways they don't in the classroom. Students often have different voices when writing than what you expect from them. I would miss hearing their written voice and developing that relationship more. I would also be disconnected from their struggle and successes and from their growth.

AI: That's really powerful - the idea that writing becomes this window into who your students are beyond what you see in the classroom. It sounds like reading their work directly is essential for building those deeper relationships.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it seems like you collaborate with it quite a bit rather than just handing off complete tasks. Is that accurate?

User: yes I never just give it something to do. It is a constant back and forth collaboration. Although, I will say that the more I use it, the less back and forth it needs from me.

AI: That's interesting - so you're getting better at setting it up for success from the start. 

Can you give me a sense of what that learning curve has looked like? What are you doing differently now in those initial prompts compared to when you first started using AI?

User: I have learned to be proactive in my requests by being very specific about what I want and don't want and what I am trying to achieve. I have also learned to ask it to save information about how I want things in its memory and that if I want it differently I will ask specifically. This has allowed some "presets" to take over and while it sometimes forgets it makes for a lot less back and forth and we can get down to the real analysis and work of everything

AI: That's really smart - essentially training it to understand your preferences and style over time. It sounds like you've developed a pretty sophisticated working relationship with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or are you navigating this more on your own?

User: I work from home as an online educator, so to be honest, I don't really know how others are using it.

AI: Ah, that makes sense - you're essentially pioneering your own approach without much external influence.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, I have a student who is autistic and I am teaching him writing, but he is having such a hard time with the concept that we need to write in a different way than we speak. The AI really helped me frame it in very concrete terms of knowing two different languages (even though they are both English) and the convention and rules associated with the two different languages. After I started to teach it in that perspective, it really clicked with the student.

AI: That's a wonderful example - it sounds like the AI helped you find just the right metaphor that made everything click for him. The idea of framing speaking and writing as two different languages is really clever.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I do think about how maintaining skills but honestly its so much like a collaboration the way i use it. It's more like I get to sit down with a colleague and work through things together and create things together, like shared planning times in schools where teachers collaborate, so its not like I'm just turnign my brain off and letting AI do all the work.

AI: That's a great analogy - the collaborative planning time comparison really captures how you're using it as a thinking partner rather than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will continue to evolve and help me think even deeper and provide even more insightful analysis. I think it will make it so I can focus on the heart of teaching and the part that really matters and less on the tedious aspects like the physical creation of the slides.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - AI handling the more mechanical aspects so you can focus on the relational and analytical heart of teaching.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've developed this collaborative diagnostic process for helping struggling students, and your clear boundaries around maintaining direct connection with your students' writing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
