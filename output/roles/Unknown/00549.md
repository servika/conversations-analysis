Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I think now is as good a time as any to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently, I use it to adjust the tone of my slack messages, help me write menial emails that take me away from more important duties, find better staffing solutions for my department , I.e., division of labor

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across several different areas of your work. 

When you mention using AI to find better staffing solutions and division of labor for your department, can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice?

User: So I look at the production goals, which we call customer experience. My job revolves around bringing in the materials needed to fulfill those promises so if, for example, I have 8 people on staff for the day, I will ask AI how to best utilize my headcount based on outgoing needs. For example, if I see that I am going to be using a lot of one type of box that is typically used on both levels of the warehouse, but one has much longer turn around time, I may ask AI to divide the team in the most efficient way where both floors are being serviced efficiently

AI: That's a fascinating use case - you're essentially using AI as a strategic planning partner for workforce allocation. 

Walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're working through one of these staffing decisions. Do you give AI all the data upfront and ask for a complete plan, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation where you're bouncing ideas off each other?

User: So I start by looking at the volume for the day. In this example, let's say that a 10 hour shift has a customer experience of 200,000 packages. I have two floors I service, in addition to needing to unload x numbers of trailers to supply those floors. I will tell AI I have 5 people on staff for the day. 2 are really good workers, 1 is forklift trained, and the other 2 are mediocre. The second floor takes longer to run product to, but the first floor, if running lean can be run by one person. I would start out by asking how to divide that labor most efficiently so neither floor runs out of corrugate which delays the shipping of packages

AI: That's really detailed operational planning. It sounds like you're giving AI quite a bit of context about your team's capabilities and constraints.

When AI gives you recommendations for how to divide that labor, what happens next? Do you typically implement the suggestions directly, or do you find yourself adjusting them based on things AI might not know about your specific situation?

User: Obviously the AI provides a framework. Sometimes I will ignore its suggestions, but others I will ask it to redo it so in a way that allocates more staff upstairs for x amount of time until I need to pull someone down to the first floor or vice versa. I will also throw in hypothetical scenarios that require all associates to be off the floor for a meeting and how best to set up the floor before hand so there is less risk of a stock out

AI: That's a really collaborative approach - you're using AI as a thinking partner rather than just taking its initial output. 

You mentioned that sometimes you ignore AI's suggestions entirely. Can you think of a specific example when that happened? What made you decide the AI's recommendation wasn't the right fit for your situation?

User: For sure. There have been times where it allocated no one to the first floor at all despite me inputting the volume for that production area, or if it ignores a prompt that I have attrition after a certain time and will assume that person is working the whole day. There have also been occasions where it went off script completely and started allocating my employees to others departments to meet customer demand

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI sometimes misses key constraints or makes assumptions that don't match your reality. The example of it allocating your employees to other departments is particularly interesting since that's completely outside your scope of control.

When these kinds of misunderstandings happen, how does it affect your confidence in using AI for these planning decisions? Do you find yourself double-checking its suggestions more carefully, or does it change how you frame your questions?

User: AI is a tool. Tools help the user and if I see a tool being used incorrectly, it is something I can fix through rephrasing, or reevaluating the data I provided. I am responsible for what I tell it and unless it hallucinates, the error is usually human

AI: That's a really mature perspective on the relationship - taking ownership for how you use the tool rather than expecting it to read your mind.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several different tasks - tone adjustment for Slack messages, email writing, and this workforce planning. Are there certain tasks in your role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: There are certain colleagues I won't bother utilizing AI for communicating with for whatever reason. Sometimes, if I have a light day of volume, or trucks coming in, it is easier for me to manually plan. With that said, during our peak times, that can be impossible

AI: That's really telling - it sounds like your decision to use AI isn't just about capability, but also about context and relationships.

When you say there are certain colleagues you won't use AI for communicating with "for whatever reason," what drives that choice? Is it something about the nature of your relationship with them, or the type of conversations you're having?

User: it can be both. I tend to examine the audience of the message before making the decision. If it is senior management, I will make sure my messages are short, to the point, and professional. If its another department manager, if I have a relationship with them, it doesn't need to be as formal. If it is a project communication, I will usually ask AI to proofread it and adjust to be more objective

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're tailoring your approach based on both the relationship and the stakes involved. 

When you do use AI for these communications, especially with senior management or for project work, how do you typically interact with it? Are you asking it to write something from scratch, or are you more likely to draft something first and then have AI refine it?

User: I may add that I need the message to say. For example, if we missed a deadline, or stocked out, I will ask it explain based on criteria I provide why that occurred. The same can be said with successes. I may provide a short two to three sentence context and then refine the message as the AI returns the results

AI: That's a really strategic use - having AI help you structure explanations for critical business outcomes. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: For sure. We have a report that shows us exactly how many of each box type is used on any given date and it can be exported as CSV file. Our ordering team had an issue over sending underused boxes while shorting us our most used box types. I fed the CSV, roughly a month worth of usage, asked it compare that to recent purchase orders, and show trends so I could address the issue with ordering team so that we did't have excess unusable corrugate on the dock and empty spaces on the production floor. When I brought that to the meeting, management was more than happy to address the issue with the ordering team and we spent less money on emergency and hoc transfers of materials and had less dwelling product

AI: That's a great success story - using AI to turn raw data into actionable insights that had real business impact. It sounds like AI helped you make a compelling case with concrete evidence.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over more tasks? Is this something you actively consider as you use these tools more in your work?

User: I think for my role in particular, AI can be a powerful tool and eventually replace a lot of what I do in the day. As far as my team goes, unless we automate the movement aspect of taking product from the trailer to production floor, it's less likely to be anything more than a delegation tool

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - recognizing that the physical aspects of your team's work create a natural boundary for AI automation, while your own analytical and planning work is more susceptible to change.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently a year from now?

User: Of course! As I continue to refine my skills at using AI, I have no doubt I will find new ways to implement. For example, I am currently trying to figure out a way to integrate it into our yard management system to auto generate trailer reports and send them to vendors at the start and end of shifts to ensure we don't have gridlock in our shipping yard

AI: That sounds like an exciting next step - moving from using AI for individual decisions to potentially automating entire communication workflows.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on taking ownership for how you use AI as a tool, and how you're strategically choosing when and how to deploy it based on context and relationships.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I would like to learn more about implementing APIs into some of my programs for automation purposes

AI: That's a great point - it sounds like you're already thinking about the next level of integration, moving beyond individual tasks to building AI into your systems and workflows directly.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic planning partner, the importance of understanding its limitations, and how you adapt your approach based on context and relationships will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Your perspective on taking responsibility for how you use these tools, rather than expecting them to be perfect, really stood out as a mature and effective approach to working with AI.

User: thank you

AI: You're very welcome! I really enjoyed our conversation and learning about how you're using AI in such practical, strategic ways. Your insights will definitely contribute to our understanding of how people are successfully integrating these tools into their work.

Have a great rest of your day!
