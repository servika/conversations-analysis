Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, lets go

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My work is very varied, depending what stage of a project I am at. During research and ideation phase I may use it to generate summaries of current research or scientific knowledge, to provide introductions to a place or institution, to generate images that might be used in illustrative documents, or to rewrite / edit documents for use in descriptive treatments.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse set of applications across different project phases. 

When you're using AI for these tasks - like generating those research summaries or editing documents - are there certain types of work you still prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes. The really creative part of film and TV ideation requires detailed knowledge of audience preferences, channel requirements, budgets, scheduling restrictions and even the personalities involved (on- and off- screen). So the broad concept and scope of a proposal is always best led by humans.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's a lot of contextual knowledge and relationship dynamics that inform those creative decisions.

When you do use AI for the tasks you mentioned - like research summaries or document editing - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete brief and let it handle things independently?

User: Again it varies: for factual summaries intended for internal use I'll typically let AI handle a brief independently. For documents and images that may be seen by third parties, I'll collaborate with AI to refine the product.

AI: That distinction between internal versus external-facing work is really interesting - it sounds like the audience and stakes influence how much oversight you maintain.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: I think we're all learning through experience still, as we learn the capabilities and normalise use of AI in the work place. I'm still coming across instances of use by colleagues that can surprise me, and which might inspire me to try using AI in a new context that I hadn't previously considered. So yes, seeing how colleagues have used AI influences me to explore new ways to use it. Equally, there are times when AI output is inappropriate. As an industry we are reaching consensus on where those boundaries lie, and developing a new culture that reflects that.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like there's this collective learning process happening where you're all discovering the boundaries together.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When editing a film, its not uncommon to find places where the precise dialogue that you need to connect two scenes doesn't exist in the recorded material. With AI, its easy now to generate those words in the exact voice of the character concerned: this is both dangerous (if ever exploited as a way to manipulate people into say things they never said in reality) and extremely useful (when used to generate temporary content that can be replaced with actual words at a later date). Discovering this use of AI was an exciting moment.

AI: That's a really compelling example - you can see both the creative potential and the ethical complexity wrapped up in one discovery.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Its something we are all considering in the media industry. For music composers, CG artists, editors, researchers etc, there are many aspects of our work that are clearly going to become redundant. In my role, I may expand my skill set in order to make better use of AI potential in some of these areas where I might previously have commissioned freelancers to carry out the work. But the core skills of human editorial judgement that are at the heart of my work I believe will always be required, so I will certainly maintain them.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - adapting to expand into areas where you might have previously worked with freelancers while protecting your core editorial judgment.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It will continue as a double-edged sword for a while. I'll be somewhat reluctant in some respects, but I'll also embrace the positive aspects - I think that it will be necessary in order to stay relevant and ahead of the curve.

AI: That really captures the tension many people seem to be navigating - the push and pull between caution and necessity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you and your colleagues are collectively discovering boundaries and developing new workplace culture around AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we are all waiting for issues around IP and streaming revenue to crystallise. That will be fascinating. Do you have any insights on how commercial use of AI generated content is going to be monitored and/or controlled?

AI: That's such an important question, and honestly, it's one that's still very much evolving. The intersection of AI-generated content with intellectual property law and revenue streams is something the entire industry - and regulators - are grappling with right now. There are ongoing discussions about everything from copyright ownership of AI outputs to how streaming platforms will handle attribution and revenue sharing for AI-assisted content.

As a researcher, I'm really interested in how these unresolved questions are affecting your day-to-day decision making. It sounds like there's this layer of uncertainty that everyone in your industry is navigating while still trying to stay competitive and relevant.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative learning process in your workplace and the balance between embracing AI capabilities while maintaining core human skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
