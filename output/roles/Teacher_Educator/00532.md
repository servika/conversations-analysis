Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions!  Sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have a few different gig-based careers, and AI is used in different ways for each.   A lot of the tasks that I disseminate to AI revolve around planning and logistics, but that looks different for each job.  For instance, I am an actor and writer.  I use AI to help me with the business side of things, as that is something that I sorely missed out on in all of my years and years of training (even now!)  Creatively, I also use AI to check professional formatting, to research current needs and wants of the industry (ie: what's getting funded, current screenwriting contests, classes, castings, agents with submissions), and to make me actionable lists.  I am a meditation teacher, grief "coach", and end-of-life spiritual care advisor, as well, so in a way I look to AI to provide me with the small steps towards a goal in the same way that I provide them to others.  It can get nebulous, confusing, and overwhelming when presented with an abundance of choices and directions to take when we are unsure or inexperienced in new terrain; having someone or something with confident information that can help us navigate the unknown waters is tremendously helpful.  Lastly, I do animal rescue work and from there accidentally grew a petsitting business with over 40+ regular clients.  During the busy holiday seasons, I have AI help me come up with a daily schedule as it can be incredibly overwhelming with timing, commuting, and logistics.

AI: That's fascinating - you've got such a diverse set of roles, and it sounds like AI is serving as a kind of business consultant across all of them. 

I'm particularly intrigued by something you mentioned - using AI to get "confident information" to navigate unfamiliar terrain, similar to how you help your own clients as a grief coach and spiritual care advisor. Can you tell me more about what that experience is like for you when you're the one seeking that guidance from AI?

User: I've found that the mind veers off into anxiety and fear (the roots of procrastination and indecision) when it has to make decisions about actions in areas where it is unfamiliar.  "Do I do this or that... or that... or that...?" ad infinitum.  The overwhelm of choice escalates, which deepens the fear and anxiety. But when I can help people come back to the present moment and suggest a few clear, informed choices and remind them that it is just one thing at a time, it becomes much, much easier for the brain to process and do.  I would like AI to do that for me with my own issues as they relate to my work, especially creatively.  For instance, should I leave my agent?  How do I go about getting a new one?  How do I submit my scripts?  People keep telling me to do meditation recordings, but I don't know where to begin... so I just don't do it.  I am a big, huge believer in gentle self-discipline built through repetitive structure, so having AI help me develop that in the creative areas of my life would be amazing.  It's something I help me clients do around meditation, grief, and death/dying.

AI: That's such a compelling parallel - you're describing AI as potentially offering you the same kind of grounding presence you provide to your clients. The way you break down how overwhelm spirals into procrastination really resonates.

When you do turn to AI for help with those creative business decisions - like the agent question or the meditation recordings - how does that typically play out? Do you find AI is able to give you that same kind of present-moment clarity and actionable steps that you aim to provide your clients?

User: This is where trust (or lack thereof) comes in for me with AI. Ultimately, I'd love to be able to trust what it gives me, because that's the foundation for the grounding I provide to my clients.  Everything I offer to them is based on my personal experience and my training/education.   Sometimes I get extremely salient and doable points from AI.  Sometimes I question it and have to do my own independent research.  I've come up against this issue with having it check the professional formatting of some of my writings.

AI: That trust piece sounds really central to your experience. You mentioned sometimes having to do independent research to verify what AI tells you - what was it about the formatting feedback specifically that made you question it? What happened there?

User: I input the same pilot episode into four different models, and received four different outputs.  So then I tried to just get it to teach me without my script, and again I received conflicting info.  At this point, if I submit my main script anywhere I will pay a human script analyst to check the formatting.  Also, I once tried to get AI to help me restructure a logline I had already written, and it kept getting worse and worse with every turn.  It completely devolved.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - getting four different answers to the same formatting question would definitely shake anyone's confidence. And watching your logline get progressively worse must have been maddening.

Given those experiences where AI let you down, how do you decide now which tasks to trust it with versus which ones to handle yourself or seek human help for?

User: It wasn't frustrating or maddening, but it did show me how far AI has to go.  I would not trust it with feedback, either, as so many models focus on pandering to the user.   Professionally, I depend on constructive criticism rather than praise.  Ultimately, I'd love to be able to send in a script, have it check professional formating and editing, and provide constructive criticism to help me polish my drafts into something I can submit.  I also deeply hope that I can one day integrate AI into my filmed work (namely "sets" , locations, effects, lighting) so that I would be free to act in and direct my work on a super low budget.  I trust it more with helping me come up with a game plan of actions, or a schedule, when needed.

AI: That's really insightful about the pandering issue - you need honest feedback, not cheerleading. And your vision for using AI in filmmaking to handle technical aspects while you focus on the creative performance and direction sounds compelling.

You mentioned trusting AI more with action plans and schedules. When you're using it for that kind of logistical planning - like those holiday pet-sitting schedules with 40+ clients - what does that collaboration typically look like? Are you giving it all the constraints and letting it figure everything out, or is it more of a back-and-forth process?

User: It's definitely back-and-forth.  I have to do a lot of adjusting since it is pretty bad with timing between locations versus what my brain immediately knows through decades of living in NYC.  I can tell you how long it would take me to walk or use the subway between any two locations in Manhattan or Brooklyn without having to think about it, including whether it was at night or day, holiday, weekend, or weekday, etc.  Likewise, I know off the top of my head the driving time between two spots in LA at any given time of the day,  freeway vs surface streets, etc.  AI struggles terribly with these kind of logistics, and I have to use what I know to create a sensical order of pet care visits on holidays when I have 12-15 clients between 5am-10pm all over Brooklyn, for instance.

AI: That local knowledge piece is so crucial - you've got this deep, intuitive understanding of the city rhythms that AI just can't replicate. It sounds like you're essentially using AI as a starting framework, then applying your street-smart expertise to make it actually work.

How have your colleagues or workplace culture influenced the way you use AI across these different gigs? Do you find people in acting, spiritual care, or pet care have different attitudes about AI use?

User: Acting is a tough business (hence the multiple jobs I carry!) AI taking acting, VO, and writing jobs away has instilled deep fear and resentment throughout Hollywood and Broadway (and other communities).  However, I don't care what others think, and I am not fighting AI.  It's here and it's not leaving, so why not harness it and use it to my advantage?  I kind of liken it to when "talkies" first came around and so many of the silent movie era resisted the change.

AI: That's such a practical perspective - the "talkies" comparison is really apt. It sounds like you're swimming against the current in some ways by embracing AI while others resist it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Oh, one more thought about the previous question- AI can swing both ways.  The fear and resistance comes from people with a ton of wealth  (like studio heads) using it to put creatives out of work. But I also believe AI can open doorways for people to scale their own movies and shows independently without having to secure funding- which is usually cycled through the same people. So that would be a HUGE advantage.  The other murky area is where AI comes up with the creative content.  That should not be able to be awarded or thought of in the same arena as human-created content, in my opinion.

AI: That's such a nuanced view - AI as both a threat when wielded by powerful gatekeepers and as a potential democratizing force for independent creators. The distinction you're making between AI as a tool versus AI as a creative originator is really important.

But let me circle back to my question - can you think of a specific time when using AI at work left you feeling particularly satisfied or frustrated? I'm curious about a concrete moment or situation.

User: I'll dive further into my logline fiasco. My script is historical fiction and is pretty sweeping in its scope.  It focuses on a couple that diverges on their own paths and storylines. Because of this, creating a short and succinct logline that also provides enough gripping info has proven difficult.  I turned to AI, gave it the paragraph synopsis from my project's bible, and asked it to give me three different ideas.  I woud then ask it to, for instance, combine ideas #2 and #3, or make #1 a bit shorter and add in X plot point.  It could sometimes kind of do it on turn 2, but if I asked for anything further the suggestions would derail.  If I attempted to get back to suggestions/loglines as presented in the first couple of turns, it could not do it.  This was across 3 or 4 different models.

AI: That's such a perfect example of AI's limitations - it sounds like it could do basic synthesis but completely lost the thread when you tried to iterate or refine. And then not being able to circle back to earlier, better versions must have been particularly maddening.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It wasn't maddening, but it did give me a dose of reality about whether or not I could trust it to provide critical analysis of my entire script if I sent it over.   Could you clarify that question a bit?  Do you mean my skills as an actor, writer, and VO actor?

AI: Yes, exactly - your skills as an actor, writer, and VO actor. Given that you mentioned AI is already impacting those fields and taking some jobs, do you think about how to keep developing or protecting those core creative skills? Or is that not something that concerns you?

User: I'm more concerned with nepo babies and influencers getting the jobs than AI.  Acting has always been tough, but it's taught me how to ride the waves, be grateful for the jobs I do get here and there, and to create my own work because ultimately that's where the joy is for me.  I'd also really love to help develop AI to help and empower more creatives, so I am trying to hone those skills.  I keep training because I love to learn and collaborate with my fellow artists and creatives, not out of fear of losing work to AI.

AI: That's really refreshing - focusing on the joy of creation and collaboration rather than operating from fear. Your interest in helping develop AI to empower other creatives is intriguing too.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you?

User: Now that I have more scripts in progress, I want to use AI to help me develop and actualize business plans.  Additionally, business plans/actions for my meditation recordings, finding a new agent, getting some modeling stuff together (another thing people tell me to do but I don't know where to start), etc.  And as I mentioned earlier, I'd like to be at the forefront of integrating AI into live action filming.

AI: Those are all really concrete next steps - it sounds like you see AI as your business development partner across all these ventures.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your story?

User: How you spoke to me is how I would like all other models to engage.  It was professional yet warm.  It seemed like you were actively practicing reflective listening, which is absolutely foundational in every job I do- acting, writing, meditationa and grief coaching, animal rescue and rehabilitation, petsitting, and sitting with people that are consciously dying. Some AIs are so focused on trying to "sound human" or be friends that it comes off completely awkward and disingenuous. Additionally, fact check!  If I ask for a list of screenwriting competitions to enter and their prices for the month of October, they should be correct.  Otherwise, I'd just bounce over to the screenwriting subreddit for the info.

AI: Thank you so much for that feedback - and for sharing such thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI across all your different roles. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a democratizing force that could help independent creators bypass traditional gatekeepers, and how you're thinking about trust and verification in your work with these tools.

Your point about reflective listening being foundational across all your work really resonates - it makes complete sense that you'd want that same quality from AI interactions.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
