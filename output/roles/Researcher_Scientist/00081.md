Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds great, ask away!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently completed a long term project (a PhD) which was broken down into a number of smaller project. I can talk you though one of the smaller projects as that will take less time. Typically, a project will involve and initial idea that might spawn form a problem or result that we encounter in the lab (this is a wet chemistry lab). For example, I noticed that one of the catalysts we were studying formed a stable intermediate before going on to react further with the reactant. I think took this result to my supervisor and we came up with a rough plan of experiments to try and collect all the data on the intermediate. This plan is fairly standard, involves a number of usual chemistry techniques and forms of data collection, for example,  NMR, X-ray crystallography and IR. After data collection, I would process all the data, then write a report on the results and compare the findings with other similar results from literature. This could all take between 4-8 weeks in total.

AI: That's a really helpful overview - I can see how that process flows from observation to experimentation to analysis and writing. The intermediate catalyst discovery sounds like a fascinating finding.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: During the write up, drafting the final document or asking for tips on paragraph structure. Also, I have experimented with models to assist with condensing text or proof read technical paragraphs. Sometimes, I would write a few options or paragraphs and ask the model to turn it into a single paragraph or summarise the key points.

AI: That's interesting - so you've mainly used AI in the writing and communication phase of your research. 

For those writing tasks you mentioned - like condensing text or proofreading technical paragraphs - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of doing that work yourself or perhaps working with a colleague or supervisor.

User: I decided to use the AI as I find it much faster than my usual approach and the feedback I get on my outputted work has been positive from my colleagues. Typically, other people I work with might try similar tasks and we talk about ways to get the models to produce good outputs in the workplace. Junior roles often involve lots of report writing so this is a way to make that process easier.

AI: That makes sense - the speed advantage and positive feedback would definitely be motivating factors. It sounds like there's even some collaborative learning happening in your workplace around getting good outputs from AI.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the initial idea generation, experimental planning, data collection with NMR and X-ray crystallography, or the data analysis phase - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: There are already methods in place on how I collect, store, process all that data. There may be routes to improving these with AI tools but at the moment I don't feel any reason to change. These are typically the more interesting aspect of my work and I enjoy how I do them. Additionally, they don't take up as much time as the writing so a tool might take a long time to learn but if i only spend a few minutes preparing an NMR and processing the data, and additional tool wouldn't effect how I do it. Additionally, some of my work involves manual processes so models can't help too much. I have used AI to produce code that will extract data form Excel sheets but sometimes the effort to get that up and running isn't worth this time. (for example if i don't have huge amounts of data, it doesn't take long to just do everything maunally)

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like you've considered the time investment versus benefit trade-off quite carefully. The point about enjoying those core experimental aspects of your work is particularly interesting.

When you have used AI for writing tasks - like condensing text or proofreading those technical paragraphs - how do you verify or validate what it produces before you use it in your final work?

User: Compare the results to textbooks. Also, I have a fairly deep understanding of these topics so I have a feeling if something is being oversimplified or overlooked. Additionally, other colleagues will read the work and they all have different points of view/backgrounds and knowledge.

AI: That's a solid approach - using your domain expertise as a filter and having that peer review layer. It sounds like you have multiple checkpoints in place.

We're about two-thirds of the way through now. Here's a hypothetical for you: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Create deep literature reviews and recommend papers based on what I am reading. It can be hard to find papers and a junior researcher. Would be good to keep seeing other people's work in my field from the past 30+ years. Also, creating graphs for papers that link together would be interesting to see. For example, how two similar fields link (for example copolymerisation of styrene and scandium sandwich complexes)

AI: That's fascinating - essentially having AI help you map the intellectual landscape of your field and discover connections you might not have found otherwise. The idea of visualizing how different research areas link together sounds really powerful for a junior researcher trying to understand the broader context.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how you've thoughtfully integrated AI into the writing phase while preserving the experimental work you enjoy, and your approach to validation through domain expertise and peer review, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think that's everything thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the trade-offs between time investment and benefit, and especially your point about preserving the enjoyable, intellectually engaging parts of your research while using AI to streamline the more routine writing tasks, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Your vision for AI-assisted literature mapping also highlights an interesting gap - the need for tools that can help researchers navigate and discover connections in the vast landscape of scientific knowledge.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
