Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a teacher at a secondary school in the UK. I often use AI to find examples for things I'm teaching e.g. I might be teaching biodiversity and want some unique real world examples to keep the students engaged

AI: That's interesting - using AI to find engaging, real-world examples for your lessons. 

Can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? When you're preparing a lesson on something like biodiversity, how do you go about getting those examples from AI?

User: I'd be preparing a slide for a presentation and I'd want to liven it up so I'd ask AI e.g. "can you tell me about why biodiversity is important using a very specific example e.g. recently discovered insect species in a remote area of the world". Then I'd have a quick read, pull out the key facts, add an interesting image to my slide and be ready to teach the students

AI: That sounds like a really efficient workflow you've developed. You mentioned pulling out the key facts and adding your own image - so you're taking what the AI gives you and then shaping it for your classroom.

Tell me more about that process of deciding what to keep and what to modify from the AI's response.

User: I'm very experienced in the classroom, so I know what will engage the students - it might be whatever is particular unusual or useful about the species but not the detail about e.g. how it was found

AI: That makes a lot of sense - drawing on your classroom experience to filter what will actually land with your students.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, that would be talking to / mentoring students

AI: Can you tell me more about what makes talking to and mentoring students something you want to keep for yourself? What is it about those interactions that feels important for you to handle directly?

User: I've built up a relationship with the students; I know their home situations, perhaps any medical conditions inclduing mental health difficulties they might be experiencing, I know their current and aspirational academic scores and I can draw on all this to offer personalised advice

AI: That's a really rich understanding you've built up with your students. It sounds like there's so much context and relationship history that goes into those conversations.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate as I go

AI: Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like as you work through a task? How does that back-and-forth typically unfold?

User: Ok so a class may be struggling with genetics problems but I may have ran out of published exam questions to give them so I could use the AI to help me generate similar but different problems and provide me wth solutions to check my own answers. If the answers differed to mine, I would then review my own answer (although sometimes the AI is wrong!) but it's an extra check.

AI: That's a great example of how you work together - generating problems and then using AI as a kind of second opinion to double-check your solutions. You mentioned that sometimes the AI is wrong and you catch that.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues are a little behind the times with AI, they're only just starting to use it

AI: What's it been like being ahead of the curve with AI while your colleagues are just getting started? Has that affected how you approach using it or talking about it at work?

User: Not really, no, though some of them have come to me for help or been surprised by something I've done

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Saving time e.g. asking it to make a spreadsheet from loads of handwritten note about university destinations of students on Alevel results day

AI: That sounds like a huge time-saver on what's already a pretty hectic day! What made that particular task feel especially satisfying to delegate to AI?

User: Because it saved me time that I could then spend on other things!

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It concerns me more for my childrens generation than my own

AI: What is it about your children's generation that concerns you? What do you see them potentially facing that's different from your situation?

User: There will be some jobs that will have been taken over by AI

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will use it more and more and it will eliminate some of the more mundane tasks so that I can focus on personalising learning more

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - using AI to handle the mundane so you can focus more on the personalized aspects of teaching.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful thoughts about your experience with AI in the classroom. I particularly found it interesting how you've developed this collaborative approach where you use AI as both a content generator and a checking mechanism, while being very clear about keeping the human relationship aspects for yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I've started to use it to help gather admissions data about UK universities e.g. a student could tell me what grades they have, what grades they're likely to get, what CAT Score they have, whether thye feel confident about MMI style interviews, how far they're happy to travel from [REDACTED] etc and the AI can rank which medical schools might be the best fit

AI: That's a really compelling example - using AI to match students with medical schools based on all those different factors. It sounds like you're able to give much more personalized guidance by having AI process all those variables together.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI into different aspects of teaching - from lesson preparation to student guidance - while keeping the core relationship-building for yourself, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
