Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready to go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a registered dietitian providing goal-setting, plans, and follow-ups to my clients.  It requires a lot of client communication through emails and portal messages.  I have been using AI to help me write these messages to my clients, incorporating the data that I provide and sometimes doing simple analysis.  I also manage a team of dietitians/nutritionists and I use AI to help with some administrative tasks like creating meeting agendas, writing performance reviews, and scheduling.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI across different aspects of your role - both the direct client work and the team management side.

When you're crafting those client messages, what does that process typically look like for you? Are you feeding the AI specific client data and then working with it to shape the message, or is it more hands-off once you provide the information?

User: In general, I have templates for some typical messages, so once I feed the AI the data and some background, it will pick the template and customize it based on the client info.  I'll check it and then provide comments if necessary.

AI: That's interesting - so you've essentially created a system where the AI can select from your existing templates and customize them. 

When you're reviewing those customized messages before sending them to clients, what are you typically looking for? What kinds of changes or comments do you find yourself making most often?

User: When using templates, I really just have to do a quick check to make sure there are not any obvious errors like using the wrong template, client name, or misinterpretations of the data.

AI: That sounds like you've developed a pretty streamlined process. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work - whether with clients or managing your team - that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Well I really love the goal-setting and nutritional planning sides of my job, so I would not want to delegate them.  It's the more administrative and repetitive things that I want to push to AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping the parts you find most fulfilling while letting AI handle the routine work.

When you do use AI for those administrative and repetitive tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, like going back and forth on a performance review, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it handle the task independently?

User: There is definitely back and forth on performance reviews because they are so important to the personal development of each individual.  It involves quite a bit of iteration.  However, with other admin tasks like scheduling or meeting agendas, I generally just provide some upfront input and let the AI go to work.

AI: That's a great distinction - the importance of the task seems to drive how much you collaborate versus delegate.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others on your team using it similarly, or have you had to navigate any particular attitudes about AI use?

User: I have made a push to incorporate the use of AI for client communication throughout my team because I think it provides some consistency and definitely efficiency.  My boss (the owner/CEO of the company) is very progressive and loves to use technology to support his people.

AI: That's a really supportive environment to be in. It sounds like you've actually been a champion for AI adoption within your team.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sorry if this gets a little wordy.  We have developed an AI chatbot that our clients can access through our portal.  It mainly is used as the first touchpoint to collect information from the client (whether it be a question about their specific plans, a general question, a technical problem, scheduling request, etc) and then it directs that query to the appropriate person (usually the client's assigned dietitian/nutritionist or the first available).  However, it does have the ability to answer some basic about the client's care.  In one instance, a newer client had gotten overwhelmed in trying to adhere to a new diet and needed some questions answered.  However, it was after business hours and they felt uncomfortable calling their nutritionist directly (which is what we actually prefer), so she went to the portal and asked our AI.  The questions happened to be pretty basic and the AI handled them effectively.  The next morning, the client called to explain how she was near a breakdown until she talked to the AI, but it settled her down and gave her easy to follow instructions.

AI: That's a powerful example - it really shows how AI can provide that crucial support when human help isn't immediately available. It sounds like it made a real difference for that client in a moment when she really needed it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially as you're seeing AI handle more of the communication and administrative work?

User: Honestly, I'm not worried about maintaining my communication and planning skills.  There are so many other parts of my job that require both that I continue to do on a daily basis (and that will not change).  AI is definitely a supportive tool for us, not something that is taking over.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing AI as supportive rather than replacing the core expertise you bring.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or are you pretty satisfied with where things are now?

User: I am very satisfied with where we are at right now.  I think AI has been incredibly helpful in improving consistency and efficiency in areas that are generally low impact for my team.  I mean, there is nothing that AI can mess up that will negatively impact the care our clients get.  It may send a poor communication (but that's our fault for not checking), but that is just an inconvenience and not an emergency.  I don't see other areas at the moment that I want to get AI involved in.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've carved out clear boundaries - using AI for efficiency in low-impact areas while keeping it away from the core nutritional planning and goal-setting work that you value most.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about creating that balance between AI efficiency and maintaining the human expertise that's central to client care will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
