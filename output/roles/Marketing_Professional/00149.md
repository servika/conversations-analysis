Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Go for it Claude

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: It varies, it helps with research - external collation. I also use it to craft outlines for reports, or to pick themes from findings of project reports, it helps to proof reports, provide written content for marketing materials, reports, bids. It helps to see where I'm inconsistent in my writing or have tone confusion (I start objective and slip into emotive for example). I use it as my calculator for %, and ask questions on modelling techniques for the data I'm analysing - if I can pull out themes that I can't see myself. I ask it for excel help when I want to automate a process but don't know how. Ultimately, it helps me to save time, and also expands my skill set

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses. It sounds like you're leveraging AI across different phases of your work - from initial research through to final outputs.

You mentioned that AI helps expand your skill set. Can you tell me more about that? What does that look like in practice?

User: Well with the modelling and evaluation frameworks - I have an [REDACTED] in Sociological Research, but that doesn't mean I know every single methodology - there are new approaches being developed, and using AI brings these to light, explains them and breaks them down so I can understand how they work, helps me test them, points out if I've made an error, and guides me to the right way. The same with excel - the only other way of learning this is through courses or Youtube videos, which is time intensive and you're dealing with ads or a cost and you cant ask questions - with AI you get an answer straight away, you can ask questions, and you can even share an image or paste the formula so any issues can be diagnosed. This expands my skill set - I don't want AI to just 'do it for me' I need to know the how, so that I can do it myself, that way, if I grow then I move onto more difficult tasks, if it does it for me, its likely that I'll get stuck in a rut

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're making - using AI as a learning tool rather than just having it complete tasks for you. It sounds like you're very intentional about maintaining that learning element.

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Writing. AI can write but it isn't quite there yet. Reading AI content lacks the nuance of human written words. I can pick it out AI generated text very easily, and automatically I feel that it has less value - its a shortcut. It lacks that intentionality you mentioned above - like a factory pumping out cheap goods - no one wants this. So I ask the AI to help me with the outline and proofing, but the words are mine, they carry intention.

AI: That's a really vivid way to put it - the factory analogy really captures something important about intentionality in writing. It sounds like you see a clear difference between using AI as support versus having it generate the actual content.

When you do use AI for work - whether it's for research or Excel help or proofing - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate - my tasks are intensive, I couldn't delegate, its more of process to work through, so I work through them with support.

AI: That collaborative approach makes sense given the complexity of what you're working on. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: It's becoming more known. Perhaps in the last three months there has been more discussion around it. I can now see when people are using it for their emails, or in-house surveys. They have just sent out invites to join an AI consultation group to see how AI can be used to improve productivity. But it scares me a bit, I feel that they don't know that they could be replacing staff with this progress - all organisations want to be in the black, and staff are always the largest cost.

AI: That's a really candid perspective - you can see the potential productivity benefits but also the broader implications for employment. It sounds like there's this tension between individual empowerment through AI and organizational cost considerations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It's now more of norm in daily use so I don't get the 'satisfied' feeling I used to when I learned how much time I could save. But frustrations are a daily occurrence. It still has a long way to go, it can't analyse large datasets on excel, it often can't complete what seem to be the simplest tasks. I don't quite trust it, I have to always ask for sources, and open another chat to make the same request for data to check its answers. Still, I find maybe 60% of the time there is an issue - 100% if we're reflecting back over all of the conversations each day.

AI: That 60% error rate is really striking - and the fact that you've developed this routine of double-checking with fresh conversations shows how you've adapted to work around those limitations.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: do you mean how do I feel? Your sentence is awkward?

AI: You're right, let me be clearer. 

Do you actively think about keeping up your own skills in areas where AI is getting better - and if so, how do you approach that?

User: Yes. I will always value human skills more - I think that even though AI can pump out tasks - we still pay more for handcrafted items, they are still viewed with more value than a machine made item - so holding onto my skills is more about maintaining that value and developing. AI lacks creativity.

AI: That handcrafted analogy is really compelling - there's something about human craft that maintains its value even when machines can produce similar outputs.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: explain

AI: What do you think will change about how you use AI at work in the coming months or years? Will you use it differently, or do you expect it to play a bigger or smaller role?

User: That depends on how it evolves, I can only gauge its capacity right now, and that we've already discussed. If it doesn't evolve, how I use it won't evolve. If it evolves, how I use it evolves - but I can't answer based on a future or evolution I don't know

AI: That makes complete sense - you can only work with what's in front of you right now.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning tool rather than just having it do tasks for you, and that handcrafted versus factory-made distinction.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
