Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am writing a novel and I've also written smaller novels and non-fiction books and training materials. But I probably use it most frequently for my novel lately.

AI: That's fascinating - working on a novel is such an involved creative process. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process when you're working on your novel. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I've used it to begin research into things I have limited experience with. For example, I have characters who are FBI agents and ones who work in the funeral business, so I've done a lot of asking questions about what kinds of things would be realistic in those settings and those roles. For example, I'll write a scene and then put it into an LLM and ask if it seems plausible, or if I'm being too Hollywood-educated about it, and what the terms for certain things are. Another thing I use it for is looking for terms for things it would take longer for me to look up. Like when one of my characters decides he doesn't want the monuments business his father wills him, I had to look up the legal papers that would be used for that process. (A disclaimer, apparently.)  
Also, I've used it to put in segments of my book and ask what other parts of the scene i may have overlooked, or trivia that help with the verisimilitude of the story.  
On smaller projects, I've also given the model a general idea of the setting, character, tone of the story, certain happenings that had to happen, and then I ask it to write what basically amounts to a trellis that I can build the actual story around. It helps me with pacing and not getting bogged down in the details of the first chapter instead of moving all the way though the plot. 
I probably use it for more, but that's what is coming to mind right now.  
Oh, and character names or business names sometimes - though I often end up getting inspiration and not final options from the model.

AI: That's a really rich picture of how you're using AI across different aspects of your writing. I'm particularly interested in that research and fact-checking role you described.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, one of the things I used it for was that I have a character whose parents perished using medical euthanasia. I had to ask where they could go to have it done, how their bodies would have been returned to the states (since I sent them to Switzerland) and what diseases they would both have had to justify wanting to pass in a dignified way instead of waiting it out. (He had advanced ALS and she had Pancreatic Cancer, and neither wanted to become a long-term burden to their children. Being as they worked in the funeral industry, they appreciated the sense of being in control of their final moments and not putting their family through the chaos that so many other families went through when death came on its own.) I had to make sure they were diseases that would reasonably have them of sound mind when they made the choice to depart, and that I handled it with some sensitivity because it can be a tender subject for a lot of people.
It felt very helpful to be able to have a relevant conversation about what was going on with my characters and that guide the information I was being provided instead of having to do research for each keyword piece by piece.

AI: That sounds like such a delicate and important part of your story to get right. It's interesting how you were able to have that kind of nuanced conversation with AI about the medical and logistical details while also considering the emotional sensitivity.

When you're working with AI like that - having those research conversations or asking it to check your scenes for plausibility - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: That's all me. But I got my degree in creative writing, so I'm familiar with workshopping and getting ideas that either do or don't work for my story and not feeling like everything that gets suggested has to go into the story. The models often ask to write segments for me, but I prefer to do the writing part myself. 
The models provide ideas and I get to select from those ideas as I see fit. 
I have done some experiments where I gave the model a plot, characters, a few key actions, etc, and asked it to write a chapter, and while that can have a pleasing outcome, it doesn't feel fully mine because the words are my art form.

AI: That's such an insightful distinction - the words being your art form. It sounds like you've found a way to maintain creative ownership while still benefiting from AI as a research partner and idea generator.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I feel like I can write faster because the research isn't as daunting. 
I also feel like putting my writing into the model for feedback allows me to look at it critically without having to take as much time away from it to see it objectively. 
A lot of benefit can be achieved by being mindful about how you feel about feedback as a creator. For example, if someone/something tells you, "your character should say, 'wow!'" and as a creator that feels wrong, it helps clarify how you feel about how your character should react in that moment - clearly you're not going for "wow," so maybe "jeepers" is more authentic to your story or character, or "interesting."

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to use feedback - using it as a mirror to clarify your own creative instincts. It sounds like AI has become a tool for both efficiency and self-discovery in your process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I don't think I do. I'm a little concerned about people not paying human writers to do what AI can do more quickly, but I think the people who do that probably couldn't afford to pay human writers appropriately, or would choose not to anyway.
I like to tell my kids that Steven King doesn't sell fewer books because VC Andrews also writes books. There is always competition and your readers will still love your work when you get it in front of them even if they do have other authors on the shelf.

AI: That's such a grounded perspective - the Steven King and VC Andrews analogy really captures something important about how readers connect with different voices and styles.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Honestly, I don't know what to anticipate from it. I'm kinda going with the flow and learning as we go. I'd like to see more domestic support technology developed so I can keep writing more books and making more art without feeling guilty that my dishes won't wash themselves (I don't have a dishwasher) and my laundry won't fold itself. But that's probably more peripheral than you intended to go.

AI: I love that answer - it really shows how creativity exists within the whole context of life, and sometimes the most helpful technology might be the one that gives you more time to create.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI feedback as a way to clarify your own creative instincts - that's such a sophisticated approach to collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of at this time.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative ownership while leveraging AI as a research partner and sounding board will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've developed such a thoughtful approach to integrating AI into your writing process while keeping the words - your art form - as your own. Best of luck with your novel!
