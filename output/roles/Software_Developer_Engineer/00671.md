Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, we can begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Yeah, so as a software engineer, I tend to use AI throughout my standard workflow. If I am trying to implement a new feature, or research about the pros and cons of a technical solution, I might start with a research gathering prompt with an LLM, either in [REDACTED], my typical IDE or using a LLM's chat interface. When it comes to actually implementation of features, it depends on the complexity. For tasks, which are well defined and simple, I may outsource the entire task to the LLM and simply review the code it provides, for others, I may use an agent and approve the code it provides at each step of the process.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned that complexity drives whether you outsource the entire task or use more of a step-by-step approach with an agent.

Can you walk me through what makes a task feel "well defined and simple" versus something that needs that more collaborative, step-by-step process?

User: Sure, I tend to use my intuition on this - for example, unit tests, simple refactors, or looping logic tend to be very easy to define and implement. Additionally, using the LLM as a simple reference for well-defined CSS patterns can be very helpful since many of these simply require strong recall.

AI: That makes sense - you're drawing on your intuition about what requires recall versus what needs more complex reasoning.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Without providing visual aides, and since we don't have strong design docs we can provide at context, I typically have to implement a lot of the frontend on my own to preserve styles, especially when there are subtle but important differences between the various pages we use. Additionally, I find that AI can struggle to identify where to implement a simple feature when the necessary imports and function calls may be spread over multiple repositories or files within those repos.

AI:

User: Let's continue: To answer your previous question - Without providing visual aides, and since we don't have strong design docs we can provide at context, I typically have to implement a lot of the frontend on my own to preserve styles, especially when there are subtle but important differences between the various pages we use. Additionally, I find that AI can struggle to identify where to implement a simple feature when the necessary imports and function calls may be spread over multiple repositories or files within those repos.

AI: That's a great point about the contextual challenges - the visual styling nuances and the complexity of multi-file, multi-repo architectures.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: When I spend more time developing the prompt and know that it has strong guardrails and guidelines in place, I would likely outsource it to an AI agent to take care of, and simply test the implementation after. If the task is more vague and I'm more reliant on the AI to come up with the appropriate solution, I tend to go through iterations and interrupt the model at various stages, when I find it is veering from my intended strategy or use-case, in a way that is either sub-optimal or going to cause an issue with a feature it is unaware of.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like the amount of upfront clarity you have about the task determines your approach. You mentioned interrupting the model when it veers from your intended strategy or might cause issues with features it's unaware of.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I'm at a very small startup, where the engineering team consists of myself, and occasional contracted assistance. As such, it is necessary to utilize AI in more tasks that I might typically, simply for the speed of implementation. The ability to lean on an AI model to complete some defined task after typical work hours, and to be able to come back and review tasks and use this downtime is crucial to our speed of developing new features and meeting client deadlines.

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - using AI almost as an extension of your team capacity, especially for after-hours work where you can queue up tasks and review them later.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure, there are times when despite the task not being overly complex, the models seem to be experience high-volumes and the quality drops quite a bit. It is particularly noticeable as you get further into a high-context long prompt conversation. To have to go from all of this context and history, to essentially need to reset and start again, is quite obnoxious and demotivating. This is unfortunately a very common issue, that tends to pop up - since context is limited and performance bottlenecks are the norm with the large

AI: That sounds really frustrating - having to essentially lose all that built-up context and start over, especially when you're deep into a complex problem. You mentioned this happens when models are experiencing high volumes and the quality drops.

Tell me more about how that affects your workflow when you have to reset like that.

User: Well, it depends on where we are in the implementation of a feature, but assuming it involves numerous steps - I would have to pause, take account of all partially implemented changes and details, re-explain the project/prompt goals, and add even more context as to where the current work stands. This can easily take 15 - 30 minutes and sometimes it's easier to just reset and start from scratch depending on where things stand.

AI: That 15-30 minute reset time really adds up, especially when you're trying to maintain momentum on a feature. It sounds like you have to make a judgment call about whether it's worth rebuilding that context or just starting fresh.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yeah, absolutely. I think that having the models explain and justify details, and even asking them to teach me about solutions I'm not aware of are key. I also use some of my personal time to continually study new patterns and practice various aspects of coding, as the atrophy from not writing code each day is very real. Additionally, when the task is quite simple, or too complex, I will implement it myself - only turning to AI if I hit some sort of snag.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI as a teacher and being strategic about when to practice yourself. You mentioned atrophy being "very real" when you don't write code each day.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that we are likely to become more and more reliant as time passes. Although, I do think that once the models get to a certain level, likely the next stage will be making the UI/UX and interaction with these models simpler. Right now the steps involved in prompt engineering can be quite complex, and repetitive, and I believe this is likely to be improved as it becomes more of a standard workflow for developers.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - that we're moving toward simplifying the interaction layer rather than just making the models more capable. The idea that prompt engineering might become less complex and repetitive as it standardizes makes a lot of sense.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how being at a small startup changes your relationship with AI - using it almost as team capacity extension, especially for after-hours work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we've covered all the main points, it's interesting to see how this all has evolved, since we have been using it in our workplace essentially since the inception of the big models being on the market. It's an exciting time to be working in AI related fields.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from the practical challenges of context limits to the strategic decisions about when to collaborate versus delegate have been incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's particularly fascinating to hear from someone who's been using these tools since the early days - that longitudinal perspective on how the relationship has evolved is really unique. 

Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
