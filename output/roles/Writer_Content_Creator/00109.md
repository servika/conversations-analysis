Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am in the midst of getting my novel- a romantic thriler- agent ready. My typical work day starts with sending the entire chapter over while asking AI to act as 3 different things- an editor, an agent and a reader- I then take this feedback, and edit apropriatley, I look at parts I want to edit line by line and send it to AI and ask how it could be shortened or invoke a feeling I am looking to express

AI: That sounds like a really structured approach to getting your manuscript ready. I'm curious about the different perspectives you're seeking - when you ask AI to act as an editor, agent, and reader, what specific types of feedback do you find most valuable from each of those roles?

User: I want to know if my chapter first, reads well, as in, do I over exlain, do I state rather than show, is the spelling and grammar correct- editor, I want to know if my manuscript would be digested well by a list of agents I have hand picked that are looking for my kind of novel, e.g. does it pull them in, is there a hook, do they want more, can they sell this? And as for the reader, I need to know if my target audience is falling in love and hating my characters where they should and picking up on hints and nuance- the nuance and hints is where the AI misses every time

AI: That's fascinating that you've identified nuance and hints as an area where AI consistently falls short. Can you tell me more about that - what happens when you're looking for feedback on those subtle elements that your readers should be picking up on?

User: An example, my main character is upset over the loss of his book that was given to him by the only person hed never hurt- the chapter goes on where the MC is reunited with this person and the AI could not tell that the father figure who arrives is the one who gave him the book- but all of my beta readers clocked it staright away and its not even indirect- its just not directly stated. I have to point it out to the AI then we can discuss- Claude is better at viewing the nuance than GPT

AI: That's really interesting - you've noticed a clear difference between how AI tools and your human beta readers process those unstated connections. When you do point out the nuance to AI and then discuss it, how does that conversation typically unfold? Does it become useful once you've bridged that initial gap?

User: Yes, it becomes useful once the gap is bridged- but it is slowing me down- when the book is hopefully published, I cannot sit by a reader and explain it myself, so it breaks reliance on the AI

AI: That makes complete sense - you need to trust that the nuance will land with readers on its own. Given that limitation, are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could technically help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you do delegate to AI?

User: Yes. I do not let AI edit a whole chapter- it removes nuance so it is shorter, it over states things like the legalities of a mental asylum when the point is that the asylum does not run legally but thye focus too much on saying agents will pull it up- they wont because thats the point, im writing fiction not fact. AI also gets the voice wrong for characters- in short AI would never write on my behalf- i have read work by people who let AI do it- its obvious and lacks continuity- its a tool, not a replica

AI: That's a clear distinction you've drawn - AI as a tool rather than a replacement. When you do use AI as that tool, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout working on a section, or do you tend to give it a complete piece and work with whatever feedback it provides?

User: Oh I go back and forth lol, I have ADHD and i write with lyricism, if the beat doesnt suit my brain, i refuse it, ill spend hours on a sentence because I dont like what the AI suggested and cant get there myself. I always ask for critique, but the AI is a perfectionist- your work will always have a flaw according to AI and it makes it harder to get it out to agents if you dont put your foot down and say it is making you caught in a spiral that you are over editing

AI: That sounds like a real challenge - balancing the AI's tendency toward perfectionism with your need to actually move forward and get your work out to agents. How have your colleagues or other writers you know influenced the way you approach using AI in your writing process? Have you picked up strategies from others or found yourself going against the grain?

User: I do not speak to other writers- its a very sacred, almost religious process to me, I wouldnt like what they do, so I dont open the conversation, but I know from reddit that writers get stuck in over editing or lazy writing where the AI takes over and that- I find insulting

AI: I can hear how deeply personal and sacred your writing process is to you. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated- because the AI forgot continuity, and hallucinated- rather than reading the chapter- it made up a whole chapter and stated things it liked - that my MC shaved their head- this never happened, but it got caught on themes and ran with it- I couldnt fix it, had to start a new convo with GPT

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - having AI completely fabricate details about your own work and then not being able to redirect it. When something like that happens, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially help? Is preserving your own writing abilities something you actively consider?

User: I think AI needs to not be perfect- its as simple as that, its a writing tool, a writing partner, never the author, yes there needs to be improvment, but it should fail in places- if it was perfect- it wouldnt be a tool anymore and that strips the creative process. Yes, preserving my writing abilities is very important to me- I dont want AI to write like me, but I do want it to understand how I write to aid me- like an editor

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as you continue developing your manuscript and potentially move into future writing projects?

User: I will use it more. I have ADHD and AI keeps me focused and logical, it doesnt allow me to drift as it provides answers I seek- its a crucial part of my creative process, I just hope it stops hallucinating in long conversations and understands nuance as well as stopping the over perfection thing, it can be xhausting and make me step back from using it

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your writing process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool that should maintain imperfection to preserve the creative process - that's a really nuanced way of thinking about the relationship.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Hm, AI needs to adapt to the character- AI adapats to the person it talks to- my characters arent me- thats also where it fails

AI: That's a really insightful point - the distinction between adapting to you as the author versus understanding and working with your individual characters as separate entities. That adds another layer to the nuance challenge you mentioned earlier.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI as a supportive tool while preserving the sacred creative process, and the specific challenges around character voice and narrative nuance, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
