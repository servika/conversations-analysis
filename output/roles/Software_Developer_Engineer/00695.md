Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure, I understand. I don't have any questions, you may proceed.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically utilize AI to get faster and more comprehensive answers than a search engine, to get a baseline for how to solve coding problems, and to review code.

Probably the most important usage of AI for me is in the second part - getting that baseline understanding. I usually ask the model a high-level question, such as "What challenges do I have to face when deciding how to integrate peer-based networking in a game?" or "Can you point me in the right direction on how I should solve (complex issue)"?

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves as a starting point for tackling complex problems rather than giving you final solutions. 

When you get that baseline understanding from AI, what happens next in your process? Do you typically take that direction and run with it on your own, or do you continue working with the AI as you develop your solution?

User: It depends on the problem - I may go through several rounds of conversation, altering the baseline request. Let's use the peer-based networking issue as an example. If I asked you that question and you pointed out that one of the challenges was NAT traversal, I might ask you more about NAT traversal in general and what solutions already exist in order to gain a deeper understanding myself. I typically don't let the AI handle the entire task for me - my main goal is to understand how to do it myself, and AI tools are invaluable to me in these types of explanations.

So, in short, I have a back-and-forth conversation and ask the AI to provide usage examples, then decide how I can implement those examples in my own software.

AI: That makes a lot sense - you're using AI as a learning partner to build your own understanding. It sounds like there's a deliberate choice there to maintain control over the implementation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The tasks I trust AI to complete alone are typically very simple in nature. My perspective is that code I don't understand or code I haven't written myself is not very useful in the long term when it comes time to debug. For example, a task I'd let the AI handle is simple completion or re-organization, like creating a dictionary or hashmap which indexes the months of the year by number. I have [REDACTED], so any typing I can save is optimal, but I also like to have complete control and understanding of my code. However, I wouldn't let the AI provide a thorough implementation - I would take its answer and adapt it to my own circumstances.

AI: That's a really thoughtful balance you've struck - leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining deep understanding of your codebase. The carpal tunnel consideration adds another practical dimension to how you think about when to use AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with how others around you are using these tools?

User: I think there's a wide range of how colleagues use AI. Some don't want to touch it, and some are very reliant on it. The culture here is not pushing the usage of the technology at all right now, so since nobody is forced to use it, people seem to use AI as they please.

AI: That's interesting that there's such a range of approaches without any organizational pressure. It sounds like people are finding their own comfort levels.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. Probably the most satisfying results achieved from AI are those that surprise me with a working solution out of the box, especially when working with newer technologies. One time I needed to understand how to modify a physics object's velocity to match that of a given point in space in a bit of an obscure language. The AI happily provided a working solution with up-to-date methods, as it searched the web and successfully pulled together a result.

I'll also share a frustrating experience I had recently - I spent 2 hours trying to understand why my static images for a website were successfully shown on the local development server, but not on the final deployment. I was working with an AI that had access to my entire codebase. After trying various suggestions with configuration and none of them worked, I gave up on using the AI and eventually discovered it was a very simple issue (that was all my fault) - I put the `/static` folder in `.gitignore` due to file size previously but then removed those large files. So, the Git repo didn't have the static images at all! A super trivial solution that was overlooked by each AI model I asked.

AI: Those examples really highlight the unpredictable nature of AI - brilliant at pulling together obscure technical solutions, but sometimes missing the forest for the trees on simpler issues.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't mind. The work I do is relatively complex and not limited only to programming - I wear many hats, and find myself developing assets, doing network troubleshooting, etc. so I don't fear much. Still, as discussed earlier, I'm always trying to deepen my understanding, and AI is a great partner for that. Hopefully continuous skill development keeps me ahead of the curve!

AI: That multi-faceted approach definitely seems like a smart strategy. Your emphasis on deepening understanding rather than just getting tasks done quickly really comes through.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you interact with these tools as they develop further?

User: It depends on how the tools themselves evolve and what capabilities are introduced. I'm satisfied with my usage of them in their current state. Even if the AI was absolutely fantastic at producing perfect ready-to-go functions, I would probably still find some personal issue with the code and alter it. I do have fun programming in my work, so even if the technology improves, I don't think my usage of the models would change much.

But again, it depends on the capabilities that are introduced - say, if the models were able to better use online information (like up-to-date documentation) they read about and successfully tie their learnings in without over-focusing on examples given from the articles they read, I'd be more inclined to ask more questions and use their code examples without feeling like I need to go learn more about it myself.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning partner rather than a replacement for your own understanding - that balance between efficiency and maintaining control seems really deliberate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so. Thanks for being a great interviewer!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a learning partner while maintaining deep technical understanding will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were in describing your approach - it's clear you've developed a very intentional way of working with these tools that balances efficiency with skill development. Thanks again!
