Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: None so far, please go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Usually for coming up with questions to use on exam prep materials, ideas for in class activities like demos, and other things. I also use it to understand/clarify concepts in the research group that I'm in. AI is mostly used for research or creative tasks

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across both your teaching and research work. 

When you say you use it for research or creative tasks, can you walk me through what that looks like? For instance, when you're working on understanding concepts in your research group, how do you typically interact with AI to get that clarification?

User: If the research papers that I'm looking through uses the phrase 'homolytic cleavage,' then usually I'll either ask ai what it means and to explain it in a way for a college chem major to understand. In my other research group, the things I do are more hands-on, so I ask for the ai to do troubleshooting if my reaction doesn't go as planned or if my yield for a product is low

AI: That gives me a really clear picture of how you're using it as a learning and problem-solving tool. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to read through texts or do question sets on my own, I only really ask AI if I'm in a time crunch and need a more efficient way of doing something

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI more as an efficiency tool when you're pressed for time rather than as a default option.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask it to handle something specific and then take that output and work with it independently?

User: Unless the task is somewhat complicated (asking for troubleshooting tips and following up on a part I want more elaboration on), I usually just ask the ai once and take the results to deal with myself

AI: So it sounds like for most tasks you're getting what you need in one interaction, but when things get more complex - like troubleshooting - you'll have more of a back-and-forth conversation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your research groups or academic environment have particular attitudes about AI use?

User: I'd say my research groups approve the use of ethical AI, although my college as a whole has been kind of mixed. Lately my college is heavily pushing the use of ai in classrooms, but I don't think this is good for all scenarios

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you can see both the potential benefits and the limitations depending on the context.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had to read 3-4 research papers late at night and I didn't really want to comb through the material myself, so I used AI to summarize the findings, intro, results/data, and other parts of the papers in a pretty short amount of time. The AI summarized it pretty well and although I had to manually copy and paste the text into the bot, it was still a bit more efficient than reading the papers myself

AI: That sounds like a really effective use case - getting through a lot of dense material quickly when you needed to. It's interesting that even with the manual work of copying and pasting, it still felt more efficient.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would like to go into medical school, and I doubt AI could meaningfully replace the emotional benefit of having a human doctor vs a robot one. My current jobs are in the research/teaching field since I'm a college student right now, but I don't think ai will take over as quickly vs accounting or data entry

AI: That's a really insightful point about the irreplaceable human elements in medicine. You seem to have a clear sense of where human skills remain essential versus where AI might be more disruptive.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think the way you use it will change as you move toward medical school and eventually practice?

User: I think AI can be a pretty useful study tool in med school in its most basic forms, but I know AI has been developing pretty quickly in terms of diagnostics and mass data analysis, so AI has the capacity to help doctors diagnose conditions and make up treatment plans pretty efficiently

AI: That's fascinating - you're seeing AI both as a personal learning aid and as a potential diagnostic partner in your future practice.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits differently across various fields and your nuanced view of when it's most helpful versus when human skills remain essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing in particular

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an efficiency tool when time-pressed, the importance of maintaining core skills, and your thoughtful approach to where AI adds value versus where human expertise remains crucial will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
