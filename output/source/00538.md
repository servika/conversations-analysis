Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No I'm good to go

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: A lot of my work's AI use is actually quite passive in the background, or at least I don't often ask something from AI in the day to day. A primary use for it is summarising and recording calls, deriving action items from them, and putting together the key points so a rep can quickly understand what the call was about. It's also used to summaris message chains and get a quick understanding for what the customer is asking.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is working more as a behind-the-scenes assistant rather than something you're actively prompting throughout the day.

When you say it's helping reps quickly understand calls and customer messages, can you tell me more about how that actually plays out? What does that process look like from your perspective?

User: So the tool has developed a bit since first being introduced. At first it would generate a short summary after hanging up a call, only once you press a button and request it. Now it generates this automatically based on a live transcript it's recording. The summary also seperates itself into 3 sections being the 'summary', the 'query' and the 'actions,

AI: That evolution from manual to automatic is really fascinating - it sounds like the tool became more integrated into the natural flow of work.

Tell me more about those three sections. How do you or your team actually use each of those different pieces - the summary, query, and actions - in practice?

User: I would say the summary is the most imporant bit and is what I used the most just to get a quick overall understanding of what the customer is referring to. The query is the same although just a bit more concise. The action bit, I actually don't refer to all that often, mainly because being in the role I will already know what the derived actions will need to be. From the point of view of accountability, I prefer to decide the action items myself rather than base them solely on the ai.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using AI to get oriented quickly, but you're keeping the decision-making and accountability piece for yourself.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I would say, although we don't have this tool yet, I especially wouldn't want to leave data input to an AI because there can be serious consequences that come of that if there's a slight mistake. For this I prefer the system of going through it myself then getting it peer-reviewed. When it comes to summarising and researching, however, I'd be comfortable outsourcing that to AI

AI: That distinction between data input and summarizing is really clear - it sounds like the stakes and consequences play a big role in what you're comfortable delegating.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It is definitely a case of collaborating with it rather than delegating complete tasks, so it is more a supplementary tool.

AI: That's a helpful way to think about it - as supplementary rather than taking over entire processes.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I would say because we are strictly an online company, adopting AI is and was quite inevitable, and given that so 95% of our work involves being on the computer and navigating systems.

AI: That makes sense - being fully online would naturally create more opportunities for AI integration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: We have had tried before using an AI tool to create message responses to customers but it was decided that it would  not be rolled out. Having seen it in action, I'd say it is simultaneously satisfying and impressive to see how well the tool can address the customer's needs/queries, but also frustrating, and a bit concerning, given you're loosing the personal service touch.

AI: That tension you're describing is really compelling - being impressed by the capability while also feeling something important might be lost.

When you say "losing the personal service touch," what specifically do you think gets lost when AI handles those customer responses instead of a human?

User: I think as it stands it is very easy to notice AI-like language and 'tone' especially. There is something really to be said for having a human rep on the other side of the conversation. I personally have had experience being very frustrated with AI chat bots on various company websites and almost always ask for an agent straight away. Reason being that the chatbot almost always can only help to certain extent, and can sometimes not see solutions that an agent would, because sometimes those solutions are outside of the typical protocol.

AI: That's a really valuable perspective - you've experienced both sides, as someone who might use AI tools at work and as a customer dealing with AI responses.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am personally a very motivated individual, and I feel I would definitely resist the temptation to let my skills dissipate as AI is used more. If an AI tool can take over perhaps the more menial aspsects of the job allowing me to focus on more advanced areas, then that works for me. But I definitely don't like the idea of losing out on areas to develop and learn because an AI tool is already responsible for that particular job.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI to handle the routine work so you can focus on growth areas rather than letting it replace your development opportunities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will be firmly established as a summary tool. I think we may inevitably see it come back as a tool to help responding to clients' messages, but not where the AI writes the entire message itself; it will be supplementary tool on the side that might suggest edits, a bit like Gram-marly but more advanced.

AI: That vision of AI as an advanced editing assistant rather than a replacement writer is really interesting - it keeps you in control while still getting benefits.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to maintain that personal service touch and your clear thinking about where you draw the line on delegation versus collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution from manual to automatic AI tools, the importance of maintaining human judgment in high-stakes situations, and your thoughtful approach to skill development have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
