Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Mostly I use AI to help write. I have a website for my real estate photography business. When I update pages, I use AI to help write content to drive traffic to my page, to create marketing emails, and write new descriptions for my Google business profile. I also use it to help with fresher reviews for guests at my airbnb. This is almost a daily practice. About once a week, I use AI to help me interpret my Google analytics.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into the marketing and content side of your business. 

When you say you use AI to help write content for your website and marketing emails, what does that process typically look like for you? Are you starting from scratch with AI, or do you come to it with specific ideas already in mind?

User: I'll have a goal and target audience in mind. Since I also used the AI model to help create my website, it has a good idea about my voice and personality, so it keeps things consistent. So it will provide an email or description and I'll ask for tweaks before using.

AI: That's fascinating that you've established that consistency with the AI understanding your voice and personality. 

Tell me more about those tweaks you typically ask for. What kinds of adjustments do you find yourself requesting most often?

User: Most often, it's to sound less like a sales pitch. To keep the communication friendly and casual. The second most common request is to shorten the message - try something that will get read and not sent straight to the trash bin.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - finding that balance between being informative but not overly salesy, and keeping things concise enough to actually get read.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When building or refreshing my website or creating emails, I choose the photos myself. That's the creative side of the business that I enjoy and I have an end goal when I'm taking and editing the photos. Recently, I have found myself screenshotting the finished page and asking AI to critique it, including the images I've chosen.

AI: That's really insightful - you're keeping the creative photo selection and editing as your domain, but then bringing AI in for feedback on the overall result.

When you ask AI to critique your finished pages, including your image choices, what kinds of feedback do you find most valuable? What does that critique process reveal that you might not notice on your own?

User: Sometimes I get caught up in what I was trying to do when creating the photo and being pleased with the outcome. AI has helped put me back on path before by explaining that even though the photo is good, it may not be what a realtor looking for a photographer is looking for. For example, I got a great office shot of a unique room, with a great view outside the window. I traded out my "hero image" for it. When I showed the page to AI, it explained that a realtor isn't looking for an office shot, but more than likely a well-composed street view or a room like a living room where people will gather.

AI: That's such a clear example of how AI can provide that outside perspective - helping you shift from "this is technically a great photo" to "this serves my business goal of attracting realtors."

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Currently it's almost exclusively collaborative. When I learn to use it more, or trust the results more, I will likely delegate things like creating the P&L, tracking expenses, etc.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're seeing a progression from collaboration toward potentially more delegation as your comfort level grows.

What is it about those financial tasks like P&L creation that makes you think they'd be good candidates for delegation, versus the content writing work where you prefer to stay collaborative?

User: The financial tasks are cut and dried. They're either right or their wrong. My voice and vision don't matter in those tasks. For the writing tasks, they still reflect me. It's [REDACTED] photography I'm selling, not AI's. But I do credit AI tools when writing content describing my editing process. Using AI tools is a selling point that lets clients know I'm serious and using the most advanced tech.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - the objective nature of financial tasks versus the personal representation in your writing. It's also interesting that you're transparent about using AI tools as actually being a selling point rather than something to hide.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you run your own business, I'm curious about whether other photographers or small business owners in your network have shaped your approach at all.

User: I am in a small, rural town where 90% of clients and acquaintances still think AI starts with a "hey Siri" command. So when we talk AI, they are fascinated. I've had a couple of realtors ask me to help them get started using models and that asked which models I recommend. So far, everyone has been fascinated about using AI in their work, so I mention it often. There has been no negative feedback from anyone, so I haven't changed approach at all.

AI: That's fascinating that you're actually becoming a bit of an AI evangelist in your community. It sounds like you're in a unique position where you're introducing others to these tools rather than being influenced by existing users.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The most satisfying experience using AI came when I was writing a blog post, explaining the learning process a photographer goes through and how each job done makes me a better photographer for the next job. The post talked about how in-camera mistakes lead to more time spent processing and editing a shoot. After finishing the blog post, the AI's follow-up suggested offering editing services to realtors who didn't hire a photographer. This led to a conversation that resulted in offering a new service and a new revenue stream.

AI: Wow, that's a perfect example of AI not just helping with the immediate task but actually sparking a strategic business insight you hadn't considered. That follow-up suggestion opened up a whole new service offering.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: To me, AI is a tool for those jobs.  Like a calculator, but more advanced. When doing things like tracking expenses and creating a P&L or any finance-related task, I want to see the process, because I want to be confident it's correct. But, like with a calculator, AI goes beyond my expertise fairly quickly. So essentially, if it passes the smell test, I let it go. I'm always interested in learning and building new skills, but there are some things I admit AI does better and I trust it more and more to take over.

AI: That calculator analogy is really insightful - seeing AI as an advanced tool rather than a replacement. It sounds like you're finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while staying engaged enough to validate the results.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think fairly soon, AI will take over the "math" tasks. It's already integrated in my photo editing programs. Eventually those will need less input from me. I see a future where my editing program can access all my photos, learn my goals, what I like and instantly edit my photos in my style. To me, that's a great use of AI. It frees me to do the creative part of the work, either more of it, or to allow myself more time away from work. For what I do, I don't think AI completely taking over the work is in the near future, but it will, and is making it more efficient.

AI: That vision of AI handling the technical execution while freeing you up for the creative work - or more time away from work - sounds really appealing. It seems like you see AI as potentially enhancing rather than threatening your professional identity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that moment when AI's suggestion led to discovering a whole new revenue stream - that really illustrates the collaborative potential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: For me, the tipping point was when the AI models started "remembering" past conversations. It's very helpful when the model knows what I've tried, what I've dismissed, my voice and my goals. The conversation can be productive from the first prompt in a new conversation. There's no stage-setting involved. That ability still has some rough edges, but I'm sure will continue to improve.

AI: That's such an important point about memory and continuity - having that context carry forward eliminates so much of the setup work and makes the collaboration feel much more natural and efficient. I can see how that would be a real game-changer for making AI truly useful in daily work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from finding your voice in AI-generated content to becoming an AI advocate in your community will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me today.
