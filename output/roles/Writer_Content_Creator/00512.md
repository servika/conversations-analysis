Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, that sounds great. Let's start!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't have a fixed routine, but tend to turn to generative AI when looking for ideas or alternative angles on something I am working on. Yesterday, I used Gemini to help prepare a research and marketing plan for a client, told it how I had made a start and what sort of results we were looking for, then gleaned ideas from the timed framework it suggested. I often use Gemini and ChatGPT to come up with answers to historical questions, perhaps from unusual angles. Two days ago, I was reading a book about history from an Islamic standpoint and wondered who among Christians in the UK objected to the spread of a British Empire in the name of Christianity at the time. AI surfaced several relevant names which were unfamiliar to me, and it was useful to ask the AI about their histories and how they are remembered today. I find that AI can be very good at synthesising answers to questions which few authors are likely to have written about (so could be found through search), and I'll get ideas for creative podcast discussions by asking an unusual question like "To what extent is the book of Job about cognitive dissonance?". I don't tend to quote AI answers directly, but AI does give me good ideas for sources to pursue and new questions I might not have thought of. I also use other kinds of AI, e.g. for audio noise reduction or the generation of music and creative ideas for songs, but they might be beyond the scope of what you are looking for here.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI in such a creative, exploratory way. I'm particularly intrigued by how you describe using it to find connections and angles that might not exist in traditional sources.

When you ask AI those unusual questions like about the book of Job and cognitive dissonance, what does that interaction look like? Are you having a back-and-forth conversation to develop the idea, or do you typically get what you need from that initial response?

User: It's usually a back and forth, at least at first. I enjoy chatting in a live mode, often while I'm doing other work or playing a game (this seems to help me think laterally and creatively!) I'll look for answers which surprise me or grab my attention, sparking interesting potential avenues for further research. Once a solidly interesting question forms in my mind which I would like to explore in depth, I may switch to a Deep Research mode for a thorough treatment. A good example of this was in discussion about the critical reaction to the 2025 Snow White film. I had not realised (and I think many critics might not have done either) how fluid and various the original sources of this story were. After initial discussions exploring ideas, I asked for a Deep Research report and found this helpful in putting together a cohesive narrative on the issues, from the range of source stories, through the work of the Grimm brothers to collate and retell them, to the significance of choices made in new retellings over the last century. I would stop well short of saying these answers made me an expert on the topic, but they shed light on good questions to keep pursuing.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - starting with that exploratory, almost stream-of-consciousness conversation and then shifting into deeper research mode when something catches your attention. 

You mentioned you "would stop well short of saying these answers made me an expert." That suggests you have a particular relationship with the information AI provides. How do you think about the line between what you're comfortable relying on AI for versus what you feel you need to verify or develop expertise in yourself?

User: That's an interesting question because "relying on AI" is a sensitive and highly debatable topic. I'm comfy to rely on AI as a source of ideas more than definitive answers at the moment, given that hallucination has been a common issue with LLMs. It's hard to balance the competing needs of novel, creative responses with accurate, predictable ones. I always assume that I should check claims made by AI, especially if my reputation or trustworthiness may be at risk from sharing creative hallucination as fact. In fields where there is no correct answer, such as the generation of imaginative lyrics, stories or poems, I enjoy interacting with AI without a need to fact check! However, as a professional curator of other people's creative work, I'm always feeling the need to gauge how writing or media make me feel and how I expect it to make others feel, so I bring a certain amount of critical judgement in, even where there are no facts to check. Overall, I look forward to being able to interact with AI as with a creative person, not needing to feel that it is any more or less trustworthy than that.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - this idea of treating AI like you would a creative collaborator rather than an authoritative source. It sounds like you've developed a pretty sophisticated sense of when to lean into AI's creative capabilities versus when to maintain that critical distance.

You mentioned being a professional curator of other people's creative work. How has your workplace culture or your colleagues influenced the way you approach using AI? Are you finding that your professional environment is encouraging, cautious, or somewhere in between when it comes to AI integration?

User: I've been a little surprised by resistance to AI input from time to time. For one client, I suggested making a series of songs using AI, demonstrated what Suno and other platforms could do and agreed that this was entertaining, but found that they would prefer not to share this work with an audience. I've also used image-generating AI to make pictures to illustrate talks which would have been difficult or impossible to make physically or find as stock. This has had a mixed reception. Some object to the use of AI in principle, and I suggest to clients serving communities with particular sensitivities to avoid AI use altogether. I've found a mixture of rational and non-rational objections, ranging from beliefs that AI is dangerous, illegally or badly trained, or a threat to humanity in some less easily defined way, to people experiencing the "uncanny valley" effect when images seem almost but not quite lifelike and end up being unexpectedly ridiculous or repulsive. Overall, I find much caution with clients, but this is balanced by their finding that the creativity sparked by helpful AI use can be refreshing and useful.

AI: That tension you're describing is really telling - clients seeing the creative value but still having reservations about sharing AI-generated work publicly. It sounds like there are both practical concerns and deeper emotional reactions at play.

Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation that created that strong reaction?

User: Just over a year ago, I spent a few hours working with generative AI to create an image I knew I would not be able to find in stock (though I tried to find something close!) It was to illustrate the baptism of a character in the biblical book Acts of the Apostles who was striking in the story because they were such a noticeable outsider, partly because they would have been black. I wanted to create the image of a black man who was just under the surface of water but not have the viewer feel that they were drowning or in trouble - instead, the water of baptism was symbolising an old life they were losing and new life that they were receiving. My first efforts showed me how poorly trained some models were to create images of black people - they generally came out deformed, while white and Asian people were much easier to generate in a realistic way. This got me angry, to some extent - not just frustrated because my job had been made difficult, but because of the social implications that some people were simply better served than others because of the ways AI had been trained and used to date. I ended up trying several other AI sources and landed with Midjourney as the best available to tackle this at the time. It felt extremely satisfying to identify (among the dozens of alternatives worked through) an image which produced the feelings I had been looking for, of life and joy triumphing in a visible moment. I would have been just as critical of human photographers or artists trying to convey these feelings, but I felt grateful that the AI process involved being able to try new versions at scale, and I was happy to overlook all of the unsuccessful ones - I just needed one that worked. (By the way, I think this touches on why the common criticism of "AI slop" annoys me - of course there are lots of not quite good enough ideas worked through on the way to producing a really good one. This is the same with people as with AI! We just tend to filter our ideas until we are confident to share them. I see my work with generative AI as being part of the filter, a curator, and I find it disappointing that people get put off AI because they perhaps expect instant perfection. I enjoy the process of not having that at first, and either working towards it or finding something new and better on the way...)

AI: That's such a powerful example - both the satisfaction of achieving that specific creative vision and the anger at discovering those training biases. Your point about being a curator in the AI process is really striking too.

The way you describe filtering through dozens of attempts to find the one that worked - that sounds like a very intentional creative process. When you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over, is this something you actively consider? How do you think about that balance?

User: I expect my skills as a curator to be valued for some time, even though I also value the contribution of AI to help me with curation. For example, when I put music playlists together for clients, I often use Spotify which has been helped by algorithms for years to suggest music that might go well with other music. I need all the ideas I can get, and value when they land near the targets I have in mind. Will AI replace me in this role? Possibly, especially with clients who can't afford me. But I've yet to find the AI that can do what I know clients need as well as I can. When one comes along, which I hope it will, I'll already have been thinking about other ways to put creativity to good use, and will enjoy having more time to do new things that people hopefully also value.

AI: That's such a forward-thinking perspective - seeing AI as expanding possibilities rather than just threatening existing work. Your confidence in adapting to new creative opportunities really comes through.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I currently consider AI tools like partners or helpers, creative staff if you like, but I tend to keep them to myself rather than share them directly with clients. I think this will probably change, as a necessity for transparency as well as out of usefulness for having group interactions that include shared AI tools as if they were team members. Right now, I'm uncertain how possible or welcome this is. It seems hard to rely on AI platforms to maintain a consistent work approach or personality - a model upgrade, as found at ChatGPT, can really unsettle users and undermine the idea of trusting an AI tool like a recognisable person or entity. Despite this, I expect that my asks of AI will increase over time as I find new ways for it to spark or shape ideas, and I hope that AI can develop over time to become more consistent and trustworthy in the areas where it has had historic weaknesses.

AI: That shift from keeping AI as your private creative partner to potentially bringing it into client-facing work is really interesting - especially with those concerns about consistency and reliability you mentioned.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being a curator in the AI creative process and how you navigate those complex client sensitivities around AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not right now, thanks. This has been a really engaging and helpful chat for me. I hope that it's useful for the team too.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about treating AI as a creative collaborator, navigating client sensitivities, and maintaining that curatorial role have been incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been a pleasure speaking with you, and I hope you found the conversation as engaging as I did. Thanks again!
