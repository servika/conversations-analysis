Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

If you're ready, I'd love to start by hearing about how AI fits into your typical workday - what kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Ok, so I'm a primary school teacher in the UK and work in school three days per week. I use AI in lots of different ways in this position - to save time, inspire new actvities for my class (thirty-one 9 and 10 year old children), plan teaching sequences, plan lessons, create slides, create newsletters for parents, draft communications with parents (usually I write out what I want to say and ask AI to check it or improve it). I have also used AI for marking and giving feedback as my class sometimes complete work on Google Classroom, so I copy and paste their work into an AI model along with the mark scheme or what I'm particularly looking for in that piece of work and ask it to check the work and give me positive or encouraging feedback with 'next steps' for the children to work on. I have used AI to create PDF handouts for parent meetings and announcements for our online school Class Dojo, to keep parents informed of upcoming events such as trips. Lots of things really! I also have a second job working for my husband's independent auto-locksmith company, which I do for two days a week. In this role I manage his social media posts and write copy for his website. At the moment we're adding some more services so that we can also offer services for motorcycle keys and eventually, lorry keys too, so I've been using AI to help create copy for new pages on our website.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across such a wide range of tasks in both your teaching role and your work with the locksmith business. I can hear how it's become quite integrated into your workflow.

Tell me more about the marking and feedback process you described. When you copy and paste student work into an AI model with the mark scheme, what does that interaction look like for you? How do you typically work with the AI's suggestions from there?

User: Ok, so most recently, I used it to help me mark a piece of work that that children did based on The Highwayman poem. I wanted them to write a recount of the events, so they wrote diary entries in the role/from the perspective of Bess, Tim the Ostler or one of the Red Coat Soldiers. They wrote drafts by hand and then wrote their final copies into Google Docs on their Chromebooks and uploaded them to Google Classroom. 

When they had finished, I explained our school's marking scheme to Chat GPT, which is quite complicated and time consuming. For each piece of writing, the children receive feedback that encourages self editing and correction - so they get an E1 = [a number], an E2 = [a number], and an E3 = [a number]. 'E' stands for 'Edit'. E1 shows the number of spelling, grammar, punctuation or missing word errors that the children have to find and correct. E2 shows the number of sentences that I want the children to rewrite as they don't quite make sense or work in the context of the writing. E3 shows the number of sentences in their work that I want them to 're-imagine' or add more detail to. 

When the children finished their work, I copied and pasted it into the AI model along with an explanation of the above marking scheme. I gave the AI some information on whether the child was working at, above or 'towards' (below) the age-expected standard for the Year 5 English curriculum - I also told it if the child was working significantly below or any SEN it needed to consider. Some of my class were working at around a year 1 or 2 level, so their work needs to be considered differently. I asked the AI to give me a value for my E1, E2 and E3 feedback for the piece of writing and a short, positive feedback comment too. I also asked for the specific words and sentences that it had recognised as errors so I could double check all the feedback and save notes on each peice before copying and pasting it into the Google Classroom private comments to the child. 

To do this for 31 children can take an entire weekend, and I have other marking and admin to do as well, so AI really helps me to cut this time down.

AI: That's incredibly detailed - thank you for walking me through that whole process. It sounds like the AI is helping you implement a quite sophisticated feedback system that would otherwise consume your entire weekend.

When you get the AI's suggestions for the E1, E2, and E3 values and the specific errors it identifies, how often do you find yourself agreeing with its assessments versus making adjustments? What does that checking process look like for you?

User: Well initially there were some teething problems - it started to remember/pull errors from other children's work when I had moved onto a new piece of writing, so I had to make sure that I was reading the work carefully and that all the feedback was relevant for the piece I was working on. After tweaking my instructions though it was able to give some really helpful assistance. I agreed with the E1, E2 and E3 values probably 90% of the time.

AI: That's really helpful to understand - so you had to refine your approach to get it working reliably, but once you did, it became quite accurate. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it for tasks like marking, lesson planning, and creating materials. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The part I enjoy the most about my job is planning and delivering our 'topic' lessons (history and geography), so while I use AI as a starting point - I might for example upload the UKS2 History curriculum document and ask it to extract everything related to teaching about Ancient Greece and create a set of 8 lesson titles/areas of coverage - I prefer to actually put the slides together myself. I enjoy making Google Slides with a SlidesGo template, so they're visually appealing for my class and follow the exact sequence that I need to in my school. Each lesson needs to follow a specific format: Do Now Task, New Learning, Talk Task, Develop Learning and a Group or Independent Task, so asking AI to write lesson slides based on specfic learning goals, follow the given format, and all within a template that I like seems to be a stretch too far for it. I do however uplaod the slides once I've made them and ask AI to create the written lesson plan, as it's more successful with that and I can just copy and paste it's output into our school lesson plan template.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like you've found a sweet spot where you use AI for the parts that feel more administrative or time-consuming, but keep control over the creative and pedagogical aspects you really enjoy. The distinction between using it to extract curriculum information versus actually crafting the lesson flow seems really intentional.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends really, I use it in both ways. Recently I asked it to create a teaching sequence for our UKS2 pupils on Ancient Greece and it was a collaborative conversation where I added or removed lessons or areas of focus until I had the sequence I wanted. For example, one of the lesson focused on Ancient Greek drama, but I'd like that covered on a museum trip I'm organising, so we removed that part of the sequence. Some lessons I asked for specific activities, like making sure that there was time for debate in the lesson on democracy and asked that links were made to modern-day UK Parliament. This was a back and forth conversation working towards the end goal, so that was super collaborative. 

Other times I might just need an answer key to give to my teaching assistants, so they can tackle some marking while I teach. In those cases I might just snap a picture of the worksheets and ask the AI to provide correct or possible answers that we can use to check children's work with. Usually this is something I'd do for maths, where there's a right or wrong answer.

I've also uploaded some maths teaching slides that were provided by an external provider (Maths Mastery), where I was sure that there were errors in the lesson, and asked the AI to fact check for me. So that was more of a delegation/complete task for it to solve for me.

AI: That's really insightful - you've given me some clear examples of when collaboration works better versus when delegation makes more sense. The teaching sequence conversation sounds quite dynamic, while things like answer keys or fact-checking are more straightforward handoffs.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at your school using it similarly, or have you found yourself navigating this differently than those around you?

User: Well I think there's more and more uptake. I think people were quite cautious of AI to begin with, because it was making a lot of errors, but it's getting much better. The way I see it is that I would check my own work before deciding I'm happy with it or that I'm finished, so there's no different to that and checking AI output. My mum works in education (adult health and social care education) and she was hyper-focused on her students using it to write assignments for her and was over-concerned about plagiarism. Now that I've shown her some ways to streamline her own work, she'd seeing it more positively. 

I would say that I use AI more that my colleagues in my job, I think that I started using it pretty early and as a result, I'm much more confident in it and understand how to write prompts that will give good results. We're a young workforce though and quite a techy school, so opinions are generally becoming more and more positive. For example, in a staff meeting about writing school reports, our deputy head said that it was fine for us to use AI to assist us, and just reminded us to make sure that no child PII was entered into AI. 

I had an AI classroom activity viewed during a a tech showcase that we had, where other schools visited us and visited classrooms to see how we integrate tech into our school, which was praised and apparently talked about with great enthusiasm in SLT meetings afterwards. I had children write their best snowy setting description for their Christmas stories based on Raymond Briggs' The Snowman story and upload it onto our Google Classroom class stream. I then copied and pasted it into Chat GPT and asked it to create images from the child's text. The children LOVED seeing their writing come to life and it encouraged them to add as much detail as possible as I only gave them one go at image generation each. This was a really lovely example of how AI can be used to enhance writing and creativity in a primary classroom and after that, lots of my colleagues have tried doing the same with their own classes.

AI: That image generation activity sounds wonderful - what a creative way to motivate detailed writing! And it's interesting how your early adoption has put you in a position to influence the broader school culture around AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well I think that case was probably the most positive experience I've had using AI in the classroom, the children really loved that. I've taught lessons on prompt generation too in computing lessons, showing the children that details are necessary for good results. In that lesson, we started by writng some really basic prompts that generated generic responses, and gradually added more and more detail until we managed to get exactly what we were looking for. Some children can go with the 'bare minimum' when it comes to writing, so this was a great lesson not only for building computing competancy, but also in extending their descriptive writing skills. 

Some of my more frustrating experiences have been in those quick handover tasks. One in particular involved sending a photo of a spelling word list and asking AI to create a sheet of words/definitions matching cards for me to cut up and give to my children with SEN that can't yet use a dictionary to find definitions themselves. The AI really struggled with this for some reason, but the 'short, one sentence definitions' it provided were good, so I ended up just writing them out myself in the end. The information it gave was good, but it struggled with formatting them into what I wanted.

AI: That's a great contrast - the classroom activity where you taught prompt generation sounds like it worked on multiple levels, both for computing skills and writing development. And I can see how the formatting issue with the matching cards would be particularly frustrating when you just need a quick, practical solution.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As in AI taking over what I do in my job?

AI: Yes, exactly - I'm curious about your thoughts on that. Do you think about keeping your own skills sharp in areas where AI is becoming quite capable, or is that something that crosses your mind at all in your work?

User: I don't think that my job is at any risk in terms of AI taking over. Teaching is one of those uniquely human professions. To be honest, the more admin and paperwork tasks that AI gets better at can only benefit me. I would absolutely love to be able to just plan and deliver my lessons, spend more time on supporting the children's specific needs, pastoral care and exploring new ways of engaging the children in the curriculum. Teachers spend too much time on administrative tasks, so automation and AI assistance needs to be embraced more than worried about in my opinion.

AI: That's such a clear perspective - you see AI as potentially freeing you up to focus more on the core human elements of teaching that you find most meaningful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think this is all heading for you?

User: I think that with more time, and lots of privacy protections/enhancments, AI has the potential to revolutionise teacher workload. I would like to see more AI support in administrative tasks. If we were able to fully trust the privacy settings of AI models, and input children's academic progress so that it could generate IEPs (independent educational plans) or supportive documents for EHCP applications, or school reports based on their learning over the year, we could cut down on a lot of additional tasks. It's already pretty amazing what it can do that we hadn't even thought about 5 years ago, so thinking about what it'll manange in the future is pretty exciting.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI could free up teachers to focus on the uniquely human aspects of education, and your creative example with the image generation activity that motivated your students' writing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI across both your teaching role and the locksmith business, along with your thoughtful approach to integrating it into classroom activities, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and the frustrations, and your vision for how AI could transform teacher workload in the future. Have a wonderful rest of your day!

User: Oops! I meant 'That's all!' :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again - your insights have been really valuable. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
