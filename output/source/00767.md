Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI for help with crafting or interpreting messages (usually emails or texts). I may use it to rephrase part of my message or get clarification on what is being asked. I also use AI for general research purposes about something I am not familiar with or need a more in-depth refresher on. Usually, I use AI as an assistant to help organize and disseminate information.

AI: That's really helpful. When you mention using AI to rephrase parts of your messages or get clarification - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you decide when you need that kind of help?

User: This is usually when I need to respond to someone that I report to in a somewhat formal sense. I will complete the task myself (let's say answer questions in an email) if I can, and then, I'll ask AI to make the email more formal and keep it concise. If there is something I'm not understanding (a word or phrasing), I will ask AI to help me understand and give it context if necessary. I will decide I need help if I feel like something is taking me longer than it should to complete.

AI: That's interesting - you mention using AI when something is taking longer than it should. Can you tell me more about that decision point? How do you recognize when you've hit that threshold where it makes sense to bring AI in?

User: For me, it's somewhat subjective. In general, for work, I like to use AI for more subjective things (like phrasing or rewriting) because I can make the final decision if I want to incorporate the AI's advice or not. If I feel like I'm overthinking a word or taking more than a couple minutes to get my point across, I will seek help. I prefer this over always using AI for objective things (like getting an accurate statistic) because I trust myself more with the accuracy.

AI: That distinction between subjective and objective tasks is fascinating. You mentioned trusting yourself more with accuracy for objective things - can you tell me more about that? What experiences or observations have shaped that preference?

User: I work in sports, so the accuracy of statistics and context is extremely important when I need to apply it to something (say a scouting report). I trust myself to find accurate and relevant information more than AI right now because I know AI models tend to hallucinate instead of admitting they can't find something. I guess I would rather just verify the accuracy of information one time in my research, rather than having to fact check the AI and be on high alert for things that don't look right. I would consider these objectively based tasks that I want to handle with care. Other tasks (like rewriting my own words or interpreting colloquial language), I consider subjectively based. These are tasks where the answer I am looking for may not be one specific thing (like a stat), and I can use my own judgement to check for reasonability, rather than needing to do outside research.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the stakes and verification process are so different between those two types of tasks. In sports, getting a stat wrong could really impact a scouting decision.

When you do use AI for those subjective tasks like rewriting or interpreting language, how do you typically work through that process? Do you go back and forth with the AI, or do you usually take its first suggestion and decide from there?

User: It depends. Ideally, the first suggestions(s) are appropriate, and the task I needed assistance from AI for can be completed shortly after by myself. Other times, I will need to go back and forth with the AI to get a better suggestion or give it more context, so I know it understands my intent.

AI: When you do find yourself going back and forth with AI to get a better suggestion or provide more context - can you describe what that feels like? What's happening in those moments when the AI isn't quite understanding your intent?

User: Sometimes it's frustrating, but sometimes I realize that my initial prompt was not specific enough or accidently conveyed something else. Honestly, if I know I adequately explained my intent with enough context, and the AI is just not helping, I will leave it relatively quickly.

AI: That's a really practical approach - recognizing when to cut your losses. You mentioned that sometimes you realize your initial prompt wasn't specific enough. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about these kinds of experiences with others?

User: So, realistically, every part of my job can be completed without AI. However, I have seen many people have breakthroughs or just leverage AI to where it helps them get tasks done better and more efficiently. It is not required or illegal to use AI, but seeing other people use it successfully makes me want to do it too. Still, I've definitely heard more colleagues talk about AI pitfalls than why it's helpful. I think sharing these experiences (both good and bad) is why the use of AI really varies by individual in my job.

AI: That's such an interesting dynamic - seeing others have breakthroughs but also hearing more about the pitfalls. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I remember I was trying to find statistics on an opposing player for an upcoming game. He was one of their best players, so I just wanted to see if he was hot or cold, and try to find an advantage. I quickly became frustrated because I could tell almost all of the information I was being given was hallucinated. For example, I was asking for their stats from "this month", and I would get stats from years ago or just general information.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you need current, accurate information for something as time-sensitive as an upcoming game. On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying or helpful?

User: I used AI to help create a workout plan for a month, and that was pretty helpful. Rather than having to type everything out and organize it myself, I just gave the AI most of the workouts I wanted with information about how I wanted the schedule to look. I also asked for a couple workout suggestions targeting certain muscle groups to add and got useful information

AI: That's a great example of playing to AI's strengths - the organization and formatting work that would be tedious to do manually. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do often think about AI taking over sports, specifically the players becoming machines. Personally, I don't think AI can ever truly replace athletes and preserve the meaning of "sports." However, I do think the sports world is being so data driven that there are people who will always side with AI instead of their own eyes.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on the broader implications for sports. But I'm curious about your own professional skills specifically - as you continue using AI for tasks like writing assistance and organization, do you ever think about whether you might lose practice with those skills yourself?

User: Oh, I see sorry for the tangent. Honestly, I feel like my skills in those areas are solid enough to get by for the rest of my life, and not everybody is the best with those types of tasks. I like that I can leverage AI to make things easier. I do feel like it is possible to lose practice with any skill because of AI though because you rely on something telling you rather than doing it yourself and remembering.

AI: No need to apologize - that tangent actually gave me interesting insight into how you think about AI's role in sports more broadly!

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll start using it for different types of tasks, or do you see yourself sticking with this current approach?

User: I think AI is only going to improve and become more accurate in the future, so I see myself using AI more for tasks I consider to be objectively based in the future. I hope so at least.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you distinguish between subjective and objective tasks, and how the accuracy requirements in sports influence your approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it. Thanks for the interview!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI's strengths and limitations in a field where accuracy is crucial will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
