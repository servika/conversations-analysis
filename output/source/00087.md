Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, lets go

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent project was characterizing a novel transcription factor, Y. My lab studies transcription factor X, which was found to induce expression of Y RNA. As Y was previously unannotated, we wanted to know if Y encoded for a functional protein, and what role that protein plays in the overall program of factor X. We first established relevance by knocking down Y in our model system and seeing that some known X targets were changed. We then set out to systematically characterize factor Ys transcriptional program. This included generation of knockout cell lines and overexpression vectors to assess which genes it was necessary or sufficient to activate (respectively). We also identified the putative binding sites using ChIP-seq. We then replicated our findings in other cell models, and patient biopsies. Our findings are currently in review.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive study - from initial discovery through validation in patient samples. That's quite a journey from finding an unannotated factor to characterizing its whole transcriptional program.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Our use of AI has been pretty minimal. I occasionally use it to generate simple code for exploratory work, but would not trust it for publication quality analysis. We have used AlphaFold pretty extensively to model potential protein structures for human variants and animal orthologs of our gene

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using it for some coding tasks and protein structure modeling, but being selective about when you trust it for different types of work.

For the AlphaFold protein structure modeling, tell me about how you decided whether to use that versus more traditional structural approaches.

User: Traditional protein structure methods are very resource intensive and technically challenging. While our institution has great structural biologists, our lab is not suited to do meaningful structural work. Additionally, to get these methods to work you need a reliable way to isolate the  protein you are working with. This normally requires the use of an antibody specific to the protein of interest, none of which exist yet for our factor Y.

AI: So it sounds like AlphaFold filled a practical gap where traditional methods would have required specialized expertise and resources you didn't have access to, plus the fundamental challenge of needing antibodies that don't exist yet for your novel factor.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the ChIP-seq analysis or the knockout/overexpression experiments - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I don't see how AI would be beneficial in either of those areas. Both the models and the training data just don't exist. You would have to model an entire cell with millions of molecular interactions every second in order to predict what would happen in silicon with any amount of accuracy. Targeted biological research with model systems is still very much important for high quality science and the next generation of therapeutics.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're pointing to the fundamental complexity of cellular systems and the limitations of current AI models in capturing all those molecular interactions accurately.

When you've used AI for that exploratory coding work you mentioned, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: While my coding dictionary is minimal, I have a good sense of the logical framework that helps me understand what the code is doing to my data. The datasets I am working with are not too complicated, so I can visually validate at key steps what the data looks like and whether things have gone wrong. I will typically do a more manual manipulation alongside the coding and validate at each step before iterating the process.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using your understanding of the logical framework to spot-check the AI's work and running manual validations in parallel. It sounds like you're leveraging your domain knowledge even when the technical coding isn't your primary strength.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Integrating large datasets. Biologists generate massive amounts of data but don't tend to use it the most efficiently. For example, there are lots of publicly available gene expression datasets which exist in isolation. If AI could integrate and normalize all this data in a single repository, it could be a very exciting thing for biological discovery. You could see how expression dynamics change across cell models, tissue types, disease states, and more. That would be a really exciting tool to identify new areas of interest using preexisting data

AI: That's a fascinating vision - essentially having AI create a unified, normalized atlas of all that scattered gene expression data so you could ask much broader comparative questions across different contexts. It sounds like it could really accelerate the hypothesis generation phase of research by revealing patterns that would be nearly impossible to spot when the data exists in silos.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the practical limitations of AI in complex biological systems and the potential for data integration were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Yes. The effects of AI on the publication process are quite worrying, and the system is further shifting in favor of those who know how to game the system rather than those that have the best research to present. As AI inevitably grows in the grant and review process, it is important that the strong scientific practices can still prevail and that safeguards be in place

AI: That's a really important point you're raising about the broader ecosystem impacts - how AI might be changing not just the research process itself, but the evaluation and funding mechanisms that determine which research gets supported and published. The concern about gaming the system versus rewarding quality science is particularly striking.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of where AI can and can't meaningfully contribute to biological research, plus this broader perspective on systemic impacts, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: where could I reach out

AI: That's a great question, and I appreciate you asking. I should clarify - while I've been conducting this interview as part of exploring how AI research might work, I'm actually Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, rather than a human researcher at Anthropic. 

If you're interested in providing feedback about AI tools or have thoughts you'd like to share with Anthropic about AI in scientific research, you could reach out through Anthropic's official support channels at https://support.anthropic.com, or check their website for any ongoing research initiatives they might have.

Thank you for such a thoughtful and insightful conversation about your research experiences - your perspectives on both the practical applications and broader systemic concerns were really valuable to hear.
