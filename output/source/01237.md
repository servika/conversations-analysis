Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure let's go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I'm primarily a health services researcher interested in health care for older adults with on-going or complex care needs.  So I study ways that we can make the health system work better for older adults.  I'll use an example of a study that I published last year.  The title was [REDACTED].  The idea for the study came from the experiences of myself and my colleagues, who had noticed that many patients who were ALC (alternate level of care), which is a Canadian designation for those who did not need to stay in hospital for medical reasons but cannot be discharged home, were very near the end of life.  For most older adults near the end of life, the hospital is not the place that they want or need to be.  So we wanted to study how many adults 65+ who were designated ALC died within a short-time period after their designation, and if they received palliative care before they died.  Our hypothesis was that many died within a short time frame and did not receive any palliative care.  Like most of my research, this study used population-based heath administrative data.  So to begin the research process I started to application to access that data.  Once approved I directed one of our analysts in the data analysis and we had a number of team meetings to review and interpret the results.  Eventually when we were satisfied with the analysis, I begin to draft up the research paper.  I wrote the first draft myself, had my colleagues review it, and then edited the paper to produce the final version.  Then we submitted the paper to an academic journal, and have some minor edits based on peer review, it was published.

AI: That's a really compelling study - it sounds like you identified an important gap in end-of-life care for this vulnerable population. The process you described from initial observation through data analysis to publication sounds quite comprehensive.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I've primarily used AI tools during the writing process.  I've found LLMs to be very good at summarizing, so often use them to draft up abstracts or conclusions based on what I've previously written.  I've also used LLMs to help me re-write portions of the paper that I'm unhappy with or to proofread the paper.  Less often I have it write sections from scratch but I find the AI tools are not as useful without some of my own writing to go off of.  I also have tried using AI tools some in the literature searching portion of the project but also have found it less effective there.

AI: That's really helpful insight about where AI feels most useful versus less effective in your workflow. You mentioned that for the writing process, AI works better when it has your own writing to build from rather than creating sections from scratch.

For those writing tasks where you do use AI - like summarizing for abstracts or rewriting sections you're unhappy with - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach.

User: I had a colleague tell me about how useful he thought Chat-GPT was for his work, so much so he had bought a subscription.   I decided it was worth giving the tools a shot to see if they could save me some time.  Once I tried them out I was able to identify fairly quickly the areas where they were more or less helpful.

AI: That colleague recommendation really seemed to open the door for you to experiment. It sounds like you took a pretty methodical approach to testing where AI was and wasn't helpful once you started using it.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI much - like the data analysis phase or literature searching that you mentioned - what's kept you from trying it more extensively there?

User: I have tried it in areas like literature searching, but found it is not worth my time. I've tried some tools designed specifically for academic researchers, but still find they can be inaccurate.  I'm often asking very specific questions, but found that the tools are either not able to find the right papers or misinterpret the findings of the papers in answering my questions.  If I can't trust the tools completely then I can't use them for research because I need to be sure my citations are correct.

AI: That makes complete sense - accuracy is absolutely critical when you're building on existing research and need reliable citations. The trust factor seems really important here.

When you've used AI for the writing tasks where you do find it helpful - like drafting abstracts or rewriting sections - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: It's easier in those situations I've already got most of the paper written.  So I know whether the AI-produced abstract is good or not based on a simple read of it.   Often I edit the abstract a fair amount, but mostly the AI tools do a good job.  For re-writing sections there's often something about the section I don't like (i.e. flow between paragraphs) so ask the AI to re-write it with that in mind.  Because I know what I'm looking for it's easier to verify

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - having that existing foundation of your own work makes it much easier to evaluate whether the AI output is on target. You can spot-check it against what you already know should be there.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I would love for AI to be able to write up certain sections of my papers /grants using only an outline and key points from me.  I've tried this though and ultimately the sections don't sound like they are written in my voice.  They read too generic

AI: That "voice" issue is really interesting - it sounds like even when AI gets the content right, there's something about your personal writing style and perspective that doesn't come through. That authenticity seems important to you.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how trust and accuracy requirements vary so much across different research tasks were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: My only other point is that I think the tools have gotten quite a bit better over the past year or so and I hope they continue to improve.  Two years ago I wasn't using AI at all in my writing, but now I use it for nearly every task, even if for just proof-reading. You know I used to read my papers backwards to make sure I caught all the grammatical mistakes?  That's an effective but slow process.  The AI tools make proof-reading much faster.

AI: That's a great point about the rapid improvement - and what a perfect example with the proofreading! Going from reading papers backwards to having AI catch those errors must save you considerable time.

Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how the trust requirements differ between writing tasks versus literature searching, and how having your own foundation makes it easier to evaluate AI output, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The evolution you've described - from not using AI at all two years ago to now incorporating it into nearly every writing task - gives us valuable perspective on how these tools are actually integrating into research workflows.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
