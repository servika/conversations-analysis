Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm happy to proceed

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I work as an edit producer most of the time in factual entertainment television. I use it to transcribe rushes and to come up with ideas for voiceover

AI: That's fascinating - working in factual entertainment television sounds like creative and detailed work. 

When you say you use AI to transcribe rushes, can you walk me through what that process looks like for you? How does that fit into your broader workflow as an edit producer?

User: So I will upload a sequence and ask it to transcribe the voices. Sometimes work pays for a speialist service (such as trint or rev) sometimes it doesn't or I need something really quickly

AI: I see - so AI transcription becomes particularly valuable when you need something fast or when the budget doesn't cover specialized services. 

Tell me more about the voiceover ideas part of your work. How do you typically approach that with AI?

User: So with voiceover sometimes I have a creative block so I will ask for multiple lines and then it gives me something to build from. For example, I might ask it for a good end of part teaser and tell it whats in the next part, or I might ask it to write me an intro, or if I am working on a show about a specific location I might ask it to write me some lines about the location with some interesting facts

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI as a creative starting point when you hit those blocks. 

When AI gives you those multiple voiceover lines, what happens next? Do you typically use them as-is, or do you find yourself reworking them significantly to fit the show's style and tone?

User: I always have to rework them, as I have to write them in the voice of whoever is going to do the voiceover or in the style of the show (AI is not good at doing this), but it's helpful to have a script to work from

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using AI more as a foundation to build from rather than expecting it to nail the specific voice or style right away.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your edit producing work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The main part of my job is watching all the rushes and picking out the best bits to tell the story I want to tell, I don't know that AI could help with that yet, if it could I am in trouble! The kind of shows I work on are always about real people (sometimes competition shows, sometimes more factual about an aspect of someones life) and so a human touch is still needed to craft the story. AI helps best for tasks like transcribing or brainstorming to save me time

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the storytelling craft and understanding what makes compelling television about real people seems like it requires that human intuition and emotional intelligence.

When you use AI for those time-saving tasks like transcribing or brainstorming, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a task and let it handle it independently?

User: If it's transcribing I will send a sequence and then wait for it to do it's thing. When it's brainstorming it's much more collaborative

AI: Could you tell me more about what that collaborative brainstorming looks like? How do those back-and-forth conversations typically unfold when you're working on voiceover ideas?

User: So I might say, I am working on an episode of a competition show set in Bath, I need an intro to a part where the group are doing an activity. It needs to give a serious fact about Bath and a fun fact that people might not know. Needs to be about 10 seconds long

AI: That's a very specific brief! What happens after you give it those detailed parameters? Do you find yourself refining the request or asking for variations based on what it gives you back?

User: Sometimes I refine, like sorry that fun fact is not fun enough, sometimes I can take it and it just needs a bit of tweaking

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your production team use it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: I am freelance, so I work for different production companies, but the most recent one I worked at are hiring a person specifically to see how they can incorporate AI into their workflow, not just in the edit but at all stages of production, so I can see that its input is only going to grow

AI: That's really telling - having a dedicated person to explore AI integration across all production stages suggests the industry is taking this seriously.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It makes me feel frustrated often when I'm reading through a transcript and it has got it really wrong. I think there is a big problem with AI understanding different UK regional accents

AI: That's a concrete challenge - regional accents creating transcription errors must be especially problematic when you're working with real people from different parts of the UK.

When those transcription errors happen, how does that affect your workflow? Do you find yourself having to go back and correct extensively, or do you work around it in other ways?

User: I correct it in the transcript as and when I see it. Transcripts are especially helpful when you are trying to use bits of someones sync to create a sentence if they didn't say it clearly the first time and you want to search for keywords to do this. So if it isn't transcribed properly it ends up not saving any time as you have to watch the whole sequence anyway

AI: That makes total sense - if the search function breaks down because of transcription errors, you lose the main efficiency benefit and end up doing the work twice.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't understand what you mean

AI: Sorry, let me be clearer. You mentioned that if AI could handle the story selection and crafting part of your job, you'd be "in trouble." Do you ever think about how to keep developing those core storytelling skills, or is that not really a concern for you right now?

User: It's not a concern right now, if AI gets good enough to do it then I can see how it could save time for some edit producer roles, such as news or sports, but I think with human stories it will always need a human eye

AI: That confidence in the human element for storytelling about real people makes a lot of sense given your experience.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it expanding into other areas of your edit producing, or staying focused on these current uses?

User: At the moment I see it staying as is, but I do think in future it will have the ability to do sync pulls (an edited a version of the rushes where all the non important bits are taken out), but again I think how is it going to know just because there is silence that there isn't a look or something that would be useful to the story, so I don't know how soon this would happen

AI: That's a really thoughtful point about the nuanced visual elements that might not come through in just analyzing audio or basic video content.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you distinguished between the mechanical tasks where AI can save time versus the creative storytelling work that still requires that human intuition about real people's stories.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into the creative television production process - especially that balance between efficiency gains and maintaining the human touch for storytelling - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
