Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I enjoy using to quickly scan information that would take me hours to read or sort through and get a good idea of what is in the information. I like it to summarize things, documents or legalize within the DOD is often too wordy and long and I really just need the quick and easy summary so I can get things into action. I use it to correct grammar or to fix sentences and make it sound professional when I'm running low on brain power/desire to really do multiple things at once. I also have it check things out as a double set of eyes that can catch some mistakes I might have missed. I also use it for sorting information, quick paraphrasing, and formatting for different letters/memos etc that I need to create.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of tasks, from information processing to writing support.

Tell me more about that scanning and summarizing work you mentioned. What types of documents or information are you typically working through, and how does having AI help with that change your workflow?

User: I use it for contracts and CFR ( although it's not good with federal regulations) scanning and assessment. It can go hunt down information within a large CFR or it can summarize the requirements of things. With this, I can move and act fast.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned it's not good with federal regulations specifically. Can you walk me through what happens when you try to use it with CFRs versus when it works well with contracts? What makes that difference for you?

User: It's good at reading contracts, fact checking them, picking out requirements, discerning when requirements are and aren't met. But, you give it a CFR and it's all a mess. With a lot of legal situations many CFR's MIGHT apply, with really nuanced things distinguishing which one actually does. AI cannot distinguish what takes precedence if let's say - two are similar and two maybe could apply but there's no way for the AI to reason between them with the given facts and choose the appropriate CFR.

AI: That nuanced reasoning challenge makes a lot of sense. It sounds like contracts have clearer structures that AI can work with, while CFRs require that kind of judgment call about precedence and applicability that you need to make yourself.

When you're working with these more complex regulatory situations where AI can't make those distinctions, how do you approach the task? Do you handle the entire CFR analysis yourself, or have you found ways to still get some help from AI on parts of it?

User: I might use it to narrow things down but I certainly cannot count on it to make decisions or narrow things down too far. I can ask it to fetch certain CFR regulations when I cite them, I can ask for CFR regulations (any and all) related to xyz but I cannot ask it to do much more than that. I have to do the CFR reasoning, what takes precedence or what is truly applicable myself. It's just a recall tool at that point. Like a little library assistant

AI: That "little library assistant" description is really vivid - it sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where AI excels versus where you need to step in with your expertise.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it for grammar correction when you're "running low on brain power." Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Anything that needs to be truly sincere, from the heart, or with passion I don't trust with AI.

AI: Tell me more about that. What makes those sincere or passionate communications different for you when you're deciding whether to involve AI?

User: AI doesn't treat these the way I will, so I don't trust it. It's that there isn't usually the right arrangement of words, the right level of urgency, and it typically sounds robotic or overly verbose and cheesy.

AI: That really captures something important about authenticity in communication. It sounds like you can sense when something doesn't have that genuine human touch.

When you are using AI for work tasks - like those contract reviews or document summaries - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: I tend to give it a lot of info in a dump, then tell it everything I need (or that , at that point, that I know I need) I revise as needed.

AI: So you do more of a big handoff approach rather than going back and forth. When you say you "revise as needed" - what usually prompts those revisions? Is it that you realize you need something different, or that what AI gave you isn't quite right?

User: When I realize I need something different, in addition or an email pops in wanting changes to the previously requested information.

AI: That makes sense - it's often those changing requirements or new requests that drive the revisions.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that the DOD environment shapes how you approach these tools?

User: Yes, there's specific uses and gatekeeping with it. Very controlled, very specific rules that i can't go into.

AI: I understand - you can't get into the specifics of those controls. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had several spread sheets with buildings, those building managers, contracts handled at that building, and then some other data per building. About 250 buildings, large sheet. The first half was perfect but as it went on it was like it lost interest and the data was incorrect after that point. Almost like a person losing interest. Also I have asked it to create a product before and it would tell me the product would be ready in a month and check back. Instead of working it and providing it immediately.

AI: That spreadsheet example is fascinating - you described it as "like it lost interest" which suggests you could actually see the quality degrading as it went through the data. That must have been particularly frustrating since you had to go back and check everything.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have to maintain them because AI is unreliable in it's data and analysis.

AI: That's a straightforward way to think about it - the unreliability itself keeps you sharp. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see it becoming used more in the databases that I access. Used more for different communications that need to be standardized.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a "little library assistant" for regulatory work, and how you can tell when it's losing quality partway through a task.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Really and truly there are some days the AI is on point and some days I just don't even access it  because its just that bad in replies/quality. You could never say AI has a bad day or is moody...but if you could I would.

AI: That's a really striking observation - the idea that AI can seem to have "bad days" even though we wouldn't typically think of it that way. That inconsistency must make it challenging to rely on, especially when you're working with time-sensitive tasks.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of working with AI - from those nuanced regulatory challenges to the day-to-day variability in performance - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
