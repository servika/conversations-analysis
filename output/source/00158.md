Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great Claude! Let's begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for bouncing ideas and additionally for generating documents. I work in cosmetic product development, specifically in formulation development. I ask a lot of questions in regards to ingredients: their functions, compatibility with other ingredients and suggested use levels. I can use feedback from the AI to plan lab based tasks and experiments in this devlopment work. I also use AI to generate documents such as word documents to report and summarise data I have generated. Finally I use AI to search through folders with hundreds of files to find what I am looking for quickly.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across such a diverse range of tasks in your formulation work. 

When you're bouncing ideas off AI about ingredients and their interactions, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you usually start those conversations?

User: So we might have an ingredient of interest, a particular chemical which will deliver a benefit in the formulation. I will often ask AI whether the ingredient would solubilise in an existing formulation, whether it would have any compatibility issues in an existing formulation and how I may integrate it best e.g. I am looking at lactobionic acid, would this fit into formulation 'XXX' containg x, y and z, what are the suggested use levels and what benefits does this ingredient bring. 

I can also ask it to suggest ingredient for a certain function e.g. these are my formulation ingredients, suggest a suitable emulsifier.

AI: That's really helpful to understand how you're leveraging AI's knowledge base for formulation chemistry. It sounds like you're getting quite specific technical guidance.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your formulation development that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I obviously have practical lab tasks that I have to do myself. Often there may be calculations that I prefer to do myself as it is quicker to type into a calculator and/or excel than into an AI prompt. Writing emails and informal lab reports I prefer to do myself even though AI could do them. Emails I see as a personal expression and dont think should be written by anyone (or anything!) other than myself and informal lab reports may look too formal or scripted if written by AI.

AI: That's really insightful - I can hear how you're making deliberate choices about what feels authentically yours versus where AI adds value.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Definitely collaboration. In the realm of idea bouncing or research, I essentially interview AI and delve deeper into a topic but let it do the database and LLM searches to get me information effectively. When generating reports or documents, I give a good prompt and let the AI do the work independently but then I may edit and adjust to finalise.

AI: That collaboration approach sounds quite strategic - using AI as both a research partner and a drafting tool that you then refine.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped how you approach these tools at all?

User: Big push within my large company to use a specific AI tool (I can tell you the company and AI tool if helpful!). They believe it will save us all time if we can use it productively. My manager also likes using AI to sieve through the 20+ years of files and info he has!

AI: That's interesting that there's an active organizational push to adopt AI tools. It sounds like your manager has found particular value in using it for information retrieval through all those years of accumulated files.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I got a bit frustrated today as the tool was helping with a prediction based calculation. I was asking about a change in pH upon changing an acid concentration in a quite complicated formulation. I thought I would use AI to save time on finding the correct equations to use. It made repeated and quite simple mistakes and contradicted itself. It also did not provide working to get to the values it produced.

When AI gives me a bunch of ideas I can take to the lab I find it satisfying

AI: That's a really telling contrast - the frustration when AI makes calculation errors without showing its work versus the satisfaction when it gives you actionable ideas for lab experiments.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I personally dont believe or worry about AI taking my job. I have hands-on knowledge and expertise and practical aspects of my job that AI cannot replicate. It is more of a time save than anything for me which is great!

AI: That's a confident perspective - viewing AI as a time-saver rather than a replacement. It sounds like you see a clear distinction between what AI can assist with and your irreplaceable hands-on expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will use it more efficiently to save me more time and maximise my output in regards to desk based work

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're strategically collaborating with AI while maintaining clear boundaries around what feels authentically yours, like emails and hands-on lab work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: My workplace only allows us to use one AI model due to confidentiality and it not storing what we share. Also that it integrates into other software we use. I think this is useful for you to know

AI: That's a really valuable point - the importance of data security and integration with existing software systems in workplace AI adoption. That certainly helps explain why organizations make company-wide decisions about which AI tools to use rather than leaving it entirely up to individual preference.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're strategically integrating AI into formulation development - from ingredient compatibility research to document generation to file searching - while maintaining your expertise in the hands-on lab work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the satisfying moments and the frustrating ones. These real-world perspectives are exactly what we need to better understand how AI is actually being used in specialized fields like yours.

User: Thanks and good luck, hope I can help in the future too

AI: Thank you so much! Your insights were incredibly valuable, especially getting that insider view into how AI is being integrated in specialized technical fields like cosmetic formulation. The specificity of your examples - from lactobionic acid compatibility questions to the pH calculation frustrations - really helps us understand the nuanced ways people are working with these tools.

I'd love to have you contribute to future research if the opportunity arises. Your perspective as someone actively using AI in such a hands-on, scientific field is exactly the kind of real-world experience that makes our research meaningful.

Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
