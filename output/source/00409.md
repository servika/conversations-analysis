Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds good, I am ready for your questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: On a typical work day, I use AI for zoom meeting notes. There's a version of it that takes the meeting notes, summarizes it into categories and then breaks out the different tasks based on what we talked about during the meeting. I also use it to help explain difficult ideas to clients. I'll ask it questions and then it helps me write my own response or explanation based on how it explains topics.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI for both administrative tasks and client-facing work. 

When you're working with AI to help explain difficult ideas to clients, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you go from the AI's explanation to crafting your own response?

User: I ask it random questions about topics or clarification and then I will write up my answers in my own words via email etc. to help create a full well rounded explanation.

AI: That's helpful to understand your process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I still prefer client communications to come from myself. It still feels a little impersonal to have communications created or sent by AI rather than me. I want them to feel a personal touch. However, for meeting notes and follow up tasks I much prefer to use AI than use my own notes.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - wanting to maintain that personal connection with clients. 

When you do use AI for work, like with those meeting notes or when you're getting help with explanations, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate and use bits and pieces. Even with the task work, once it generates the notes and tasks I am still tweaking and correcting them before putting them into our CRM software

AI: That sounds like a very hands-on collaborative approach. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have there been any conversations or policies that shaped how you approach it?

User: A few have tried different versions of AI notes via zoom like the internal zoom ones, and some external ones that they have trialed. They told me about it and made me interested in trying it.

AI: So it sounds like your colleagues sharing their experiences helped you get started. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: For this past week's meeting notes, it enhanced my workflow incredibly. I was able to copy paste and edit the notes it provided as well as directly import tasks into my CRM software. It cut minutes off of my post-meeting workflow.

AI: That's a great example of AI really streamlining your workflow. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think maintaining a personal relationship with clients is key. We build deep relationships built on trust.

AI: That focus on trust and personal relationships makes a lot of sense. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different tasks in the future?

User: I think I will continue to utilize it and also use it to keep up with my knowledge. It's helpful to have a tool to summarize difficult topics to you in a readable way. Just recently I used it to help summarize the new effects of the new tax bill that passed - it was a much more efficient way to search it and have it summarized than to do research online and then create my own summary.

AI: That's a really compelling use case - using AI to stay current with complex developments like tax legislation changes.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that personal touch with clients while leveraging AI for efficiency gains in other areas.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that I there will be many fun new and exciting tools that will be created specifically for each industry, and I look forward to trying, and utilizing some in my career.

AI: That's a great point about industry-specific AI tools - it sounds like you're excited about the possibilities ahead.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance efficiency gains with maintaining personal client relationships, and your collaborative approach to working with AI, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
