Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an admin support officer (school secretary) in a UK primary school. My main role is providing admin support to the SEN and Inclusion team department, but also support the wider school. Only a daily basis I use my own ChatGPT or the Copilot that is built into my school Microsoft account to assist with communicating with parents and staff. For example I am often asked to post on social media, and I will use AI to assist me with writing the post. Or I will need to write a difficult or complicated email to staff or parents and I will use AI to help me write the email. I also regularly use AI to brainstorm systems and processes e.g. how can I efficiently get these large number of speech and language referrals out to parents, or for help with coding VBA projects on microsoft office, low code for power automate, or using excel.

AI: That sounds like you've integrated AI into quite a variety of tasks! I'm particularly interested in how you use it for those communications with parents and staff.

When you're writing those difficult or complicated emails, can you walk me through what that process looks like for you? How do you typically work with the AI to craft those messages?

User: I will write what I think is a basic post. e.g. We are holding a coffee morning for SEN parents next Monday at 9am. No need to book, just pop in." Then ask Chat GPT to rewrite it for me. It will then give me a slightly more polished post, normally with relevant hashtags and emojis. I then amend it slightly so it sounds slightly more like me or with colloquial language (like cuppa) and post it on Facebook.

AI: That's a really clear workflow you've developed. It sounds like you're using AI as a starting point but then making it your own voice at the end.

Tell me more about that final step where you adjust it to sound more like you. What kinds of changes do you typically make to get it from the AI version to something that feels right for your school community?

User: There are many people in my school community for whom English is a second language or have a low reading age. I therefore don't want to have too complicated language or too many words. It needs to be clear and concise. Most facebook posts need to be slightly informal.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're really thinking about your audience and making sure the message lands well with everyone in your community.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to write my own content from scratch, THEN have AI adjust it, then refine it again myself. I think it sounds more natural and more like me that way. I read a lot of emails from parents who have used AI from scratch to write their emails and I can tell! I also have colleagues use AI to create posters for events and although they are ok for what they are being used for (a quick informal coffee morning or charity fundraiser) I can always find something wrong with the posters. The events I deal with are for advertising the school to new parents (and therefore need to be spot on professional) or parents who have literacy needs and the information needs to be precise.

AI: That's a fascinating insight - you can actually tell when parents have used AI from scratch for their emails. 

What specifically gives it away? What are the telltale signs that make you think "this was written by AI"?

User: Sometimes it's because I have an existing relationship with the parents, I know they are, for example dyslexic and they normally write 2 sentences. So when they email a 10 minute read, it doesn't fit their usual style. But Normally its because the email is full of waffle that is not relevant, and it's full of language and phrases that you wouldn't normally have in a email to a school office.  There are a few em dashes thrown about too!

AI: Ha! The em dashes are such a specific detail - I love that you've noticed that pattern.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you have that three-step process with the social media posts, but I'm wondering - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: I always complete it independently. No collaberation.

AI: That's interesting - so you're very much in control of the entire process from start to finish.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your school using it similarly, or do you approach it differently than they do?

User: I have colleagues, including the senior management team, who use AI for writing long emails. I can always tell! But even though it's obvious they are written by AI, it is appropriate. I know that some teachers use specific teacher based AI for writing lesson plans. I don't know the details for this, just that it's widely used.

AI: It sounds like there's quite a bit of AI use happening across your school, even if people are approaching it in different ways.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was given a very long list of students and dates for their EHCP annual review meeting in a random text format order. I wanted to put them in date order, and with a specific date format, and also two weeks before the meeting date so I knew when to send out the paperwork. ChatGPT did all of that in a few seconds, and this was very satisfying.

AI: That sounds like a perfect use case - taking what would have been a really tedious manual task and getting it done in seconds. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am a little bit concerned that the small coding skills that I have will disappear when I use ChatGPT instead, but I am also more likely to try and code as I now have help and therefore I am more likely to learn more anyway.

AI: That's such a thoughtful balance you've struck - being aware of the risk but also recognizing how AI might actually expand what you're willing to try.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Yes I do. Our main communication system with parents, Arbor MIS, already utilising AI in their commucation section, but it isn't as good as ChatGPT, but I know they are improving. I am also willing to learn more about it to enhance my skills.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being able to spot AI-generated content and how you've developed that three-step process to maintain your authentic voice while still benefiting from AI assistance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I am worried about sharing confidential details with an AI about my students who have medical and special education needs. I am also concerned about HR confidential details about staff medical issues and disabilities  being shared with AI

AI: That's a really important concern you've raised - the confidentiality aspect is such a critical consideration in your role, especially given how sensitive the information you handle is.

How do you currently navigate that? Do you find yourself avoiding AI for certain types of tasks because of those confidentiality concerns, or have you found ways to work around it?

User: I do generally avoid this. I sometimes use the child's admission number rather than name if I'm uploading data onto AI.

AI: That's a smart workaround - using admission numbers instead of names when you do need to work with data.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining authenticity, spotting AI-generated content, and navigating confidentiality concerns will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. You've given us a really valuable perspective from the education sector.

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Thanks again for participating - your insights were really valuable and I appreciated how thoughtfully you approached all the questions. Have a great rest of your day!
