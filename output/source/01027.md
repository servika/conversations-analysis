Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me! No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI daily in my typical workday, but I do use AI quite often to create content. I'm an educator, and I often need to come up with texts (of various lengths) and accompanying questions for different grade levels. This can be very time-consuming, and it's often hard to come up with original ideas. AI makes this task a lot easier and saves me a lot of time.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application. When you're creating these texts and questions for different grade levels, what does that process typically look like for you when you're working with AI?

User: I'll usually have a topic in mind already, and I'll usually already know the basics of what I'm looking for (ie four paragraphs, six multiple-choice questions, a text about a talking bear, etc.). I'll typically start with a request such as, "Give me a four paragraph short story at a 5th grade reading level about a talking bear. Then, give me six multiple-choice questions about that short story." From there, I will ask for revisions to make it more in line with what I need.

AI: Tell me more about those revisions. What kinds of changes do you typically ask for to get it more in line with what you need?

User: I often have to say things like, "Use more grade-level appropriate vocabulary" or "Please make sure that all of the correct answers are not C." I find that the texts are usually either too easy for the grade level I am requesting content for, or too challenging. The correct answers aren't usually varied either- for example, in a six question "quiz", five of the correct answers might be C. Also, the texts tend to have similar character names, so I usually have to ask for a different name to be used to avoid providing similar content to my students.

AI: That's really interesting - those patterns around vocabulary level, answer distribution, and repetitive character names. When you have to make these kinds of revisions, how does that feel? Does it change your experience of working with AI for these tasks?

User: Since I don't usually give a lot of specifics in my first prompt, I anticipate having to make some revisions after I read through what the AI has produced. But it can be a little frustrating at times if I ask for a change in vocabulary level or overall complexity and the AI just gives a different story that's mostly at the same level as before.

AI: That sounds like a pretty common frustration. Given that you know you'll likely need to make revisions, I'm curious - are there certain tasks within this content creation process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I will choose character names myself sometimes so I can make sure the names are unique and not names that my students have already seen in my recent content. I'll also change vocabulary words myself sometimes if the AI wasn't able to make the text an appropriate level for my students.

AI: When you do make those vocabulary adjustments yourself, what guides your decisions about which words to change? How do you know what's going to work better for your students?

User: Experience and time in the classroom. For example, I know that a kindergarten student likely wouldn't know the word "particularly" and in that case, I can just replace it with a better word on my own. I wouldn't necessarily need AI to do that for me unless it was a long text that had several such instances.

AI: That classroom experience sounds like it gives you a real advantage in knowing what will work. When you're using AI for these tasks, would you say you're more collaborating with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle and then review the results?

User: The latter. I don't usually have the time to collaborate in that way, and so I usually just need quick results.

AI: That makes sense given your time constraints. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about AI use with other educators?

User: Yes, in my workplace, we are often encouraged to use AI to help create content. From speaking with friends outside my workplace, I know that is not the case in all schools though. Sometimes it seems as if teachers are viewed as "lazy" if they use AI, even though it has a lot of potential to help make teaching a more manageable and sustainable profession.

AI: That difference in workplace attitudes is really striking. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A good example would be when I needed to find or come up with a long passage for my students to read. I couldn't find one in our approved resources that they hadn't already seen, so I asked AI to create one for me (with specific guidelines). I ended up being pretty satisfied with the results, and it really saved me a lot of time because I otherwise would have had to keep looking for approved resources, or create a long passage myself.

AI: That sounds like a really successful use case. On the flip side, thinking about areas where AI could potentially take over - how do you think about maintaining your skills in content creation? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's not, because I often create content. Teachers are constantly creating resources, it can just be very time-consuming. I'm not worried about losing that skill because it's still something I would do often without AI. AI would just help in situations where I cannot create my own because of a lack of ideas or time.

AI: That perspective makes a lot of sense - using AI as more of a supplement when you're stuck rather than a replacement. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to be able to use AI in other ways in the years ahead. Content creation is a use that has been deemed acceptable in my workplace, but I hope that in the future, AI can also be used for things like grading student responses and communicating with families and stakeholders.

AI: Those are some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a practical time-saver when you're facing constraints, while still maintaining your core creative skills as an educator.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of! I feel like we covered how I use AI in my work and what I hope to be able to use AI for in the future.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a practical supplement in education - especially around content creation, the revision process, and navigating different workplace attitudes - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
