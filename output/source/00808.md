Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No. Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a teacher and multi-classroom leader. I have hours set aside for prep time during the day. 1. I use Ai to generate additional questions for curriculum content. I can generate multiple questions be feeding it an example and asking for a different question with the same mathematical structure but different context and numbers. 2. I use it to speed up certain tasks. For example I also need to do a lot of data entry. If a task or document cannot easily be copied I use it to read it for me. 3. I have used it to speed up lesson planning. I still go through my lesson plans with a fine tooth comb but if I can generate a basic plan to work off that help speed  up the process. 4. I use it to help other teachers generate their own sub plans and worksheets. It is useful for creating one page tasks that explain the concept to others while providing practice problems. 5. I used it to learn tips. I spend a lot of time in excel/sheets and I am always looking for shortcuts to use better formulae and hyperlinks.   6. I haven't recently encourage students to use 'study and learn' or 'guided learning' to meet their own specific learning needs.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses - it sounds like you've found AI helpful across many different aspects of your teaching role.

I'm particularly curious about something you mentioned. When you generate those basic lesson plans that you then go through "with a fine tooth comb" - what specifically are you looking for or changing when you review them?

User: The lesson plans are usually bland, they are generally well structured but drab. I love to get to the heart of what we are learning and why. I want students to be excited. Sometimes the structure does not quite make sense so I have e sure it is sequenced well. Sometime it provides ideas for videos but does not provide the video. Sometimes the lesson just needs to be more interesting

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're using AI as a structural foundation but then adding your own expertise to bring the personality and engagement to the lesson.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes,

AI: Tell me more about that - which tasks do you prefer to keep for yourself?

User: Whoops, I pressed the button by accident! I make the slideshows, it has be have my own and personality in it and often we refer back to things we have done previously. I make video lesson guides, I can't image having AI do that anytime soon. Students engage with a personal relationship they have with their teacher and that will always be more inviting. Human health is based on human social connection and as we move forward we need to recognize that. I would love AI to save me lots of time entering and organizing data but deep discussion needs to be between student and teacher. For example, I would love to have AI teach the mechanics of calculating the mean, median and mode, but for me to take a dive into the conceptual understanding of these terms and why one is more meaningful in different contexts, how they can be interpreted (and misinterpreted) etc.

AI: That's a powerful distinction you're making between the mechanics and the deeper conceptual work. It sounds like you see a clear line between what AI can handle efficiently and where that human connection becomes essential.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will collaborate with it if I am making a worksheet, I will keep suggesting adjustments with a canvas until it gets stuck and I take over to perfect it. A lot of the time it is a single query and done, for example, if I am just looking for sheets formula.

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like you adapt your approach based on the complexity of what you're working on. The worksheet example with back-and-forth adjustments versus the quick formula lookup.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Teachers are afraid and see AI as a threat. They see it as a tool for cheating. They are aware of the power for learning but most students think it is just a shortcut or cheating tool. We have taught them how  counterproductive it is to just plug a prompt in and take the first answer without review but the students do that all the time. Generally it is seen by teachers as a headache

AI: That's really telling - it sounds like there's quite a disconnect between how you've found AI useful and how your colleagues view it. The concern about students using it as a shortcut without critical thinking seems particularly challenging.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I never felt frustrated because I always see it as a work progress, I already know how to do many of the things I am asking it to do but I am just trying to save some time by finding ways it can do the boring stuff. Whenever I see a new development that works in my favour, it can be quite exciting. For example when I started exploring the 'study and learn' tools I got obseessed and taught myself a whole bunch of new math concepts, I was messing about with laplace transformations until deep into the night

AI: That excitement about discovering new capabilities really comes through! It's fascinating that you ended up going down that rabbit hole with Laplace transformations - sounds like the learning tools sparked your own curiosity as a learner, not just as a teacher.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: To be an expert you need to know a thing well, you will never be able to pretend to be an expert on anything that you always delegate. However, that delegation could prove essential when time is not on your side. If I find a skill interesting I will learn it inside and out, but if I don't I will find a shortcut. Most people claim to dislike math but that's because they don't understand it, if they did they would have access to one of the most profound insights available to human consciousness. You can't get that if you don't want to learn. however if I understand the data that I am producing for the classes, I am absolutely looking for something I can use to clean up the process so I can get the information and excel at providing quality instruction where and when it is needed.

AI: That's a really thoughtful philosophy - the distinction between skills you find intellectually compelling versus the more mechanical processes you're happy to streamline. Your point about math being profound when truly understood really resonates.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I need it to save me a lot of time, inputting data. I want to be able to explain what task I need it to do and it does it for me. For example changing the same details on multiple sheets tabs is long a laborious, the hyperlinking to individual documents an absolute pain. Imagine I could say 'change cell x to'........' on all of these documents in a single command, how great would that be. If I want all of my slideshows to have a page 3 with 'this title' now and it was done etc.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between using AI for efficiency while preserving the human elements that make teaching meaningful - especially your point about deep conceptual discussions needing that teacher-student connection.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I sort of covered this but its essential we find a way for students to find a way to benefit them instead of the current trend. We need to figure systems to ensure academic integrity fast, because, I do also agree, that it can be frightening to see students be pulled in lose so much precious time abusing and being abused by technology.

AI: That's such an important point to end on - the urgency of helping students use AI as a genuine learning tool rather than just a shortcut, and finding systems that preserve academic integrity while still allowing them to benefit from the technology's potential.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between efficiency and meaningful human connection, and especially your concerns about helping students develop a healthier relationship with AI, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
