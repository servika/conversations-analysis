Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No that sounds fine

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I occasionally use it to help me build simulations for slot machine games I am designing or to improve simulations I've already built. I do my programming in C# so all of this is in C#.

AI: That's fascinating work! You're designing slot machine games - that sounds like it involves some complex probability calculations and visual elements.

When you say you use AI to help build or improve these simulations, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? What specific parts of the simulation development do you turn to AI for?

User: I've used it to improve the handling of line payout calculations to make sure there aren't mistakes with lines because previously I was using a complicated series of if then statements. I've also used it to help me with certain features I was struggling with how to program like cascading or other features. I've also used it to help with parallizing simulations to make them run faster.'

AI: That gives me a really clear picture of the technical challenges you're working on. It sounds like AI has helped you tackle some pretty specific programming problems - from cleaning up complex conditional logic to implementing advanced features and performance optimization.

I'm curious about your decision-making process here. When you're working on these simulations, how do you decide which parts to tackle yourself versus which ones to bring to AI for help?

User: I tend to prefer to start programming it myself and then if I can program it myself I will ask an AI if there are any suggestions it has for improvements. If I am stuck for a while and don't know how to handle programming it myself and my colleagues also do not have good suggestions then I will ask AI.

AI: That's really interesting - so you have this kind of hierarchy where you first try yourself, then check with colleagues, and AI becomes the next resource when you hit a wall.

Tell me more about that middle step with your colleagues. What does that process look like when you're trying to solve a programming challenge together before turning to AI?

User: There is only one other mathematician I work with so if I feel like he might have handled a similar problem in the past I'll ask him how he handled it before.

AI: Got it - so you have this mathematician colleague who might have tackled similar challenges. 

When you do end up working with AI on these programming problems, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate back and forth with it throughout solving the problem, or do you tend to give it the complete challenge and let it handle it independently?

User: It depends on exactly what I'm asking but normally it tends to be collaborative. I'll ask it the question and give what I already have and then ask how to fix an issue that I'm having trouble with. I will then go through its code to make sure it works and doesn't have any bugs and if I do find bugs and I cannot easily fix them on my own I'll ask the AI to fix them and give information about what I've already done to try and fix it

AI: That's a really detailed look at your collaboration process - it sounds like there's quite a bit of back-and-forth verification and debugging involved.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? For instance, are there any expectations or attitudes about AI use in your environment?

User: My bosses and others on my team tend to be AI positive. They don't say we have to use it but they have suggested using it for certain tasks so I have no problem using it for tasks that don't involve passing any sensitive information.

AI: That sounds like a supportive environment for AI use. You mentioned being careful about sensitive information - that's a thoughtful consideration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Cleaning up the code for handling line pays and pays in general by replacing all the series of if then else statements with a cleaner method of handling it by using list of list for payouts and making it much more difficult to make mistakes when using the code for future games.

AI: That sounds like it was a really satisfying outcome - taking something that was error-prone and making it much more robust for future work. 

What specifically about that experience made it feel so satisfying? Was it the cleaner code itself, or something else about how the process worked out?

User: It was a combination of the cleaner code and the process. The AI did make some small mistakes but I was happily able to find the mistakes and get the AI to correct the issue relatively easily.

AI: That's a great example of effective collaboration - it sounds like you felt in control of the process even when the AI made mistakes.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: While AI can take over building the simulation parts to some extent I think that it will always be a tool a trained mathematician uses. I do think its important to maintain those programming skills so I can aid the AI in those steps.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - viewing AI as a tool that enhances rather than replaces your mathematical expertise, and recognizing that your programming skills actually make you more effective at guiding the AI.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I do think AI will become increasingly prevalent in definitely the simple coding aspect of my job but also potential in some of the creative aspects with coming up with ideas for bonus games or other game features based on parameters it gets fed.

AI: That's interesting - so you see it expanding beyond just the technical implementation into more creative aspects of game design itself.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a tool that complements your mathematical expertise rather than replacing it, and your systematic approach to collaboration and verification.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you integrate AI into slot machine game development - from the technical debugging process to thinking about future creative applications - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining your core expertise. Thanks again!
