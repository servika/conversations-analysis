Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: All good. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For copywriting, I use it for research, if I want to find synonyms or check my phrasing, if I'm stuck on what I'm trying to describe, and more generally, for a second perspective on communication with clients/business decisions. For screenwriting, I use it heavily for research. For example, if I want to find out about a particular industry in detail and have specific questions. I also use it for business strategy. For example, targeting new markets, cold email planning. It is also helpful for contracts and legal queries.

AI: That's a really wide range of applications. When you mention using AI for research in screenwriting - like learning about a particular industry - how does that process typically work for you? Do you come to AI with specific questions already in mind, or does the conversation help you figure out what you need to know?

User: I think it works both ways. Sometimes I'll have a scene in mind and need more information to make it true to life. My most memorable example is I was writing a scene in police custody and I wanted to know the exact questions the custody officer would ask the arrested individual. The questions the AI gave me sparked my creativity and allowed me to write a dramatic scene that was authentic and also leant into my character's personality. Other times, I'll ask more generally about an industry. For example, "What is a typical day like for a social worker?" The AI's answer then allows me to come up with more questions and find out more information off the back of this.

AI: That police custody example is really fascinating - it sounds like the AI didn't just give you factual information, but actually sparked creative ideas for how to use that authenticity in service of your character development.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: To clarify, I didn't tell the AI anything about my character. It was its knowledge of the specific custody questions that allowed me to select what was most relevant to my character and the plot. I actually don't like when the AI makes creative suggestions as I want to do that myself. I purely use it for research. I think what makes the creative tasks different is that they feel personal so I want to use my own experience and writer's voice.

AI: That's a really important distinction - you're using AI as a research tool to gather raw material, but keeping the creative interpretation and voice entirely your own. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Typically, it's very collaborative. I ask a question and then follow up based on its answer. When you say delegate a complete task, could you give an example?

AI: Sure - by delegating a complete task, I mean something like asking AI to "write a full marketing email for this product launch" and then using what it produces with minimal changes, versus working back and forth where you might ask for research, then ask follow-up questions, then maybe ask it to help refine specific phrases based on what you've learned.

It sounds like you lean much more toward that collaborative, back-and-forth approach rather than handing off entire deliverables?

User: Ah, yes. It's 9/10 collaborative. I have asked it to write me a cold email template before though. But then I will ask for amends.

AI: That makes sense - even when you do ask for something more complete like that email template, you're still staying engaged in refining it rather than just taking it as-is.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I am an independent contractor so don't have colleagues, but a producer I've worked with mentioned using AI for visuals which is something I would like to explore as I create visual treatments for music videos.

AI: Interesting - so you're operating pretty independently in terms of your AI usage choices, but that producer's mention of visual applications opened up a new possibility for your work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was very satisfied with the police custody example. I had already tried to find out the custody questions via search engine with no success, so it was a relief to be able to access them. Then, I was elated when I was able to create a strong scene with them. I do find that the AI oversteps with creative suggestions, even when I let it know I'd like to stick to research, and that can be frustrating.

AI: That frustration with AI overstepping into creative territory when you've specifically asked for research - that sounds like it happens fairly regularly for you. When that happens, how do you typically handle it? Do you redirect it in the moment, or do you just filter out those suggestions yourself?

User: A bit of both, but if it keeps happening I'll redirect it for sure.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think I just have to be willing to pivot, keep learning, and offer that human touch!

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will keep using it for research and problem-solving, and I think I could utilize it further for growing my business.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear boundary between using AI as a research tool while keeping the creative work entirely in your own voice - that seems like a very intentional approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's everything I can think of.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that collaborative research approach, and how you maintain those creative boundaries, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
