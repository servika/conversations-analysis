Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I'm ready to start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me fleshout ideas for research projects. I mainly use it to help me brainstorm. There are some times where I have had it assist me in writting R scripts because I don't actually know R.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI in a couple of different ways there. 

When you say you use it to help flesh out ideas and brainstorm for research projects, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I usually have the basis of a research project in mind. I have thge AI suggest different avenues that I could focus the research into for specific aims. If I like some of the ideas I will do additional reading to make sure it fits into my initial research ideas.

AI: That sounds like a thoughtful approach - using AI to generate possibilities and then doing your own validation. 

Tell me more about how you decide which of the AI's suggestions are worth pursuing with additional reading. What makes certain ideas stand out to you as promising?

User: If it is something that I have com across before but maybe didn't realize that it fit into my project. I also think about which ideas are most feasible to do with the experitise I have.

AI: That makes sense - recognizing connections you might have missed and being realistic about your capabilities. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think AI could help me read papers but I find that I don't commit other peoples research into my memory unless I read the papers myself. I also want to make sure that any ideas that I develop are largely my own so I do the validation and fine tuning of project aims on my own.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - the difference between getting help with generation versus wanting to retain ownership of the learning and validation process.

When you do use AI for work, like with the brainstorming or R scripting, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it something to handle and then work with what it gives you?

User: I go back and forth with it because I find that the AI doesn't always fully understand what I was asking for. I take into account the response and fine tune my next prompt input to get more of what I really wanted from the AI.

AI: That iterative approach sounds like you've developed a pretty refined way of working with it. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it, or have there been any particular attitudes or policies that have shaped how you approach using it?

User: I actually started using AI to write R scripts because a coworker that had recently used R mentioned that she usually used AI to trouble shoot her code. I would say not a ton of people use it but there is generally a push for it to be adopted.

AI: Interesting that you picked it up from a colleague's practical tip about troubleshooting code, and there's this broader institutional encouragement happening too.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think any time that I have the AI write code it can be frustrating because it never gets it right the first time. I do a lot of troubleshooting and end up finding that it didn't fix the parts I previously told the AI that it had coded wrong. However, once the script is validated and working it feels pretty satisfying to have the final product.

AI: That cycle of frustration followed by satisfaction sounds pretty intense - especially when it keeps making the same mistakes you've already pointed out.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that there is strength in still knowing how to do things even if AI can do it. I could have AI summarize scientific papers for me but I feel that I would start to lose the skills needed to read that type of literature. Therefore If I already have the skill I tend to utilize it rather than have AI do the task for me.

AI: That's a really deliberate approach to skill preservation. It sounds like you're making conscious choices about where to maintain your own capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that AI will be more common place. I think that it will allow me to handle a larger amount of data or projects with greater ease.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being intentional about preserving skills you already have while using AI to expand into areas like R coding where you're building new capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that balance between using AI as a capability extender while being deliberate about maintaining your core research skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your approach with me today!
