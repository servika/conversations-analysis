Assistant: 

Hello! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

To get us started, could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI rather frequently in my day to day work. Mainly for drafting emails and reports, as well as debugging issues for excel formulas, r or python. I sometimes use it to search for simple issues such as what does certain terms means in insurance context.

AI: 

It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your workflow across different types of tasks. When you use it for drafting emails and reports, what does that process typically look like for you? Do you start with a blank slate and have AI create the first draft, or do you usually begin with your own outline and use AI to help refine it?

User: I usually start with a blank slate, describing the context in 2-3 liners, and then obtain the first draft from AI. I will make some edits to the draft provided to ensure full content coverage, and then get AI to refine and proofread it.

AI: 

Interesting - so you've developed a kind of iterative process with AI. When you're making those edits to ensure full content coverage, how do you decide what the AI missed or what needs to be added? Is it usually specific details about your situation, or are there certain types of content that AI consistently seems to overlook?

User: Specific details about my situation, which the AI did not get right on the first instance.

AI: 

I appreciate you sharing that context. For this user research interview, I realize I should clarify which AI tools you're primarily using in your work - are you mainly using Claude, or do you work with other AI assistants as well? This will help me better understand your specific experience for our research.

User: microsoft

AI: 

Got it, so you're primarily using Microsoft's AI tools - likely Copilot or other Microsoft AI features integrated into your work environment.

Now, I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it for emails, reports, coding help, and terminology searches. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't think there is any, I'm fairly happy for AI to handle more task if they are capable off it

AI: 

That's a really open perspective toward AI assistance. Since you're comfortable having AI handle more tasks, when you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For instance, with those emails and reports we discussed - are you more likely to collaborate with the AI throughout the entire process, going back and forth, or do you tend to give it the initial context and let it handle most of the work independently before you step back in?

User: back and forth most of the time, to ensure the content is satisfactory

AI: 

That collaborative approach sounds like it works well for you. I'm curious about how your workplace environment factors into this. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? For instance, are most people in your organization also using these Microsoft AI tools, or are you more of an early adopter?

User: Majority of my colleagues does use AI to some extent for the same purpose.

AI: 

It sounds like AI adoption is fairly widespread in your workplace. That collaborative environment must make it easier to integrate these tools into your routine. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation that created that strong reaction?

User: AI performs email drafting tasks fairly well, concise and in professional tone. When it comes to report drafting, it can sometimes misunderstand the requirements, hence works better only focusing on paraphrasing the content rather than starting form scratch, which can be slightly annoying sometimes. Most frustrating is when AI comes in to help write a code or debug and issue, it says that the issue would be fixable with a certain code, but the issue still persists.

AI: 

I really appreciate you getting into those specific examples - that gives me a clearer picture of where AI excels and where it stumbles for you. That coding and debugging frustration sounds particularly annoying, especially when you're told something will work and then it doesn't.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really concern you given your current experience with these tools?

User: not concerned for now

AI: 

That's a practical outlook. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it in the same ways you do now, or do you anticipate changes in how you might work together as the technology develops?

User: Hopefully AI could perform tasks better and it can be better integrated into my work to free up my time.

AI: 

Thank you for sharing such candid insights about your experience with AI at work. Your perspective on the back-and-forth collaboration pattern, the challenges with coding assistance, and your hopes for better integration is really valuable.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest assessment of where AI excels - like email drafting - and where it still falls short, like the coding debugging issues you mentioned.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that stands out to you about how you work with these tools?

User: no

AI: [REDACTED]

Perfect, thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of your AI interactions, the specific challenges you face with coding assistance, and your overall positive outlook toward AI integration will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
