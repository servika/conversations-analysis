Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI summaries of long email threads or other notes to keep more efficient record.

AI: That's interesting - using AI to distill longer content into more manageable summaries. Tell me more about that. What does that process look like for you day-to-day?

User: I am on many teams that have differing forms of notes or meeting notes, so I try to condense them all into a similar format for me to keep centrally

AI: So you're essentially using AI to create a standardized format across different teams' documentation styles. That sounds like it helps you stay organized across multiple projects.

What made you decide to start using AI for this particular task rather than doing the condensing and formatting yourself?

User: To me, AI is more about formatting and synthesizing than creating. So, as a teacher, I don't use AI to plan my lessons, but I will put large amounts of info into AI to help me better organize and present that information.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're drawing - using AI for organizing and presenting rather than creating the core content. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I am sure I could better use AI to communicate with families and students, however, our current software already has a lot of integration, so the instances where I would need to email families isn't routine enough to warrant an automation design.

AI: That makes sense - the frequency and your existing systems play a role in where you draw the line. 

When you do use AI for work - like with those summaries and formatting tasks - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and let it handle the task independently?

User: Depending on the scope of the project, I sometimes summarize information months in advance if it is a larger macro view. More routinely, however, I use to plan ahead the week to 6 weeks that comprise a unit of study.

AI: So you're using AI at different time horizons - sometimes for those bigger picture, months-ahead summaries, and then more regularly for shorter-term unit planning. 

When you're working on either of those, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI - like asking it to adjust or refine things - or do you typically give it all the information you want summarized and then work with whatever it produces?

User: I am usually producing the record to have something more condensed/efficient to refer to later. Therefore, I don't necessarily return to the original product and adjust, but rather roll that product into further iterations of the process. If what I'm creating is more public-facing, like for the committees and departments I lead, I usually adjust that information manually as the nuances are sometimes too niche for AI to have realized.

AI: That's a really insightful workflow - using AI outputs as building blocks for future iterations rather than going back to perfect each individual piece. And I can see how those committee and department communications would need that human touch for the nuanced, context-specific elements.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find people are supportive, skeptical, or somewhere in between?

User: Unfortunately, as educators, we spend the majority of our time discussing how to limit student usage to ensure we're able to capture their understanding and skill set. We don't have any large initiatives to use AI as much as restrict it.

AI: That's a really interesting tension you're describing - being in an environment where the focus is primarily on restricting AI use rather than exploring its potential benefits for educators like yourself.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have really enjoyed using AI to help me make more complex spreadsheets for our data tracking and analysis. While I have decent knowledge and skills, it is nice to be able to create more intense and complex sheets that I wouldn't have desired devoting my own time and effort to previously.

AI: That sounds like AI is expanding what you feel capable of tackling - letting you create these more sophisticated data analysis tools without the time investment you'd need to figure it all out yourself.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not worried about maintaining my skills in providing quality instruction, however, we do frequently try to ascertain what forms of AI are reasonable parts of growing technology (like using a calculator or breakdown AI for formulas in math) versus things that replace the learning or critical thinking process (like relying on the AI generated answers for web searches.)

AI: That's such a thoughtful way to think about it - distinguishing between AI as a tool that supports learning versus AI that might bypass the learning process entirely. It sounds like you're constantly evaluating that line as an educator.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision that there will eventually become a new standard or normal for how research looks with the evolution and accessibility of AI. I envision my relationship as potentially strained due to my role as mediator between what is a helpful tool in learning versus that which is a substitute for learning.

AI: That tension you're describing - being caught between the potential benefits of AI as a learning tool and the need to ensure it doesn't replace actual learning - sounds like it could be a real challenge going forward.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that distinction between AI as a formatting and organizing tool versus a creative tool, and how you're navigating that educator role of determining what supports versus substitutes for learning.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that an outlet for AI that is underserved would be within teacher prep. For example, AI that could provide more questions for a certain text that targets a given skill would save time. Anything produced would have to be reviewed and potentially tweaked by the expert, however, there are times where it is hard to produce endless texts and questions for practice, and while there are resources available - searching for them is time consuming. A repository of things like this (TPT but AI) would be very realistically helpful.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea of AI helping generate practice materials and questions targeted to specific skills, essentially creating a more efficient way to access the kind of supplementary content teachers need without the time-consuming search process. It sounds like you're envisioning AI as a starting point that teachers would then refine with their expertise.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI as an educator - both in your own workflow and in thinking about student use - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've considered these different applications and tensions.
