Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it typically to look up coding concepts or syntax that I already know, but is not necessarily proficient (enough) in.  I sometimes also use it when I am stuck trying to solve a coding problem

AI: That's helpful to understand. When you say you use it for coding concepts or syntax you already know but aren't proficient enough in - can you give me a specific example of what that looks like in practice?

User: Well, for instance MSSQL that I have only recently begun using. There are some aspects, such as generating dynamic queries or dynamic view generation that carries a syntax and way of thinking that sort of transcends your average query design way of thinking

AI: That makes sense - so it sounds like you're dealing with more advanced database concepts that require a different mental model. When you get stuck on a coding problem, how do you typically approach using AI to help you work through it?

User: I start out by describing in as much detail as I can, using words. I then move on to providing code examples to illustrate what I am doing(of course with a proper degree of anonymization/generalization for security purposes)

AI: Interesting - so you lead with the verbal description first, then follow up with code. When you're working through these problems with AI, do you tend to work back and forth with it - like having a conversation to refine the solution - or do you more often describe the full problem upfront and expect a complete solution back?

User: A bit of both, it depends on the problem obviously. I`d probably say the latter a bit more often than the first. But obviously, there will almost always be a degree of back-and-forth conversation. Problems that are simple enough to be solved via one single question-answer pair , such as looking up one very specific syntax for something, I use google that would normally lead you directly to wikis defining commands/syntax/keywords, so those cases are too simplistic to be fed to the AI

AI: That's a really clear distinction - you're using AI for the more complex problems that need that conversational element, while sticking with traditional search for the straightforward syntax lookups. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain coding tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I do prefer to work as much as I can on more "problem solving"/analytically demanding tasks myself, at least for as long as possible. Being [REDACTED], this corresponds more or less to "the old ways", from which I am used to learning new concepts and sharpen my analytical skills. I do have a bit of a fear of being dulled down a bit in this department were I to use AI right away for these. However,  say I need a nested CASE-statement with various NULLIFs and CASTs with different formats (less analytically stimulating, lets be honest)- sure, I give that to the AI

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - preserving the analytical challenge for yourself while delegating the more routine, syntax-heavy work. When you mention the fear of being "dulled down" - can you tell me more about what that looks like or feels like when you're deciding whether to tackle something yourself first versus bringing in AI?

User: Well, obviously the type of problem you cannot easily find solutions to via more "encyclopedic" lookup type of research. Otherwise, see my last answer

AI: I understand - you're talking about those complex problems that don't have straightforward answers you can just look up. 

Let me shift gears a bit. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have there been any conversations or expectations around AI use at your job?

User: Yes, frequently, but more on a higher strategic level in the organisation. In my department, it is just getting started. But most of my closest colleagues do not in fact use this a lot, with some exceptions. I cannot really say that the team culture has influenced my own use - it is more of a solo thing.

AI: So it sounds like you're somewhat pioneering this in your immediate team, while the organization talks about it strategically. Since you mentioned it's more of a solo thing for you - can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, typically if you are almost there in terms of solving a problem, and you just cant figure out that last little bit, and then AI gives you that much needed "A-HA"  moment. That is when you feel that you have both accomplished quite a bit yourself *and* received much needed on-point help from AI that other tools could simply not provide.  The opposite situation would be when AI leads you astray, typically in areas where you are not proficient enough to "steer it" away from early pitfalls, and you end up either spending more time on something that turns out trivial-ish.

AI: That's such a vivid contrast - the "A-HA" moment when you've done most of the heavy lifting versus those situations where AI sends you down rabbit holes because you don't have enough expertise to course-correct early on.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider when deciding how to approach different tasks?

User: I still find it worthwhile to maintiain those skills,  as those areas will still be there if they are taken over or not, and they will, like now, almost always be part of a bigger context, where, at least in terms of my own workplace, I dont see AIs "taking over" in the foreseeable future.

AI: That makes sense - you're seeing AI as a tool within a larger context rather than something that will replace entire skill areas. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your current approach will change as the technology develops or as you get more comfortable with it?

User: I guess I will be using it more agentically when coding. Other than that, who knows what the future brings? Not me!

AI: Ha, fair enough - it's hard to predict! When you say "more agentically" - what does that look like to you? What would that change from how you're using it now?

User: For instance using windsurf or similar solutions to provide whole , runnable solutions, rather than generating code bits.

AI: Ah, so moving from getting code snippets to having AI generate complete, executable solutions. That's quite a shift from your current approach.

Those are all the main questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between preserving your analytical skills while strategically using AI for the more routine tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that balance between self-reliance and strategic AI use, especially around preserving analytical skills while delegating routine syntax work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
