Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions I think I understand

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: What I have been working on recently is attempting to attach the beta-lactamase enzyme to  various different nanopores created with both controlled breakdown and EBL. The aim for this is to be able to use the AC nanopore to detect beta-lactamase funcitonality. By learning the chemical signatures for beta-lactamse activity this way which we have been able to do by attaching the enzyme next to the nanopore. Our goal is to next implement it into a sensor clinicians can use for antibiotic resistance testing. So the initial

AI: That sounds like really fascinating work with important clinical applications. So you started with the idea of using nanopores to detect beta-lactamase activity, then moved through the process of creating the nanopores, attaching the enzymes, and learning those chemical signatures. 

Can you tell me a bit more about what those middle steps looked like - the actual experimental work and analysis phases before getting to where you are now with the sensor development?

User: Yes so sorry I will type in a separate window so I do not send before I am ready. We started with EBL because that is what our lab traditionally uses but then we found some articles (with AI) discussing using CBD for the nanopore creation because it allows you to make more high throughput sensors easier with lots of nanopores together. Plus, the set ups are not too expensive so we then set up one of those.
After we figured out how we would make our nanopores we had to decide how to attach our enzyme of interest without denaturing it somehow and messing up its ability to function and break apart antibiotic molecules. In previous research in my lab group we have used Gold nanoparticles for this type of attachment so that is what I got trained on for the attachment phase. There were a few different types of chemistry I tested in order to try to have the best enzyme attachment. I tried to use click chemistry, PEG-Maleimide + Cysteine-Tagged β-lactamase, and Thiol Gold. I had the best results in terms of active enzyme yield from PEG-M + Cys. Then I would expose the nanopores to solutions with beta-lactam and collected data on its activity with the AC nanopore. I trained an ML model on data from that and was able to improve my recognition levels of Beta-lactamase in the solution.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - thank you for walking through those steps. I'm particularly interested in a couple of things you mentioned. 

You said you found articles about using CBD for nanopore creation "with AI" - can you tell me more about that? What did using AI look like in that literature search process?

User: I explained what I wanted the nanopore for and did a deep research using chatgpt to help me collect sources and found solutions for potentially creating more high throughput, cheaper, and easier to make sensors

AI: Tell me more about that deep research process with ChatGPT. How did you approach that - what did you ask it, and how did you work together to find those solutions?

User: It was not super detailed I think I explained the goal of the project in rather crude terms and then asked for a collection of potential papers along with summaries of each of them so I could tell if I wanted to dive more into those methods and it found some good ones from a few years ago that were superhelpful and gave me the CBD method, and suggested the different attachment methods to work with

AI: That's really helpful to understand. So we're about a third of the way through our conversation now, and I'm curious - in that research process you just described, how did you decide to use ChatGPT for the literature search versus doing it through more traditional methods like PubMed or Google Scholar?

User: I generally prefer to use AI in general for these types of deep literary searches because it can synthesise information so quickly and serve as a great diving board into various sources. What makes it great is I can start like I said at sort of a surface level when it comes to these different ideas and then dive deep into the ones that I think sound the most apt instead of reading those papers myself and potentially losing details. Thus, I think having AI as a partner when it comes to this type of literary search is really quite helpful. At the same time I would not let it do the entire literary search for me without me double checking sources because sometimes I notice when reading through the sources it finds that it slightly misunderstood them

AI: That's a great point about it sometimes misunderstanding sources. When you do go back to double-check, what kinds of misunderstandings have you noticed, and how do you catch them?

User: Gosh that is a bit hard because it varies usually but generally from what I have noticed is context issues like taking a phrase out of context and making slight mistakes because of it. However, it is not super common just sometimes especially in articles with weird formatting or lots of tables and figures

AI: That makes sense - context and formatting issues can definitely trip up AI systems. Now thinking about the other parts of your research workflow - the experimental design, the actual lab work, the data analysis where you trained that ML model - where else in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I actually have not used AI tools much when it comes to data analysis I think if I did I would use it to verify my conclusions because so much of data analysis is telling a story about the data you found and I don't know if AI always knows which story to tell. For the ML model training I worked with some people from our group who are more of computer scientists than me they may have used AI but I am unsure I do not think so. If I was left to create and train the ML model completely on my own I think I would use AI much more heavily as I am not a strong in terms of computer science skills as I am in experimentation workflow creation. Thus, I think I have primarily used AI at the front end of experimentation but not as much in further parts of experiments because I am wary of how it may impact my results

AI: That's really insightful - you're making a distinction between using AI for exploratory work versus the parts that directly impact your results. You mentioned being wary about how AI might impact your results in the later stages. Can you tell me more about that wariness - what specifically concerns you about using AI in those parts of your research?

User: Well for example lets say I use AI to create a figure whenever I want to write up my results I don't want to look silly by having some sort of silly mistake in the figure where the data is misrepresented or for my figures to look wildly different from eachother for some reason. The times I have tried to use AI for data analysis it is just a bit to random in terms of how it creates figures for example to use. Additionally, I think using AI to check over my writing is a good idea but having it write the whole thing makes me feel like I am no longer the one steering the conclusions drawn from my research

AI: That really gets to something important - you want to maintain control over how your research story gets told and how your data gets represented. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - beyond those data analysis and writing concerns you mentioned - what else has kept you from trying AI in other areas?

User: Certain parts of the research process are unfortunately just not compatible with AI even though they are the part that would be most convenient to automate like running experiments. I also do not think using AI for a peer review makes sense as AI is not my peer. Experimentation and research is also an inherently up to me in some ways like what type of questions to ask and get answers to them. I think something that might be convenient is having an ethics bot that double checks experiment designs against general guidelines and highlights grey areas for the user to reason through on their own. However, I have not used something like thus far in my research.

AI: I like that ethics bot idea - that sounds like it could be really useful for flagging considerations you might want to think through. We're nearing the end of our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I think the thing I notice most that annoys me is when I ask for suggestions on my writings in the final stages of my work and AI models tend to always want to find something to improve. So, often when I ask if there is anything left to improve  it makes it sort of like a hedonic treadmill of fixing things and then fixing more things until I start just switching back and forth between things the AI says I need to fix that are really sort of preference. So it would be really nice to have AI models that give me one final overarching list of things to fix within my writing instead of an endless supply of potential things I could change. Maybe in practice having one or two checking steps and then having the AI affirm that everything looks good. 

I have noticed that there are definitely problems with using AI for final checks as well I wish it was able to better tie together scientific documents and make suggestions that keep them from being overly robotic.

AI: That's a really perceptive observation about the "hedonic treadmill" effect - AI always finding something to tweak even when your work might actually be ready. That endless cycle of revisions sounds frustrating.

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on using AI as a research partner in the early stages while being more cautious about maintaining control over your conclusions and results were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think that having a dedicated frame work of models with slightly different system instructions for each step within the research process would be so good for implementing AI better for research work. I don't necessarily always have time to adjust all the parameters of the model to my liking by prompting it and this could make things much faster and help provide nice punctuation between steps of the research process

AI: That's a brilliant idea - having specialized models tailored for different research phases could really address that friction you mentioned about having to constantly re-prompt and adjust the AI for each task. It sounds like it would help maintain those clear boundaries you want between exploration and analysis phases too.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research partner early on while maintaining control over your conclusions, and especially that observation about the endless revision cycle, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I really appreciate the time you took to walk me through your workflow and thinking process today!
