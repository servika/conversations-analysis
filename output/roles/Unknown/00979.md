Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great! I have no questions of my own before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For some context, my role is as an IT Project Coordinator. This involves coordinating, scheduling, and ensuring the completion of action items related to small to medium sized project for my company. I also am our de facto "IT guy" for our building, and the only one in this position, so I help with normal IT operations related tasks of many different kinds for our on-site employees.

I use AI mostly to obtain quick factual answers or as a starting point for research into technical topics. An example of the former would be "what is an .XYZ file type?" or "what port does X protocol typically communicate over" and an example of the latter would be "we're seeing XYZ errors in a the log file for this application, what is this indicative of and where should I start in troubleshooting?" if it's something I am not familiar with.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you're juggling quite a variety of technical responsibilities. 

When you use AI for those quick factual questions versus the more complex troubleshooting scenarios, how do you decide what level of detail or follow-up you need from the AI? Do you find yourself interacting differently with it depending on the type of problem you're facing?

User: For the questions with shorter factual answers, I don't typically require too much follow up from AI models. I almost always do a bit of my own independent research after getting an answer to fact-check and verify for accuracy, then am typically off and on my way. Follow-up questions or details usually aren't necessary in these cases.

AI: That makes sense - using AI as an efficient starting point and then verifying independently. 

What about those more complex troubleshooting scenarios you mentioned, like when you're seeing unfamiliar errors in log files? How do you typically work through those situations with AI compared to those quick factual lookups?

User: I usually provide inputs to the AI model such as verbatim error messages to get a sense of what the root cause of the issue might be or widely-known solutions. Sometimes, I ask follow up questions to the model if the original question reveals yet another component of the issue I am not familiar with. More often than not, once I have that baseline understanding I go off on my own, or collaborate with my teammates, to begin the troubleshooting process.

AI: Interesting - so AI helps you get that initial foundation of understanding, and then you move into more collaborative work with your teammates for the actual troubleshooting.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your IT coordinator role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: A good example of that would be tasks requiring larger inputs of data, such as that stored in an Excel spreadsheet or PowerBI data model. While the AI tools I use do have the ability for users to upload such files for the models to work with, I have found in practice that the results are usually mixed at best or poor and outright unusable at worst. I prefer to handle these kinds of tasks without AI assistance until it's proven they have advanced and are better equipped to help with them.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - recognizing where the current limitations are and working around them. It sounds like you've tested AI with those data-heavy tasks and found the reliability just isn't there yet.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it seems like you tend to get what you need from AI and then move on to work independently or with teammates. Is that generally how you approach it, or do you sometimes find yourself going back and forth with AI throughout a task?

User: Yes, the shorter conversations for a quick answer or a starting point are what the vast majority of my interactions with AI for work consist of. Sometimes, I have iterative conversations with AI when I don't get the answer I am initially looking for, and I'll add context or details to build on the initial answer that the model initially gave to try to better reach my goal.

 More often than not, that ends up being a lot of additional effort for relatively little return. I am still of the opinion AI isn't all that capable at handling complex tasks just yet. It will usually get stuck in a loop repeating the same kind of answer, or branching off and giving clearly incorrect answer, so I tend to stick to the short and sweet Q&A.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about those iterative conversations sometimes leading to diminishing returns. It sounds like you've developed a pretty clear sense of AI's current sweet spot for your work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others around you are using it similarly, or are there different approaches you've noticed?

User: Since I am the only IT guy in my role in the building I don't have any others to compare my approach with. In general, my organization does encourage the use of AI models especially the private service they pay for that is safe to upload sensitive data to.

AI: That's interesting that your organization actively encourages AI use and has invested in a private service for handling sensitive data - that sounds like quite a supportive environment for experimentation.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I find myself satisfied with AI when I find an obscure piece of information in seconds that Googling surely would have taken for longer, if it even turned it up at all! I find myself frustrated with AI when I can reiterate and state my question extremely clearly and the AI either gets stuck in a loop giving a wrong answer which I have already explicitly called out, or it gives answers which I know for sure are false, but they are presented as absolute fact. Both of these scnearios still happen quite often.

AI: Those frustrations sound really relatable - especially that loop behavior where you've already told it the answer is wrong but it keeps circling back to the same response. And I can see how the confident delivery of incorrect information would be particularly problematic in IT work where accuracy is crucial.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really factor into how you approach your work?

User: I haven't given this all that much consideration. I have worked for many different clients and found that many companies are already so behind in technology adoptions standards that even if an AI assistant came out that was capable of replacing my job role, the wide-spread adoption would take longer than the couple decades I have left in my career.

AI: That's a really practical and grounded perspective - the reality of how slowly technology adoption happens in many organizations versus the pace of AI development.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the tools improve, or do you think you'll stick with the approach you've developed?

User: I will definitely continue to use it as I have been for short, quick, and high-value answers. Hopefully going forward the models can advance to the point I can trust them to work out tougher coding-related tasks or in deeper data analysis. I think this would be an incredible benefit.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've found AI's current sweet spot for quick factual lookups while recognizing its limitations with more complex, iterative tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No this was it from me too.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's strengths for quick information gathering while recognizing where human expertise is still essential will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
