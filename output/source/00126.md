Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, let us begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI  for a variety of different tasks. These tasks can range from summarizing long emails and reports to analyzing data. Due to the risks of AI being inaccurate at times, the work still requires double checking and sensitive tasks are all done manually. Further examples of tasks could be generating ideas on how to optimize revenue, taking a data set and extracting information, or even simply editing responses to ensure they sound professional.

AI: That's a helpful overview. I'd like to dig deeper into one of those examples you mentioned. When you say you use AI for generating ideas on how to optimize revenue, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like for you?

User: Taking into consideration the conditions of the different markets,  I may want to try and explore different pricing methods when a particular market is not doing so well or sometimes, to better optimize a market already doing well. I may feed an AI model with a great deal of historical data such as past ticket prices and demand in order to have the model analyze and propose different ways pricing can be adjusted to optimize sales.

AI: That sounds like you're working with complex market dynamics. Tell me more about how you actually work with the AI once you've fed it that historical data - do you find yourself going back and forth with questions and refinements, or do you typically give it all the information upfront and let it generate a complete analysis?

User: That would depend on the task at hand. Sometimes, a general overview and summary of a market's performance during a specific period is sufficient to make decisions. In other scenarios, more refinements may be required to ensure that all of the information I am looking for is included. For example, I may feed the model a great deal of data on the price patterns and sales strategies in place in the last three months for a specific market. I may ask the model to indicate at which points it appears that the strategies are failing and sales have failed to hit the required revenue threshold. I may inquire things such as what price point resulted in negative yield or optimal yield.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned earlier that sensitive tasks are done manually due to accuracy concerns. Are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Personally, I believe AI to be capable of almost anything. That being said, as previously mentioned, AI do provide inaccurate answers from time to time and can make incorrect calculations or be heavily influenced by false information online. Anything of significance to stakeholders such as total revenue figures must be double and triple checked if using AI for assistance or done manually. Other than circumstances which may have great risks, I prefer to handle tasks that require personalization.  I avoid using AI for tasks such as answering inquiries that require specific in-depth, professional knowledge or experience. As most models are well-rounded without specific focuses on niched subjects, advice given by these models are often surface level. They often are incapable of providing deep advice on specific and complicated topics.

AI: That makes sense - you're drawing clear lines based on risk and expertise requirements. When you do use AI for those appropriate tasks, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach using these tools? Are there any unwritten rules or expectations around AI use in your work environment?

User: The company is aware of the potential of AI and its uses in the industry. There is even a specific department dedicated to AI sciences, who help to develop software and begin integrating AI into different areas of interest. For the revenue management department, there is little to no rules or expectations regarding AI use. Essentially, the only expectation is that if we choose to use AI, we had better be accurate. Many of my colleagues are not as savvy with technology and don't rely on AI assistance.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I sometimes find myself getting frustrated with AI's limitations especially regarding generating papers, reports, or even paragraphs. It is evident that AI struggles with limitations such as word counts. There are a good number of times where instructions such as a specific word limit would not be followed. Then, while attempting to correct this, I'll often find myself getting trapped in a loop of try agains and undos.

AI: That loop of corrections sounds really tedious. Tell me more about what happens during those frustrating cycles - are you finding yourself spending more time trying to get the AI to follow the instructions than it would have taken to just write it yourself?

User: Potentially. I do sometimes spend quite a great deal of time trying to get the AI to achieve what I desire. However, it would be incredibly rare for me to spend as much time trying to get the AI to perform the task right compared to how much time I would need to spend getting it done myself. Often I would take what is generated and edit it myself to achieve what I need.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that no matter how developed AI becomes, there will always need to be a person that can still perform the same tasks. Technology is still greatly limited by potential risks. If there were a power outage or the internet went down, someone still needs to be able to perform the necessary tasks. This is indeed a topic that I've actively considered.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Considering all of the advancements and integrations that are already coming out of the AI sciences department, I foresee an even closer relationship working with AI. As accuracy increases and the models become better at interpreting user intents, there will be less need to check their work. Even more time can be saved and much less effort would be required for analytics.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while being mindful of accuracy risks, especially with stakeholder-facing work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the practical challenges of AI integration - from those frustrating formatting loops to the careful risk assessment you do around sensitive data - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
