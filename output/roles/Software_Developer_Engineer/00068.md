Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today - I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions - I'm ready to start.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I work in astrophysics. A recent project of mine involved a study of the central supermassive black hole in a nearby active galactic nucleus. The process began by writing an observing proposal to use a particular space-based observatory (in this case, XMM-Newton) in order to meet my scientific objectives. This was successful and, later, the observation was performed and I received the data. I analysed this large dataset along with my collaboration group, spreading out the work according to the expertise of the respective team members. We used some of the latest models and theories from the scientific literature in order to test various scenarios for the outflowing wind from this black hole. Eventually, we obtained scientifically interesting results from the data, which I wrote up for publication in an astrophysical journal.

AI: That's fascinating - thank you for walking me through that process. It sounds like quite a comprehensive journey from proposal to publication.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Four ways that I implemented AI immediately come to mind:

- Given the huge size of the dataset (millions of individual 'events'), I used AI to help manipulate the dataset in a more efficient manner. For example, I used it to create time series in various different formats (binning, wavelength band, etc) in order to analyse the variability.

- I used AI to help summarise the key findings of long research papers in the literature. This helped me to speed up the process of performing a literature review and placing my results into context.

- I used AI to help with data visualisation. I used it to help create plots and graphs in various different forms, predominantly to provide me with inspiration for the final plots and figures I would use in the publication.

- I also used AI to help with the writing process of the paper. I used it to help me word complicated sections and to describe complex astrophysical models. This was more of a 'guiding hand' to give me useful ideas for phrasing, clarity, and structure.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you've integrated AI across multiple stages of your research process. Let me dig deeper into one of those areas.

For the data manipulation work you mentioned - dealing with those millions of individual events - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: For the data manipulation, the crucial point is that I wanted to perform a new type of analysis on these data. This required the data to be formatted in various different ways for which I did not have any existing code written. So I would have needed to write a new piece of complex code from scratch. This is why I turned to AI as it helped to speed up the process and work more efficiently.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - so it was really about efficiency for a new type of analysis you hadn't done before.

Thinking about the other parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: For some areas of my research, I already have existing code written that I am highly confident in using. Secondly, I use a wide variety of astrophysical models when fitting my data - but many of these are written and published by other members of the scientific community and there is no need to modify them. In essence, for some core parts of my work, I already have access to an appropriate software suite and catalogue of models and there is no requirement to use AI in this aspect of my research.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - you're already well-equipped in those areas. 

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Let me ask about the areas where you have used AI: When you've used AI for something like literature summarization or writing assistance, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: For writing assistance, I already know the essence of what I want to say. So I can verify this quite quickly by reading the output and checking whether I agree with what it has written. The point here is that I use it for inspiration and ideas, but I read all output carefully and only use something if I agree with it.

The same applies for summarising text. I still read the original text myself and so I already know the essence of what should be produced. For anything that involves numbers or mathematical formulae, I always check these carefully by hand as I think this is an area where mistakes are more likely to slip through.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using it as inspiration while maintaining your own expertise as the ultimate filter. The distinction you make about being especially careful with numbers and mathematical formulae is particularly interesting.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I really wish AI was better equipped to help with interpreting and analysing results and/or the output of my analysis. It often seems to fail in its scientific reasoning leading to interpretations and discussion points that range from missing key points to being downright wrong. I wish I could provide AI with the output of some analysis and, given the context, have it interpret it in an accurate and reliable manner.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - the gap between AI being helpful with mechanics and structure versus the deeper scientific reasoning and interpretation that's at the heart of your work.

We're nearing the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions, and your perspectives on how you balance AI efficiency with scientific rigor have been particularly valuable. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Two issues that I have concerns about are hidden biases and reproducibility (unseen algorithms/pipelines, etc). These are two hurdles that currently prevent me from feeling reassured enough to use AI more than I currently do.

AI: Those are really important concerns that cut to the heart of scientific integrity. Thank you for raising those - the issues of hidden biases and reproducibility are fundamental to maintaining trust in scientific work.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about using AI as an efficiency tool while maintaining rigorous verification processes, and particularly your point about the current limitations in scientific reasoning and interpretation, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real astrophysical research. The concerns you raised about biases and reproducibility also highlight some critical areas that need attention as AI tools continue to evolve in scientific contexts.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective as someone actively using AI in cutting-edge astrophysics research has been incredibly valuable.

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for your time and thoughtful responses. Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your ongoing research on active galactic nuclei!
