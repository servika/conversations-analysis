Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to create a rough draft of things like forms and emails

AI: That's interesting - using AI for those initial drafts. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're working on forms and emails, what does that interaction with AI typically look like from start to finish?

User: For an email response, I will provide the full text of the email I need to respond to, or just the relevant information in the email, then indicate what things I would like my email response to include. When the AI gives me a draft, I read it over and ask it to adjust the tone, length, or details as necessary. When it is at a good enough point, I will copy the AI response, edit it to make it sound more like my writing style, and then send it off.

AI: That sounds like a pretty collaborative process - you're working back and forth with the AI to refine it, then adding your own touch at the end.

When you're doing that final editing to make it sound more like your writing style, what specific things are you typically changing or adjusting?

User: Usually I will change complex words to simpler ones to mimic my own speech. I might also edit symbols and take out em dashes.

AI: That makes sense - tailoring the language and punctuation to match how you naturally communicate.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to organize information on my own, even though I could input information into an AI and request how I want it to be organized. I enjoy the process of organizing things myself.

AI: That's really interesting that you find the organizing process itself enjoyable and prefer to keep that for yourself.

Can you tell me more about what you like about organizing information? What is it about that process that makes you want to hold onto it rather than delegate it?

User: I simply enjoy the simple repetitive nature of it.

AI: I can understand that - there's something satisfying about that kind of methodical, hands-on work.

When you use AI for work, you mentioned that back-and-forth process with emails. Thinking more broadly, are you typically collaborating with AI throughout tasks like that, or are there times when you delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: No, it is always collaborative when I use AI. I never entirely delegate tasks to it.

AI: That collaborative approach seems consistent across how you work with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your workplace has particular attitudes or policies around AI use?

User: I find that my colleagues tend to use AI also in their emails.

AI: So it sounds like AI use for emails is fairly common among your colleagues.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't think AI has ever frustrated me, because I know it is an imperfect system and do not have the expectation of perfection from it. I do feel satisfied when it produces high quality email responses for me though because that saves me a couple minutes here and there.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - having realistic expectations seems to help avoid frustration, and you get that satisfaction from the time savings.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it is important to maintain those skills, otherwise AI will take over. I think that people are becoming very reliant on AI which is why that path is being paved (the path for AI to take over). If people were maintaining those types of skills, they would not be as reliant on AI.

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about dependency and skill preservation. It sounds like you see maintaining those abilities as important for keeping some balance of control.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue with this collaborative approach, or do you see it changing in some way?

User: I don't know that I will ever entirely delegate tasks to AI, but it is possible that that will change in the future. I plan to continue to collaborate with it, and as it improves, I will be able to collaborate in more ways than just for email communications.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining skills to avoid over-reliance, and how you've developed that collaborative approach that works for you.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's everything.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that collaborative workflow, your approach to maintaining skills, and how you balance efficiency with preserving the parts of work you enjoy will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
