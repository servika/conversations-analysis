Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I have no questions right now.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI a lot to help me look at code documentation, learn from examples of code use, and for brainstorming. I will ask for summaries of files or code bases, and ask follow up questions to confirm my understanding or to confirm the AI is not hallucinating. I delegate tasks that are time consuming but without much room for mistakes, like "apply this change to this other section of code."

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned delegating tasks that are time-consuming but don't have much room for mistakes - that's an interesting way to think about it.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Tasks regarding sensitive information are a bit uncomfortable for me to delegate to AI, even when it confirms it won't retain that information in memory. I also try to handle a lot of base logic planning in my code, because I am still a junior developer and don't want to be fully reliant on AI. Often times I will ask the AI for a suggestion, but then rewrite it myself the way I like it anyways.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - wanting to maintain your own skill development as a junior developer while still leveraging AI's capabilities.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I like to collaborate with it, and don't like delegating too many tasks for it to handle independently. Recently I did allow it to handle some integration with an MCP server and cursor's AI assistant, because I am unfamiliar with doing so, and I wanted to make it to my assigned task of exploring what an MCP server does instead of wasting time getting it running. Most of the time, I mostly ask it for suggestions, ask it to do specific things for me, or alter its suggestions to suit my own preferences.

AI: That's a great example with the MCP server - using AI to handle the setup so you could focus on the exploration part that was actually your assigned task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I think I've actually used AI much more than I was expecting to because my workplace is very AI-friendly. I am encouraged to use AI to speed up things when appropriate, but with obvious caution and understanding that AI is far from flawless and its work should be double checked.

AI: It sounds like having that supportive environment has really opened up your AI usage beyond what you initially anticipated.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I once asked a question about some documentation, primarily to confirm my understanding of something, but the AI replied with a hallucination. Twice in a row, when I tried to point out the hallucination, the AI doubled down on it. Once it finally admitted the hallucination, it repeatedly apologized for several more responses. I'm also often worried that AI is being too people-pleasing and always agreeing with my suggestions instead of correcting me when necessary.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to verify your understanding and the AI doubles down on incorrect information. The over-apologizing afterward must have been annoying too.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Considering I do a lot of programming work and AI is becoming very big in that space and taking over a lot of programming tasks, I'm even more concerned with maintaining and expanding my programming skills. I have an understanding that AI isn't flawless, and also needs skilled programmers to guide and train it. I see it as a tool to augment things, no replace me.

AI: That perspective of AI as augmentation rather than replacement seems to align well with how you're approaching your development as a junior programmer.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will continue with my current relationship with AI for quite some time. A coworker of mine has a lot more experience both with AI (and researching AI) and programming, and is more comfortable delegating large tasks to an AI to handle independently. I would like to get comfortable enough with my skills to do that. I'm currently uncomfortable with that because I need to spend more time reviewing what the AI has done to confirm it's actually done what I want and made no mistakes.

AI: That makes perfect sense - wanting to build up your own expertise so you can more confidently evaluate when AI has done what you intended.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while being intentional about developing your own skills as a junior developer.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: My organization is trying to build new AI-powered tools for a blockchain, so I will be continuing to learn and utilize AI quite a lot for the foreseeable future. I've most recently been doing a lot of learning about different AI topics, like agents, MCPs, etc. That's probably the only remaining thing to mention.

AI: That's really interesting context - being in an organization that's actively building AI-powered tools definitely puts you at the forefront of these developments. The fact that you're exploring agents and MCPs shows you're diving deep into the technical side of AI integration.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with skill development, the importance of verification, and how workplace culture influences adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
