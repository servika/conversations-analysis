Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My most recent research project was a literature review and combined data analysis of research surrounding radioactive contamination in [REDACTED] aquifers. The idea started from a previous project of mine where I created a model predicting future contamination based on the addition of anthropogenic contaminants such as road salt. I wanted to study a specific area, find the trend of contamination over a decadal scale, and use the model to help determine future contamination. I also wanted to compare the model's results predictions to historical results to help further identify the accuracy of the model.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive project combining multiple approaches. Tell me more about what the actual process looked like once you had that initial idea - how did you move from concept to gathering data and analysis?

User: The first step was to identify which aquifer to focus on. There are many possible areas in the country that have the necessary geology to cause radioactive contamination if certain reactions take place in the aquifer. Then, I needed to determine where to source the data. There are a lot of data sets out there but the data I need require some more niche information. After that I needed to process some of the data, namely some of the more basic statistical analyses. Finally, I needed to find literature that was relevant to the topic.  The literature was used to compare and contrast my findings to that of prior research.

AI: Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Beyond the conceptualization of the research topic, I've experimented with AI tools throughout the different steps. Primarily, I have utilized AI to help me process data and identify other pieces of pertinent literature.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for processing data and identifying literature.

User: I decided to utilize AI to supplement the traditional approaches. The same steps and techniques were used but AI was used as a tool - helping me quickly process data so that I could identify trends then go in myself and process the data where I identified trends. It also helped me quickly identify materials, providing me with lists of surmised literature that I could then go and read, after I read through the surmised literature and determined what was pertinent to my work.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using it as a supplement rather than a replacement. Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Several things are keeping me from using it throughout my work. The main factor is that I would like my research to be my own - my own ideas, analyses, and conclusions. Along that line of thinking, it's integral to the scientific process to follow certain steps and ensure that my research is all of my own work - often, utilizing AI for these portions of research creates ethical issues. Another reason that I do not utilize AI for certain things is because the AI itself does a poor job scouring literature, most of the time. It can identify stuff, but the synopses that it provides are often missing key details and misquoting information. It's not reliable or consistent.

AI: When you've used AI for data processing and literature identification, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I never take what AI produces and use it without verifying or validating. I consider AI to be the first step of many, I always go in and run any calculations and read any materials thoroughly myself. I never use anything that AI writes, everything it produces is considered but the work and research produced must be my own.

AI: We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would have AI help me with paring down and reading sources. It's something I have it do presently, but it does a very poor job of it. Identifying and reading literature is one of the more taxing parts of research. If AI could consistently identify papers that would be relevant to my research and take the most important parts, creating an accurate synopsis as it pertains to what I am looking for, that would be a game changer.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a supplement to maintain research integrity while still gaining efficiency benefits were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining ownership of your research while strategically using AI as a verification tool really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The tension you described between wanting efficiency gains and preserving research integrity is something I imagine many scientists grapple with.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
