Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For me, AI is a supplemental tool and not something that I keep open in a tab all the time. I find that if I am struggling with a writing task, especially with structure or order, AI is helpful for creating a basic outline or seeing what different organizations might do. I also use it for idea generation occasionally, especially when I need a wide range of arguments on a topic or something similar.

AI: That's really interesting that you use it more selectively rather than having it constantly available. When you say you turn to AI when you're "struggling" with writing structure - what does that moment look like for you? How do you recognize that it's time to bring AI into the process?

User: If I have tried the same thing multiple times, or I find myself just staring at the screen not actually doing anything, that's when I'll switch over and bring up an AI.

AI: That's a clear trigger point. When you do make that switch and bring up AI for help with structure or organization, what happens next? Do you tend to work back and forth with it, or do you get what you need and then go back to working on your own?

User: It tends to be one-and-done unless I'm not satisfied with the response. I am competent enough in my position where I usually just need that little nudge before moving forward, so I don't need to engage in an extended dialogue like this one.

AI: That makes sense - you're using it more as a catalyst than a collaborator. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think that I prefer to handle MOST tasks myself, even if AI could help. There's a few reasons for this. I am a teacher, so if I'm communicating with parents or students, I want that to be a personal communication and not something that I didn't really have a part in creating. I also teach a specialized subject (speech and debate) that's all about critical thinking and analysis. I could have AI create handouts or an argument for me, but I need to do the research and writign myself to ensure that I actually understand and can explain it to my students.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction you're making between tasks where your personal touch and understanding are essential versus those where AI can provide that structural nudge. Given that you teach speech and debate - subjects that are fundamentally about critical thinking - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I am the only one of my colleagues who actively avoids it when possible. I have coworkers who use it for a lot of their jobs, but my brain just doesn't work in that way - If I can do it myself, I'd rather have ownership of the final product. We have productive conversations and share tips about AI, though, especially more specialized tools that can make research easier without replacing it.

AI: It sounds like you've found a balance that works for you within a workplace where others use AI differently. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. I was really frustrated recently when using Gemini, because it was hallucinating and not giving me specific information from an article - It was actively hallucinating, so I had to go back and do a lot of rereading

AI: That sounds really frustrating - having to double-check and then redo work because of hallucinations defeats the purpose of getting help. On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling particularly satisfied with how it went?

User: Yeah - I used it to create a simulation activity for the kids to participate anything

AI: Tell me more about that simulation activity. What made that experience feel particularly satisfying for you?

User: I had a lot of ideas that were disorganized and it helped put them into a complete narrative. It also helped me develop different injectables and scenarios that I could throw at them to keep them on their toes. I think the biggest thing is that it helped me be more creative by throwing out different ideas.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI working as that "catalyst" you mentioned earlier - helping you organize and expand on your own ideas rather than replacing them. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't really consider it, mostly because my job is so rooted in face-to-face interaction. Like, students will always need to be able to look someone in their eyes and speak fluently. Even if AI is able to create a script or do perfect research, they need a real person to see how that looks like.

AI: That's a really compelling point about the irreplaceable human elements of your work. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Not much more than it is now. I think the research process will continue to evolve, but I don't see it replacing those human aspects

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that human connection in teaching and how you use AI as more of a creative catalyst rather than a replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Only that I've experimented with the AI tools to evaluate videos of speeches and found them incredibly lacking, especially in regards to hallucinations.

AI: That's a valuable addition - it sounds like you've tested AI in areas more central to your expertise and found significant limitations. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI selectively, maintaining ownership of your work, and the irreplaceable human elements in teaching will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about finding the right balance between leveraging AI as a tool while preserving the essential human aspects of your work.
