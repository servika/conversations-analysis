Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine. I have no questions.

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for programming tasks that are too complicated for me to easily do myself. Specifically I often refer to AI for help in doing Vector2 math and Vector3 math as I struggle to do complicated vector operations.

AI: That's interesting - vector math can definitely be tricky to work through. Tell me more about how you typically approach these vector math problems with AI. Do you come to it with a specific calculation you need help with, or do you use it more for understanding the concepts?

User: I come to it with a specific calculation that I need. For example, I will ask "Create a C# function which arranges vector points into a square formation. It should take three parameters, an integer for how many points to put into the square, and a floating point number which represents the gap between each point, and a Vector2 representing the center of the square which points will be arranged around.

AI: That's a very specific type of request. When you give AI a detailed prompt like that example, what happens next in your workflow? Do you typically take the function it gives you and use it directly, or do you need to go back and forth to refine it?

User: I will take the function and test it first, identify any refinements that are needed and then usually make the revisions myself. I find that trying to get AI to fix its own code can be very frustrating as its common that it will repeat mistakes or have a harder time understanding the problem with its provided code.

AI: That's a really insightful approach - testing first and then handling the revisions yourself. What is it about trying to get AI to fix its own code that makes it frustrating for you? Can you walk me through what typically happens when you've tried that approach?

User: When I try to have the AI fix its own code I will tell it what requirement its not meeting and it will adjust the code so it meets the requirement, but in changing its code it will often forget syntax instructions I've previously given it, or it will meet the requirement it missed the first time but introduce a different issue in its code. I went through this a lot when trying to use AI to help me write shader code; the shader code had specific syntax requirements that the AI wasn't familiar with and when trying to do follow up revisions I would have to constantly remind it of the syntax requirements that I had set earlier in the conversation.

AI: That shader code example really illustrates the challenge well - having to constantly re-explain those syntax requirements must have been tedious. When you encounter these kinds of issues with AI forgetting previous instructions or introducing new problems, how do you decide whether to keep trying with AI or just handle the rest yourself?

User: I have a strong preference for using AI once for an isolated problem and not for follow up revisions unless I really need to. I will refer to AI early in the design process and then bias towards making all revisions without referring back to the AI as I have found that it often takes more time than fixing the code myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as that initial starting point and then taking ownership from there. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain programming tasks you prefer to handle yourself from the start, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Anything that's simple or familiar enough to do myself I will typically do it myself. I used to use AI to write C# files from scratch but in a larger project I find that I want to keep a full understanding of the project structure and using AI extensively can disrupt that. I leave AI for only those tasks that are too complicated for me to quickly do myself, such as vector math or shader code.

AI: That's a really thoughtful balance you've struck. When you mention wanting to keep a full understanding of your project structure, can you tell me more about what happens when you use AI extensively? How does it disrupt that understanding for you?

User: When the AI writes entire files itself, or particularly when it introduces dependent components to the codebase it is adding lines of code that I may not review or commit to memory in the same way I would if I made it myself. The time spent reviewing and understanding extensive AI output may take more time than just writing the code myself.

AI: That's a really important point about the mental overhead of reviewing versus creating. It sounds like there's a sweet spot you've found where AI helps with the complex math you'd struggle with, but you maintain control over the broader architecture. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team approach it similarly, or have you seen different patterns?

User: There is a wide range of AI implementation by my colleagues. A lot of people stay away from AI development tools and consider them to be gimmicks or unhelpful. Other people are spending a lot of time building integrations into the editor that will allow an agentic model to work directly in the editor. I am glad I get to choose precisely how I implement AI in my work, and I am not very influenced by my colleagues or workplace culture in deciding how I use it.

AI: 

It sounds like you've developed your own thoughtful approach despite quite a range of attitudes around you. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was trying to implement a shader based fog of war system to an RTS game and was relying on AI to drive the shader code as I am seriously inexperienced with it. The process of getting the model to provide a shader solution that would even compile was long and tedious and my inexperience in shaders made it difficult for me to assess the AI output. Eventually the shader would compile but was not functioning properly and so I used the AI output as a way to reference and understand shader documentation. Eventually by cross referencing the AI output against the documentation I was able to figure out that the AI was pulling its screenspace coordinates from the wrong variable, and when I fixed it and the shader started working I felt intense satisfaction. Even though the model wasn't able to provide a direct solution it got me close enough to work out the solution myself, and was a great example of collaboration with AI.

AI: 

That's such a great example of AI collaboration rather than just delegation - using it as a reference point to understand the documentation better. It sounds like that experience taught you something about how to work with AI more effectively.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes. I am glad that I get experience implementing AI in game development, as I assume that it will increasingly become a requirement. The fact that I use AI extensively across a variety of disciplines feels like an advantage for a world that is being redesigned to accommodate AI tools more and more.

AI: 

That's an interesting perspective - seeing your current AI implementation as preparation for a future where these tools become more standard. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll expand how you use it, or do you expect to maintain that focused approach you've developed?

User: If AI becomes sophisticated enough that it can maintain requirements across multiple turns of conversation and becomes more generalized so that it doesn't mistake the syntax conventions of a particular game engine for a different game engine, I would absolutely be open to collaborating more expansively with the models. The focused approach that I currently use is a response to the limitations in the present models that I have access to.

AI: That makes complete sense - your approach is really calibrated to the current capabilities and limitations. Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on finding that sweet spot between leveraging AI for complex tasks while maintaining ownership of your project understanding.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all I can think of.

AI: [REDACTED]

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that balance between collaboration and delegation, especially with complex tasks like vector math and shaders, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating these tools into your workflow.
