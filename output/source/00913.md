Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a newspaper reporter. While AI is not good enough (at least not yet) to write news articles as well as professional journalists, it still is something I use to help speed up my work. I mainly use AI in two ways. 1.) As a brain storming tool to help with the creative writing aspects of my work. 2.) To sift through large blocks of text for information that is relevant to news coverage.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as both a creative partner and an information processor. 

Tell me more about how you use it for brainstorming. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: Usually, I explain to the AI what kind of story I am working on and some background and contextual information, and I ask it for several different ways to present the information. While the AI is usually not exactly correct, its ideas often cause a lightbulb to go off in my head. I also sometimes mention famous news publications to help shape the AI's tone when writing.

AI: That's fascinating - so the AI serves as a creative catalyst rather than giving you the final answer. 

When you mention that the AI is "usually not exactly correct," can you walk me through what happens next? How do you take that initial spark and develop it into something that works for your story?

User: Because I usually already know what the story is, once I have that initial spark, I just start writing. Often, the first paragraph is the hardest to come up with, so that is generally what I am using the AI to help me brainstorm. Sometimes, I have combined different parts of three or four ideas from AI and then mixed them with my own ideas and adapt them to my news story.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - breaking through that initial writing block. 

You mentioned you also use AI to sift through large blocks of text for relevant information. Can you describe what that process looks like? What kinds of documents are you typically working with?

User: The documents can range from SEC filings for large corporations (e.g., annual results, quarterly results, etc.) to court filings (e.g., a complaint, charging documents, court orders, etc.). Generally, I will copy and paste the text into the AI and then ask the AI to summarize in one paragraph and to give me some key bullet points. After I have that, I then can skim through the document on my own to make sure that the AI didn't commit any errors. Since the AI is already giving me key information, it makes it easier for me to sift through a large document to exactly what the AI is talking about. I have found AI to be particularly accurate at these types of tasks.

AI: That's a smart verification process - using the AI's summary as a roadmap to guide your own review. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are no tasks that I can think of that I prefer to handle myself, even though AI could help. If AI can help, I will use it, as speed is particularly important in the newspaper business.

AI: That's a pragmatic approach - prioritizing speed and efficiency. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I generally collaborate with AI. I give it instructions and then I often refine those instructions later based on the response. Even with the large blocks of text, I generally I have a broad idea of what I might be looking for. I generally start with more open ended prompts and then make them more specific as needed.

AI: That iterative refinement process sounds really effective. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your newsroom has particular attitudes or policies around AI use?

User: No, they have not. My newsroom has never discussed AI use.

AI: Interesting - so you've essentially been navigating AI use on your own. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I generally feel particularly satisfied when AI allows me to break a creative block when writing stories. Sometimes, when under intense deadline pressure, getting over the initial hump of the first couple paragraphs is a big deal. I can remember being stuck on how to craft the first sentences of the story, but then AI was able to essentially give me vague ideas that ended up working.

AI: That sounds like a real lifesaver in high-pressure moments. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have been prioritizing the types of stories that AI is not good enough to generate — stories that have more human angles rather than data angles. However, I have yet to see anything that an AI has written that would be good enough for a newspaper. While that may change and some newsrooms may start using AI in different capacities, I don't think they will replace humans, as news organizations will not want to put their entire reputation in the hands of an AI.

AI: That's a thoughtful strategic approach - focusing on the human elements that AI can't replicate well.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect AI to continue playing an increasing role in my work. I expect that it will continue to get better and better, which will likely lead to me incorporating it in different ways in the future (though I'm not sure at this point what those other ways might be).

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a creative catalyst to break through writing blocks and your strategic approach to focusing on human-centered stories.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, there isn't anything else.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a brainstorming partner and document analysis tool, while maintaining that critical human oversight, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about your workflow and the practical ways you've integrated AI into journalism. Have a great rest of your day!
