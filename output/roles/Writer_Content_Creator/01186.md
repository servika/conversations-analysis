Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive in. 

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer and editor, so my flow varies a lot from project to project, but generally it goes like this:
-I go over the initial version of the project, be it notes I took on a show or movie or a rough draft someone else sends me, like a blog post or a manuscript. I take it in and make any obvious edits, like fixing typos or grammar mistakes, or rephrasing things that don't quite sound right.
-I typically like to wait a while before proceeding with the next step, which is thinking over the whole project and how the major ideas fit together. This often involves me rearranging whole paragraphs, cutting and moving chunks of text, more intricate rephrasing, and sometimes adding headers to break up lengthy web posts. If I'm drafting an original post, it usually looks like me organizing thoughts into distinct categories and then weaving them together so they sound like they flow together naturally. If there are a lot of notes and the thoughts are hard to keep track of, I may color-code them to make it easier. If I'm doing something like editing a manuscript, this is where I might make more overarching story or character notes in the margins as I read.
-The final step is to read the whole thing through again and polish it up, making sure that all my edits flow naturally and make sense, and, if it's not my work, that it still sounds like the original author. If I'm editing a manuscript, this is where I'll type out a letter highlighting what I think are the most crucial areas that need looking at. 
-If I'm editing or writing something for the web, the last step is to go through and do basic SEO edits.

AI: That's a really thorough breakdown of your process - I can see how much thought goes into each stage. The way you describe waiting between that initial review and the deeper structural work is particularly interesting.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Rarely, if ever, do I use AI in the creative process itself - I enjoy writing and I generating the basics takes the fun out of it for me. What I do use it for is to keep track of character and setting notes in original fiction and when reading complex manuscripts: My notes are often messy and disorganized, and when I was younger I often found myself wishing I could have some sort of Clippy-esque assistant that would just be able to read through my notes and answer any question I had directly. This is especially useful in works with a lot of characters or places to keep track of - doubly so for fictional ones with no other reference material for those things.

AI: That's fascinating - you've essentially found your "Clippy-esque assistant" for organization! I love how specific that use case is. It sounds like you're using AI as a kind of smart filing system for complex information rather than for the creative generation itself.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was writing a scene in a fantasy setting that contained dozens of potential character interactions - I'm co-writing a novel with another author in a sort of literary roleplay-type format, so there are a number of potential interactions that could happen at any given time. I was able to use an AI assistant to go through the names and place them in different areas of a large palace ballroom and social scene, and then to move them around naturally as the scene continued. There is no way I could have pulled off the true randomness of the interactions and character groupings without such a tool, and the resulting scenes would not have been nearly as interesting as what we produced.

AI: That's really compelling - using AI to manage the logistics of complex social dynamics so you could focus on the actual storytelling. It sounds like it enabled a level of scene complexity that would have been overwhelming to track manually.

When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I would say that it's maybe a 60-30-10 split - I wrote most of the background material, but my creative partner is in full control of the lead character, and therefore of wherever the scene goes. The AI's creative input is in choosing who is in what room at which time (aside from a few key characters who need to be in certain places at certain times for story reasons.) 

It does also have a sort of tangential, accidental input, in that sometimes unless I refresh it by pasting the character list in again, the AI will begin to hallucinate characters who don't exist. Some of these characters and names, however, have been interesting enough that I did build them out and add them to the roster for later. None have been used yet, but there's at least one that I'm planning to use in the future.

AI: That's such an interesting dynamic - the AI essentially acting as a logistics coordinator, but then its "mistakes" becoming creative sparks. I love that you've embraced those hallucinated characters as potential story elements rather than just seeing them as errors.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI this way?

User: I find it much easier to get over my procrastination instincts and start the scene, actually - I have ADHD and I'm awful at logistics, on my worst days it makes my head actually hurt a little bit. Having an easy workaround for that is really helpful, especially on days when I can't take my medication.

It also, as I mentioned before, has made for much more interesting character pairings than I would have thought to make on my own - I like that it forces me to consider less-than-obvious dynamics, like how the King might converse with his son's friends in a casual, convival setting.

AI: That's really insightful - the way AI helps with both the executive function challenges and pushes you toward unexpected creative choices. The ADHD perspective is particularly valuable here - it sounds like AI is removing a barrier that was sometimes preventing you from getting to the creative work you actually enjoy.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm worried about the kids, honestly. I know how tempting it can be to use something like this as a crutch for the hard or boring stuff - if I had had the option of being able to put my thesis statement for an essay or something into an AI, and getting an already-finished outline back, I would have taken it every single time. But I would have been losing really valuable time exercising that mental muscle when I was young and still had the neuroplasticity for it to Really Take, and I have no doubt that I wouldn't be nearly as good a writer as I am today. And I probably would have wanted to roll my eyes at anyone trying to give me this warning, too. 

I'm also concerned at the sheer amount of what I'm going to call "AI Slop" (quickly, shoddily-made fiction generated entirely by an AI that was given no instructions about theme, message, or any other relevant content other than plot details, and therefore delivers very little human value relative to the time and effort it takes to read it) that seems to be widely available to read now. I know this makes me sound like a snob, but I truly feel like I never used to have to shuffle through so much empty-feeling fiction before I got to something good before. I see a lot of listings for it as an editor, and it's disheartening, because I really can tell the difference, and it loses something I can't put my finger on. It's like the uncanny valley for writing.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns. The neuroplasticity point about developing those mental muscles early is particularly striking - that there might be critical periods for learning to think through complex problems that could be bypassed too easily.

And your "uncanny valley for writing" observation is fascinating. You mentioned you can tell the difference - what do you think it is that you're sensing is missing in that AI-generated content, even if you can't quite put your finger on it?

User: I have almost no idea. I was like this with grammar when I was a kid, too - I could tell you immediately when something was wrong, but I usually had to look up the rule in order to be able to explain why. It was like it just hit my ear wrong or something. (It's why I became an editor.) It's the same thing with AI - I don't know if it's word choice or cadence or what, but I often just get that feeling, like something's just Off. A little too formulaic, maybe? Or too polished? Reads too much like textbook examples and the Better Answer Formula from like sixth grade? It varies, so it's hard to put a finger on exactly what it is, but those are my best guesses.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - that intuitive ear you have for language picking up on something subtly "off" about the rhythm or authenticity, even when the technical execution might be correct. It sounds like your experience as an editor has given you a really fine-tuned sense for authentic voice versus something more manufactured.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Well, first of all, I would definitely use it more if I could be assured the models I was using weren't guzzling gallons and gallons of water every time I ask a question. I do feel the guilt behind that weighing on me, which is one of the non-mental-exercise reasons I try to use it sparingly. 

That said, if and when that becomes a non-factor, I can see myself naming various assistant bots for different projects I work on - like Jarvis or Friday from the Iron Man movies, but specifically for individual universes I am working on or with. It'd be really cool if I could develop a kind of template for that, and then use it to help other writers, like a service or something.

I can also see myself using it for brainstorming and character dialogue-type stuff: I'm great at writing dialogue but not always great at coming up with the pretext to cover the subtext of important conversations. I feel like feeding character profiles into the right AI and asking it to just generate conversations and situations between them could spark some ideas for those types of things. 

I also see myself continuing to use it in another capacity I have not mentioned because it is not strictly creative: administrative tasks. Specifically: Emails, form letters, invoices, reminders, etc. I'm terrible at sounding professional in the traditional sense - I write exactly the way I talk, which is like a [REDACTED] who grew up on sitcoms and fan forums. I put what I want to say in normal person language, and the AI gives me back the professional email with all of the right terms (that I could not have remembered to use if you paid me) in all the right places. Expanding on that area of assistance - though I can't exactly imagine how - would be amazing for me.

AI: Those are really compelling future applications - the idea of project-specific AI assistants for different fictional universes is particularly creative. And it's interesting how you're thinking about potentially turning that into a service for other writers.

You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with the logistics that can be barriers to creativity, while also your concerns about preserving those crucial developmental opportunities for young writers.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That covers everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing such detailed and thoughtful insights about your creative process and how AI fits into it. Your perspective on using AI as a logistics coordinator rather than a creative generator, your concerns about skill development in young writers, and that fascinating observation about the "uncanny valley for writing" have all been incredibly valuable.

I found your approach particularly interesting - how you've found ways to preserve what you love about the creative process while using AI to remove barriers like complex organizational tasks that can trigger procrastination. And your vision for project-specific AI assistants is really innovative.

Thank you again for your time and for being so open about your experiences. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.
