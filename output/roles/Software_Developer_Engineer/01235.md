Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions, thanks.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The team and I have successfully completed fabrication of a passive exoskeleton prototype, which is based on Dr. A. van den Bogert's theorized "exotendon". A start-up company had already begun working on building a passive exoskeleton from this model, where I joined soon after. Using Dr. A. van den Bogert's kinematic model, we built homotopy-based optimization code to find optimal parameters for the prototype's spring rate and ankle/hip pulley sizes, maximizing mean assistive torque over a single walk gait. Once the actuation mechanism was parameterized, we dimensioned the leg brace via measurement and plaster/imaging. After modeling in Fusion360, we selected parts and 3D printed the brace bodies. These plastic bodies were then encased in carbon fiber, and the first prototype was assembled. Some slight design iterations were needed, but it worked pretty well and passed our verification tests, albeit unconfortably.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you took this from theoretical model all the way through to a working prototype. That's quite a journey involving optimization, design, manufacturing, and testing.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I didn't use AI tools much on this project, except in troubleshooting issues with my optimization code. I used ChatGPT, I think 4.0, and it was mostly helpful.

AI: Tell me more about that troubleshooting experience with ChatGPT. What kinds of issues were you running into with your optimization code, and how did ChatGPT help you work through them?

User: Using MATLAB, I most often ran into matrix multiplication errors. These errors were expected as I built a large portion of this code out of snippets from other code of mine. ChatGPT's ability to comb through and point out potential matrix issues was impressive and very helpful. An unexpected instance, memorably, was an issue in getting the homotopy observe set up correctly. I didn't quite get the concept but hacked at it anyway; ChatGPT was helpful here in helping me approach it with the right idea, but it also had trouble getting it to work. A few days later, I rebuilt the observer from scratch by following an article's example more closely, which worked out.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like ChatGPT was particularly good at spotting those matrix multiplication issues, which makes sense given how systematic those errors can be. And that homotopy observer situation is telling too - it helped you understand the concept better even when it couldn't fully solve the implementation.

For that troubleshooting work, tell me about how you decided whether to use ChatGPT versus your traditional approach of working through coding problems.

User: I don't quite remember my specific thought process when deciding to use ChatGPT for this project, but I often have it pulled up on a second monitor when coding. Before my use of AI, I had always wished there were a better way to find information through forums, since trudging through forums with no answers is a nightmare. ChatGPT felt like an answer to this wish, and played a big part in my learning of MATLAB. Now, I typically use ChatGPT as a sort of adaptive debugger so that I can better focus on the bigger picture.

AI: That's a great way to put it - an "adaptive debugger" that lets you focus on the bigger picture. It sounds like it's become pretty integrated into your coding workflow.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Thinking about the other parts of your exoskeleton project - the kinematic modeling, the Fusion360 design work, the materials selection, the testing - what kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I may have chatted with ChatGPT about some springs or alternative materials (like silicone). My limited use of it may have been due to its lacking capabilities, and for instance I wouldn't send it screenshots of my 3D model asking "how does this look?". Another reason is that I typically feel dishonest when using AI for work, even if I am clear about my use of it; while there isn't much pride to be had in churning through lists of matrix errors, I would feel more useless the more work it does for me.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - thank you for sharing that. The feeling of dishonesty or becoming "useless" when AI does more of the work is something I'm curious about. 

Can you tell me more about where that line is for you? You mentioned there's not much pride in churning through matrix errors, but there would be in other types of work - what makes the difference?

User: What makes the difference is subjective, I'm sure pride could be found in clearing up a mess of errors, like that found in removing weeds (I say having done too much landscaping haha). But personally, that arbitrary line is drawn near what I consider an artistic expression (like building a novel optimization model) or display of valuable aptitude (like designing and fabricating a leg/hip brace that actually fits). 'Pride' aside, these genuine puzzles are what makes engineering fun.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing a distinction between the mechanical troubleshooting work and the more creative, problem-solving aspects that make engineering enjoyable for you. The optimization model design and the custom brace fabrication sound like they fall into that "genuine puzzle" category.

When you have used ChatGPT for that troubleshooting work, how do you verify or validate what it suggests before implementing it in your code?

User: While certainly not the best method, I typically just inject it's suggestions into my code, hit 'Run', send it the new error (if present), and repeat until no errors are present in that section. This is to save time, as fixes that still produce errors are likely incorrect. If all errors are resolved, I then comb through the code section to ensure that everything looks right. Depending on the use, I try to limit substantial deviation between the final debugged version and my original attempt. Combing through its fixes are very telling and is pretty much how I learned MATLAB.

AI: That's an iterative approach that seems to work well for learning - using the trial-and-error cycle to not just fix the code but understand MATLAB better in the process. It sounds like you're using the fixes as teaching moments.

We're about two-thirds through our conversation now. Here's a forward-looking question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Assistance with trouble shooting 3D printer issues would have been very helpful. The team and I got hung up on some issues with a newly bought 3D printer, and after a week or so of scratching our heads we ended up returning it. It would have been nice to insert a magic USB that could gather info and report potential issues/fixes.

AI: That's a really practical example - a week of troubleshooting that ended in returning the printer sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you're trying to move a project forward. The idea of diagnostic AI that could actually interface with the hardware and gather real-time data is compelling.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as an "adaptive debugger" while maintaining that line around the creative, puzzle-solving aspects of engineering were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't have anything else to share. Thank you for the interview, it was a pleasure speaking with you!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about drawing that line between mechanical troubleshooting and the creative engineering work - and how AI fits as a debugging tool while preserving the "genuine puzzles" that make engineering fun - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It was a pleasure speaking with you too, and I truly appreciate the time you took to walk me through your exoskeleton project and your thoughtful approach to AI integration. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you again!
