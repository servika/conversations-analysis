Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me, let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, I work in a fairly rigid environment where data is taken very seriously. As a result, even in code, I have to have conversations and use AI like it's Google instead of copy and pasting things in or giving exact lines of code or context. This means that it's mostly a research tool and a copilot. I also use it for writing up tickets and summaries of work

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like your workplace has specific constraints around how you can interact with AI tools. 

When you say you have to use AI "like it's Google instead of copy and pasting things in," can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? How does that change the way you approach getting help with your work?

User: Sure. It means that I have to know what I need to do to approach a ticket, or write a hypothetical scenario that my ticket applies to as well as providing the context of my work environment. I then need to work with the model and refine it so that it understands the context and is proposing viable solutions in the setting. It can be challenging at times but because I work in Scala, it's still far more efficient than scouring Google and finding 10 year old stack overflow articles that are not longer valid

AI: That paints a vivid picture - working through hypothetical scenarios and iterating to build understanding rather than just dropping in your actual code. And it sounds like even with those constraints, you're finding real value, especially with Scala where current resources can be hard to find.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I love working through frontend or design tasks without the support of the model, although sometimes I'll turn to AI to speed up mundane processes (such as assigning unique IDs to a bunch of elements). The actual design, layout and presentation elements are enjoyable for me though so I tend not to utilise AI for these kinds of instances.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - you enjoy the creative, visual aspects of frontend work but you're happy to let AI handle the repetitive parts like generating unique IDs.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I don't tend to trust AI to complete entire tasks it can handle independently. My work requires lots of context and I cannot permit AI to access the entire codebase. As a result, I can only use AI in a productive and useful way by collaborating with it and holding its hand along the way. If I were to expect AI to handle complete tasks alone it would likely make way too many assumptions to be directly relevant to my context. I prefer to collaborate and build step by step and offer feedback as I go.

AI: That makes perfect sense given your security constraints - you can't give AI the full picture, so you need to guide it through each step while maintaining control over the context and assumptions.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: There's a reluctance to admit we use AI, it's often not talked about very openly and exists under a veil of secrecy. In a sense, it feels like cheating because we are expected not to be overly reliant on AI and are forbidden from copying code into it. However, there are moments when AI is discussed with enthusiasm. In the day to day though, despite a really positive and open workplace culture, AI isn't something that's looked at as a positive in our daily work

AI: That tension you're describing is really striking - having to keep AI use somewhat hidden despite it being helpful, and feeling like it might be perceived as "cheating." 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied? Sure, when debugging errors and bugs that I haven't seen before. Scala is not a very Googleable programming language so AI really goes a long way to streamline my work in this area. Where I have found it particularly frustrating is where I need to figure out a solution to a problem; for example, I had to implement a new email that would be sent when a download fails but this is done in a very convoluted way across several services in my employment. AI made so many assumptions that working with AI as I attempted to implement it actually slowed me down. I had to step away and delete solutions multiple times and give the AI more context than would've been reasonable in my role if I wanted to get anywhere with it. As a result, I ended up working through it over a longer duration without AI, due to the complexities in the process and the sheer pool of assumptions AI persistently kept making.

AI: That's such a clear example of when AI collaboration breaks down - when the problem is too embedded in your specific system architecture for AI to be helpful without more context than you can safely provide.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As a former teacher too, I am no stranger to the talk about AI 'taking over'. I don't have concerns here to be honest. AI is a fantastic tool when people know how to wield it but is not often as effective as some people make it out to be when left to make decisions and determine its own correctness. I will continue to keep these kinds of skills sharp because I will need to do so to ensure AI is able to perform adequately in these roles. To assume AI's correctness in any situation like this is a risk I don't intend to ever take.

AI: That perspective from your teaching background really comes through - seeing AI as a tool that requires skilled operation rather than a replacement. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope that my employment will look to explore ways to incorporate AI positively into our workday. Over time, as the relationship with AI becomes more positive, I would hope it would allow us to build more, better, faster and more often. Currently the production process is so buried in bureaucracy that we spend more time twiddling our thumbs than actually coding. It would be nice to see AI utilised to streamline these processes and push the boundaries of ambition.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the hidden nature of AI use in your workplace and how the security constraints shape your collaboration patterns with AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, nothing. Thank you for your time

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use within security constraints, the cultural tensions around AI adoption, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining skills while leveraging AI as a tool will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
