Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, and no, proceed!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I build pedals from scratch. This means I often choose a tried and true circuit and expand upon it or change it some way to make it my own. I then either purchase an enclosure or make it. Then, I make wood faceplate that is slightly smaller than the face of the enclosure, and I stain it and finish it nice and smooth. Then, I apply waterslide decals with graphics I've created and seal them in with more coats of finish. I do all the work myself, including making the PCBs out of stripboard, drilling all my enclosures, and doing all of the soldering and component purchasing myself. I sell them. I make custom ones often, as well, and what started as a hobby quickly grew into a business where I repair electronics faster than they can be picked up by the customers, and I sell so many of my original pedals I rarely have any of my own to play around with. I spend a lot of time on each project; probably more than is necessary. It's impossible, honestly, to get the hours for each pedal down. It's a week at least, with 12-hour days sometimes, and only 4-hour days other times.

AI: Wow, that sounds like an incredibly hands-on and meticulous process - from circuit design all the way through to the final graphics and finishing. The level of craftsmanship you're describing is really impressive, especially managing both the technical electronics work and the artistic elements like the wood faceplates and custom graphics.

It sounds like you've got your hands full with both custom orders and repairs! 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sometimes it's as simple as coming up with new names for controls or effects, but sometimes it's also about understanding parts of a circuit I may not understand correctly. Usually, it's to better understand elements of electrical engineering in which I'm lacking. That said, I'd really like to utilize it for Bill of Materials compilations, circuit theory (testing?), as well as providing me with the best of the abundance of sources for components. Also, awareness of existing circuits. Almost like, a wizard librarian with his eye out for the best price and the most up-to-date info on component availability, and if not, what actually is suitable, including alternate pinouts if applicable, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - so AI is serving multiple roles for you, from the creative naming side to being almost like a technical consultant and sourcing assistant. 

Tell me more about how you currently use AI to understand circuit elements you're not familiar with. What does that interaction typically look like for you?

User: I feel like I am dyslexic with signal flow, as well as understanding some concepts that might seem basic. In particular, I am developing a synthesizer, and I have a harder time understanding things like when a summing amp is necessary and when it isn't. Or, another example might be discussing diode clipping and cascades...knowledge about what different diode configurations are known to produce is helpful so I know if I'm barking up a tree that's been barked up to much. As far as interactions go...I feel like I get some practical understanding out of the conversation, but my confidence is still kind of low. What if the info is wrong?

AI: That concern about accuracy really resonates - especially when you're working with circuits where getting it wrong could mean a lot of wasted time and materials. The confidence issue you mention seems particularly important when you're pushing into new territory like synthesizer development.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: A practical example is asking how to get PCB files to order PCBs without the usually necessary gerber file. I have, in the example, a jpg or pdf of a PCB layout, and a complete BOM; how do I proceed? I got stiffed by someone years ago and I'm trying to reverse engineer their work. I have my business name literally copyrighted on the image of the PCB layout...I just don't have the gerber. The instruction was to recreate the layout from scratch, which was ultimately what I had to do, and the resources for that were helpful too. I then kind of proceeded to learn how easy it was to use EasyEDA with AI. It took about a year, but now I'm making them with no problems thanks to that one conversation. It kind of set me off from converting my stripboards to proper PCBs for the final sale models.

AI: That's a really compelling example - it sounds like that one conversation ended up being a real turning point for your business, opening up a whole new capability with PCB design. And the fact that it took a year to fully implement shows how that initial AI guidance rippled out into genuine skill development.

When you're working with AI on these technical questions - like in that PCB situation or when you're trying to understand circuit concepts - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I always feel like I'm the one driving the conversation and the AI is being somewhat over-supportive at times; I'd prefer it if a better approach was recommended as an alternative. For example, in the case of the PCB design, I was also given the recommendation to hire a circuit designer. This could've also been a successful approach, and putting the ball in my court for that one was very helpful. I did weigh that option, but since I'd been screwed before by a hired circuit designer (which I hadn't told the AI), I chose the DIY approach.

AI: That's really insightful - you're looking for AI to be more of a thoughtful advisor that presents multiple paths rather than just being encouraging about whatever direction you're already heading. It sounds like you value having those alternatives laid out so you can make informed decisions based on your full context, including past experiences the AI might not know about.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Yeah, it's almost like, there's a balance between the tailored approach and the "generally best" approach; I'd like them both laid out.

To answer your question, probably research streamlining. I would like to say BoM compilations, but I just don't need to do that with Excel until I find a model that can combine multiple BoMs into one without error, including up-to-date components with equivalents when necessary.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having both the customized advice for your specific situation and the broader "best practice" approach gives you the full picture to work with.

The research streamlining sounds like it's been a significant time-saver for you. And it's interesting that you're holding back on the BoM work until the accuracy and reliability gets to where you need it to be - that seems to tie back to your earlier concern about confidence in the information.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: None. AI can't repair broken electronics or handmake these boutique pedal, at least not yet hehe. If anything, my concerns are that the AI assistant I'm looking for is too far away.

AI: Ha! That's a great perspective - the hands-on craftsmanship and repair work you do really does seem pretty AI-proof for now.

Tell me more about that AI assistant you're looking for being "too far away." What would that ideal assistant look like for your work?

User: I feel like I already laid all that out; I'm happy to do so if you can't cycle through all that, but it's  basically a circuit wizard...we're talking population and design, demonstration with component swapability, essentially AI software for circuit design, and then a BoM compiler of course, with all that stuff I said. Again, I'm happy to say it again, but I feel like I did make all that pretty clear. I understand it's a lot.

AI: You're absolutely right - you laid that out very clearly earlier. I was curious if there were additional aspects beyond what you'd already described so well: the wizard librarian for component sourcing and pricing, the circuit theory guidance, BoM compilation with error-free component equivalents, and that broader circuit design software capability.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Hopefully I can rely on it more; I'd like to upload an image of an old stripboard build with components labeled in the picture and create a BoM for me. Then I can input other projects I'm adding to it, and the results are true...I won't go to build them all like I have in the past and realize the AI messed up and I'm short a dozen resistors or something. Being more reliable and proven as such, so then I can actually invest in it as a paid assistant if necessary, because it would certainly be cheaper than a human one. But it needs to have some initiative as well. And it needs to be intuitive and accurate.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting AI to present both tailored and "generally best" approaches, and your vision for that circuit wizard assistant that could handle everything from component identification to reliable BoM generation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. The way you've described both the current limitations you're working around and your clear vision for what would actually be useful in your field gives us a lot to think about.

Best of luck with your pedal business and that synthesizer development - it sounds like you're doing some really impressive work!
