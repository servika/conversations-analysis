Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Okay! I don't have any questions so far.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work as professional freelance copy and content writer. I write ads for clients, landing pages, blog posts, write some for social media, a lot of different things. A typical project includes every step from brainstorming the idea with the client, to extensive competitor research, to creating the ad/web page/blog, proofreading/editing, and finalizing all deliverables.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive process with a lot of different moving parts. I can see how you're involved from the very beginning conceptual stages all the way through to the final polish.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I usually lean on AI for the brainstorming and research portion, and then again for the proof-reading and editing.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does the brainstorming and research look like when you're using AI?

User: If I'm starting a new project, like a blog for example, and the topic is rather broad, I'll first tell AI the general outline for the project I have in my head and ask the model to identify any gaps and expand on my outline.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using it almost like a thought partner to help you see what you might be missing. When you get that feedback from the AI about gaps or expansions, how do you work with those suggestions? Do you typically take them as-is, or do they spark other ideas for you?

User: Usually, I'll have them incorporated into the outline with a little bit of personal tweaking. Then I'll continue the process until I feel like I have a full outline. Often, the AI is TOO comprehensive for my required word counts and I find myself cutting out bits of the outline as I actually write the piece.

AI: That's a really practical insight - that the AI tends to be overly thorough for your actual needs. So it sounds like you're using it to generate more possibilities than you'll actually use, then you're the one making the editorial decisions about what to keep.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently, I wrote an entire landing page for a brand new health teach startup that had just launched their new health tracking app and community platform. I had NO idea what beats I should hit on the final landing page, it was the first time I had written one in this niche or for this type of product, so I first had the AI assistant outline a basic skeleton for the page. And then as I started filling in areas, sent my finished text back to be polished and placed into the outline. As I wrote, the outline started to evolve.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic process - almost like the AI was helping you navigate unfamiliar territory at first, but then you took the lead as you got more comfortable with the project. 

When you say the outline started to evolve as you wrote, tell me more about that. Was that you making those changes, or were you bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI?

User: I would realize the next section of the outline was too broad or too deeply technical, and I would issue the corrections to the model. Then I would write the section based off the updated outline.

AI: So you were really driving those refinements - recognizing when something wasn't quite right for the audience or scope and directing the AI to adjust. 

When you're working with AI this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm definitely in charge of all of the creative decisions. The AI assistant helps out, but it doesn't really suggest anything new or innovative. I have to be the one driving the project and identifying when the outline no longer fits my purpose.

AI: That's a really clear perspective - you see yourself as firmly in the driver's seat. You mentioned that AI doesn't suggest anything new or innovative. What do you think it does bring to the table then? What's valuable about having it in your process?

User: It really speeds up the entire process. Plus, because I work as a freelancer, I spend the bulk of my working hours alone without any outside interaction. I find the AI assistant incredibly valuable for bouncing ideas off of and for really having something to talk through roadblocks with. But I don't have the AI actually do the writing for me.

AI: That's fascinating - so beyond the practical efficiency gains, it's also serving as a kind of creative companion when you're working in isolation. The social aspect of having something to think through problems with seems really important.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I find myself starting at a blank page WAY less than I did before. I used to find the hardest part of the process getting started, but AI really helps me get something onto the page. Even if its an outline I don't really end up using, it helps me start getting my thoughts flowing.

AI: That's such a relatable challenge - that intimidating blank page! It sounds like AI has become a really effective way to break through that initial creative paralysis, even when what it produces isn't your final direction.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I read online ALL the time about how AI assistants are going to make jobs like mine completely obsolete. I love writing and it is really my passion. I am nervous that AI might make it so my job no longer includes much writing and instead will be a whole lot more editing and prompting. 

Plus, AI is not always truthful. I worry it may start hurting human writer's credibility.

AI: Those are really understandable concerns. The idea that the core thing you're passionate about - the actual writing - might get squeezed out in favor of more editing and prompting sounds genuinely worrying. And that credibility issue is interesting too.

When you think about that potential shift toward more editing and prompting, what would that mean for you personally? How would that feel different from the work you do now?

User: Since, I now have experience training AI models and working with them extensively I hope I will be able to transition into one of those new editing and prompting roles easily. But it will take some of the fun and creativity out of my job. I'll get to do less thinking and have fewer original ideas.

AI: That tension is really striking - you recognize you'd likely be well-positioned for that transition given your experience, but at the cost of what makes the work fulfilling for you in the first place. The "less thinking and fewer original ideas" part seems like it would fundamentally change the nature of what draws you to this work.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Yeah, definitely. Just in the few years I've trained AI, I've seen it change so much. Where models used to struggle with short form blogs, they now blow some junior or untrained writers out of the water. I see AI eliminating a lot of entry roles and leaving space only for the folks, like myself, who have learned how to leverage this technology.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about how the bar has shifted so quickly. It sounds like you see a future where working effectively with AI becomes an essential skill rather than just a nice-to-have.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as both a practical tool for overcoming creative blocks and a kind of creative companion when you're working alone, while you maintain clear creative control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yeah, I think it's really important to draw attention to the fact that writing needs a human element to really connect with readers. People can spot AI because it isn't capable of adding that distinctly human element to the text. AI text still requires so much refinement to sound truly human.

AI: That's such an important point - that human connection and authenticity that readers can sense. It sounds like you see that as something AI fundamentally can't replicate, no matter how sophisticated it gets technically.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as a collaborative tool, the concerns about the evolution of writing roles, and especially that point about the irreplaceable human element in connecting with readers - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your candor about both the benefits and the genuine concerns you have about where this is all heading.

User: No problem

AI: Thank you so much! Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your creative work.
