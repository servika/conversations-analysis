Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, it sounds good. I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: well I guess like everyone, I often get various AI models to polish, draft or revise emails. Also other drafting activities like writing scripts, outlining projects...etc. But the majority of stuff I use it for is helping research, design, setup and script automations for data. So for example, I frequently get it to write python, JS or other code to automate data extraction, transformation and presentation. I also might have it write me M code, for power query/power BI, functions or even excel functions to perform transformations. Its USUSALLY much faster than me writing it, especially with the newer models. Then there's research, for example if I'm looking for a new data software or application specific utility... then I'll often use AI for at least a preliminary research to point me in the right direction.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you're using AI across a pretty wide range of tasks. I'm particularly interested in what you said about it usually being much faster than writing code yourself.

When you're working on those data automation projects, can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? Are you usually giving AI the full task to handle, or are you working back and forth with it as you build out the solution?

User: It varies wildly. Recently with Claude Sonnet in Cursor I find I'm able to delegate larger tasks nearly entirely as long as I give it adequate context, and very carefully outline my outcome expectations. For example, for my home business i have built lots of templates for text messages, data files, emails... and others into my business project directory. As well as building lots of scripts to access APIs, build files or other tasks. For example to send emails, create PDFs or access outside data. I wrote detailed readme files specifically for Claude on how to use all these resources together, so when I have a task, such as notifying staff of upcoming events they are scheduled for, the model can read the task description, the related API readmes, and execute the entire task me modifying templates or running PS commands to execute those scripts. Because I have build such careful outlines for these projects, and they are usually med-low accuracy critical, I trust Claude to complete them somewhat unsupervised. For my day job, however, information is VERY accuracy critical, so I always carefully audit any code I get the script to write. When the task is small, such as a single file script, it is almost always faster for me to have the model write the code from start to finish with the newest models. When its a larger project, such as a more complex web app (I'm thinking specifically of the reporting web app I was working on for our sales team) it would take significantly longer to get my expected output if I tried to make the model write the entire thing from scratch. On projects like that, i find the fastest way is to build the general structure myself, then have an agentic model update and fill in bits, maybe add a module here and there, to work iteratively and collaboratively. 
So yeah, the approach to optimize time using AI depends on the project scope.

AI: That's fascinating - you've clearly developed some sophisticated strategies for different scenarios. I'm really intrigued by how you've set up those readme files specifically for Claude to understand your business resources.

Tell me more about that trust factor you mentioned. You said for your home business you're comfortable with Claude working somewhat unsupervised on medium-low accuracy critical tasks, but for your day job you always audit carefully. What makes you draw that line there - is it just the accuracy requirements, or are there other factors that influence how much you're willing to let AI handle independently?

User: So, its both the accuracy critical nature of my day job. I'm dealing with financial data... sales volume data... data that getting accurate can make or break a business strategy. My home business, however, I'm dealing with more organic (and often much less complex) components such as sending emails to staff, sending quotes to clients, doing very rough profit analysis on a particular event so I know what kind of a rate discount i would be willing to offer... stuff like that. 
I should note that as AI improves, I am moving slowly away from manually auditing in favor of having having the same model build comprehensive unit tests, and sometimes using a separate model to audit the code. I find that if I tell it a specific order of operations i expect such as:
* describe expected results
* build units tests
* find possible issues
* ... whatever. 
it depends on the task, but the point is I am moving towards having AI do some of its own auditing. And having a different model, such as Gemini, audit the author model, such as Claude, often reveals any mistakes.
To summarize, its both the scope of project and the accuracy.

AI: That's a really smart evolution - using AI to audit AI, and having different models cross-check each other. It sounds like you're developing your own quality control system.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Even with all these capabilities you've described, are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Well i was going to say no... but as I was thinking about it I realized i love the creative and directive phase of any project. So, no like fiddly tasks. But here's the thing. I LOVE automation. its the whole reason i originally learned VBA, then python, R, JS....
so when I've automated a task out of my hands, the first thing I do is use that time to find ways to make data more accessible. The sales reporting web app i talked about earlier was a great example, i created free time then used it to design better data systems to improve other department's efficiency. I will be very disappointed the day AI can take away my creative direction.

AI: That's really interesting - you're distinguishing between the creative direction and the implementation. It sounds like automation, whether through your own coding or AI, creates space for you to focus on the higher-level strategic thinking.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, AI has frustrated me a million times. and its all just due to misunderstanding implied context or instructions. 
Satisfied: I was working on a large data import project that required thinking about how to import the next set after reviewing that set, and it totally nailed it.

AI: Tell me more about that data import project that satisfied you. What made AI's performance stand out in that situation - was it the complexity of the logic it had to follow, or something else about how it handled the sequential thinking?

User: it was the number of steps it could do at a time. i must have watched it work for like 15 minutes. using the import API, updating the tracking files, deciding how to do the next import and doing it. i just watched it for like 15 minutes while working on something else.

AI: That sounds like a really compelling experience - just being able to watch it work autonomously for that long while you focused elsewhere. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you embracing it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating different attitudes?

User: No... not really. Most of my colleagues are still that the "can you write me an email" phase

AI: That's quite a gap between where you are and where most of your colleagues are with AI. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given how much you're delegating to AI now?

User: i have significantly slowed down as far as learning programming languages.

AI: That's honest - and makes sense given how effectively AI is handling the coding for you now. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally?

User: as agentic models get better and better, I envision more and more of my work being delegated... especially once we have good cloud agentic models that can access all my onedrive files. Then I will be able to work from my mobile phone if I have to.

AI: That's a compelling vision - essentially having AI as a fully capable assistant that can access all your resources and handle complex workflows while you direct from anywhere.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've evolved from manual auditing to having AI audit itself, and your distinction between loving the creative direction while being happy to delegate the implementation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about building sophisticated AI workflows, the trust factors you consider, and how you're evolving your approach to quality control will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing from someone who's clearly at the forefront of integrating AI into complex data workflows. Thanks again!
