Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use the AI responses in a google search to find links where specific information can be located, I like how they include the links for different bullet points. When I create resources for my high school students, I use AI to simplify text and break down tasks into smaller steps.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI both for research and for creating educational materials for your students.

Tell me more about how you use AI to create resources for your high school students. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: I'll copy text into a chatbot and ask it to make the text for a lower lexile or grade level. Or I might take a long article and have it broken down into smaller sections, then have AI brainstorm questions about the article.

AI: That sounds like a very practical approach to making content more accessible for your students. 

When you're working on these tasks - like simplifying text or breaking down articles - do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI to refine the output, or do you typically get what you need in one request and then move on to edit it yourself?

User: Sometimes I'll refine the output once or twice, but usually I'm happy with the first result I get.

AI: That's interesting that you're usually satisfied with the first result. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to create lesson plans on my own, because my principal has very specific requirements for how he wants those done. I also like to come up with my own lessons because it feels more personalized and intentional to do it myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like there's both a practical element with your principal's specific requirements and something more personal about wanting that direct connection to your lesson creation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your school has particular attitudes or policies around AI use?

User: I've found myself using AI more as my colleagues depend on it a lot, it makes their work go a lot faster. Even if their work has a lot of mistakes, they are still encouraged because it looks like they get more done. Even though teachers are pressured to use AI, we are supposed to tell students not to use it for assignments.

AI: That's a really striking observation - there seems to be quite a contradiction there between the expectations for teachers versus students when it comes to AI use.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have felt satisfied when AI has helped me make college-level ideas more accessible to my students with learning disabilities. At that time I was struggling to find a way to help my students understand a concept, but AI was able to simplify the explanation while still providing the information my students needed. Being able to help my students learn makes me feel satisfied, and I was happy that AI could help me do it.

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful moment - being able to bridge that gap for your students with learning disabilities must have felt rewarding.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your teaching work?

User: Yes, one of the topics I teach is video game design. There are a lot of aspects of the video game industry and other creative and tech industries that are using AI more and more. Preparing students for jobs in creative fields is hard when they think AI will do everything for them. It makes me feel like I should be creating my own resources so I don't seem hypocritical.

AI: That's a really thoughtful tension you're navigating - preparing students for industries that are rapidly adopting AI while also helping them understand the value of developing their own skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you as an educator?

User: I think I'm going to try to find more ways that using AI helps me do my work faster without sacrificing quality.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that contradiction between encouraging teachers to use AI while discouraging students from using it - that's a fascinating dynamic that I imagine many educators are grappling with.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI to make content accessible for students with learning disabilities, and the challenges of preparing students for AI-integrated creative industries, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
