Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good and I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I utilize AI to help me gather resources and to write notes. I work as a case manager/service coordinator in a large US city/county, but also need to access resources in surrounding counties. I primarily work with individuals who have a dual diagnosis (MH/SUD) and who are typically homeless. I use AI to help me gather a cohesive list of resources specific to the individual I'm working with. For example, if I'm working with a male who is in need of emergency housing, I will utilize AI to give me a quick and accessible list of shelters and drop in centers in the area. I also utilize AI in a similar way when searching for things like food banks or resources for clothing/hygiene products. Each interaction with a collateral source or the individual I'm working with requires a service note that recounts the interaction. I often ask AI for assistance in writing these notes, which is extremely helpful because it reduces my mental load. I also utilize AI to help me with scheduling my face to face session to ensure I'm compliant with my states regulations.

AI: That sounds like AI is really integrated into several key aspects of your work. You mentioned using it to reduce your mental load when writing service notes - could you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: Sure. Writing service notes is typically a time-consuming and redundant task. Each note must provide all data from the session - so basically the session format, how time was spent with the individual, what interventions were introduced during the session, what topics were discussed, and anything else deemed "significant" about the interaction. Along with the data, an overview of the clients response to the session, an assessment of client progress, an assessment of their disposition, items to follow-up on for the individual and the clinician, and the next scheduled service date must all be included. I typically need to write 6-10 service notes per workday, so five days per week - minimum.  Utilizing AI has streamlined this process and made it less time consuming/exhausting.  Here is a breakdown of the process: I currently have an on-going conversation with the AI model I use. Within this conversation, I have informed the model of the type of notes I'm writing, the population I serve, the format of the note, and I have given the model instructions on what needs to be included in each note. For each note, I provide the model with a summary of the interaction I'm documenting and the model returns a note that follows the instructions I provided. If there are any errors with the notes produced, I typically ask the model to revise the note and provide clarification, but sometime's I just edit it on my own without providing any feedback or asking for a model revision.

AI: That's fascinating how you've set up that ongoing conversation to essentially train the AI on your specific documentation requirements. When you provide that summary of the interaction to the AI, how detailed do you typically make it? Are you giving bullet points, or more of a narrative, or something else entirely?

User: I make it as detailed as I need to for that specific situation. For example, if the session was spent taking someone grocery shopping, I provide a fairly simple/high-level summary and ask the model to ensure the note says that I helped budget and select items within the individuals dietary needs. However, if the individual was in-crisis during the interaction the summary I provide is much more detailed. I generally provide the information in a narrative style, without good punctuation or grammar.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - matching the detail level to the complexity of the situation. You mentioned that when there are errors in the notes, sometimes you ask the AI to revise and sometimes you just edit it yourself. What typically drives that decision for you - when do you choose one approach over the other?

User: It really depends on my mood that day and the complexity of the issue with the note. If the model completely forgot to add something I asked for and I'm unsure how to phrase the sentence, then I'll ask for a revision. However, if it's just an issue with phrasing or something similar, I'll just correct it.

AI: That's a really practical approach. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I can't think of any areas where AI is available in my professional life but I choose not to use it.

AI: Interesting - so you're pretty comfortable leveraging AI wherever it can be helpful. When you are using AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with AI in my day-to-day life. Since I work in human services, and in a direct-service role, there aren't many projects or tasks that AI can complete on my behalf that I can think of.

AI: That makes perfect sense given the nature of your work with clients. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently than your coworkers?

User: I'm navigating it differently. I find that I utilize AI resources more than my coworkers. The organization that I work in only recently adopted an electronic medical record, so they aren't the most tech forward.

AI: It sounds like you're somewhat of an early adopter compared to your workplace. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't say that AI has made me feel frustrated in my professional life. However, the use of AI to help me write notes more efficiently has resulted in some satisfaction. AI has also been very helpful in writing engagement letters and services plans, especially in helping me find new ways to phrase the same statement. That has been a satisfying experience, overall.

AI: That's great that you've had such positive experiences with it. You mentioned that AI helps you find new ways to phrase the same statement for engagement letters and service plans. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Oh, absolutely! I'm not necessarily worried about my skills being reduced because I don't rely on the models to write everything for me. In many ways, the model is acting like a co-worker giving a suggestion, which helps me upgrade my skills. It's important to me that my written and verbal communication skills aren't weakened, so I'm mindful.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to frame it - as a co-worker providing suggestions. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it expanding into other areas, or changing in some way?

User: I see it expanding. I think there are opportunities for AI to be very helpful in my role, such as tracking direct service goals/productivity or maintaining a mileage log as examples.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on viewing AI as a collaborative co-worker that provides suggestions rather than something that might weaken your skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's it...thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in case management and human services work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how candidly you discussed your practical approach to integrating these tools into such important work.

Have a great rest of your day!
