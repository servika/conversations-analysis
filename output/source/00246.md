Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Often as a translator and especially when functioning as an interpreter, I am required to gain a reasonable amount of expertise on any given subject. The setting might be a remote hearing, or a video interview, but the subject can be any work environment. I am rarely afforded the recommended thirty minutes to prepare any specialized word list that I might need that can relate from engineering to drywall. I am human, so my memory is not perfect. AI has filled the gaps for me in a great way. I am not dependent on my use of AI, but that is what makes a successful collaboration. Years ago I would hire an assistant to help, but AI has been superior in preparing me for interpreting. In translation I can have a conversation that familiarizes me with a topic that I could not have with my dictionaries or encyclopedias. This has improved my translations by providing me with context and understanding, not just facts. My dictionaries were often wrong, or out of date. Now I can verify against an intelligent helper. The creativity is always mine, but AI has also sparked ideas even when providing statements that I don't use.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become a really valuable preparation partner for you. You mentioned that AI helps you gain expertise quickly on diverse subjects, from engineering to drywall.

Tell me more about those conversations you have with AI to familiarize yourself with topics. What does that process actually look like for you?

User: The terms that I need are often provided by a conversation. It can be as simple as asking for a brief on drywall or water management. I can then quickly verify with trusted reference materials and proceed with my work. Often I can ask for a report and have a PDF that I can scan quickly, highlighting terms as I go. This has been useful in translations involving food or other regionally dependent topics.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. You mentioned you can quickly verify the AI's information with trusted reference materials - that suggests you've found a way to balance using AI while maintaining quality control.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Over the years, I have compiled my own files and references digitally and in paper files. Interpreting usually means traveling and less time to physically search paper. AI has been very helpful by narrowing my verification and reference.

AI: I see - so AI helps you narrow down what you need to verify from your own compiled references, especially when you're traveling and can't access your paper files as easily.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Ethically, I usually can not delegate more than compiling a report that is solely for my consumption and education. I digest everything provided for me from the AI, and then submit original work with my own language, flaws and all. I strive for professional results.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - using AI for your own education and preparation, but ensuring the final work is authentically yours. It sounds like you have clear ethical boundaries around this.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: HIPAA is often the law governing my work. I think I have always been ready for AI help, maybe more so than many colleagues because of age. Translation is a dying art, and people get old. There are many unfounded worries about security and privacy. Then there are real concerns about HIPAA compliance. If I am working through and organization, usually the devices I use must be approved. More is left to my best judgment in freelance settings.

AI: That's really insightful - you're navigating both generational differences and real regulatory constraints like HIPAA compliance. It sounds like the organizational versus freelance settings give you different levels of flexibility.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Wearable tech has some catching up to do. I have been disappointed with the model that works through my glasses. It is nothing like working with the leading models such as Claude and others in its class.

AI: That sounds frustrating - having such a big difference in quality between the models you can access through wearable tech versus the more powerful ones like Claude.

Tell me more about that situation. What were you trying to accomplish with the wearable tech, and how did the limitations affect your work?

User: I would have trouble understanding my questions, and chastise me for asking for a better answer.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - having the AI misunderstand your questions and then essentially blame you for asking for clarification. That must have been particularly challenging when you're trying to prepare quickly for interpreting work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My openness to AI has given me a work advantage that I believe will grow my participation in my field. AI will replace those who do not adapt or understand that the full potential of AI will always involve a positive and collaborative partnership with a capable human. I see opportunity where others see their retirement.

AI: That's a really compelling perspective - viewing AI as creating opportunity rather than displacement through collaborative partnership. You mentioned seeing this as a work advantage that will grow your participation in the field.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As security becomes verifiable, I would want AI assisting at all times during work.

AI: That's an interesting vision - having AI assistance available continuously during your work once security concerns are resolved.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on viewing AI as creating opportunity through collaborative partnership, and how you've established clear ethical boundaries around using AI for preparation while ensuring your final work remains authentically yours.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not at this time. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a preparation partner in translation and interpreting work, while maintaining ethical boundaries and professional authenticity, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've navigated the balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and maintaining the quality and integrity of your work. Thank you again!
