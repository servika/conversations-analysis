Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, we can begin

AI: Great! Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI for activity ideas when lesson planning

AI: That's interesting - so you're in education. Tell me more about how you use AI when you're planning lessons. What does that process look like for you?

User: Sometimes I ask for engaging activities I can use for various learning goals if I'm struggling to come up with a fun and engaging activity for my class

AI: I see - so you turn to AI when you're looking for that spark of creativity to make lessons more engaging. 

Walk me through what happens when you're in one of those moments where you're struggling to come up with something fun. How do you typically approach asking AI for help with those activity ideas?

User: I typically say something along the ideas of  ' fun/engaging classroom activity for [learning objective]'

AI: Got it - you keep your requests pretty straightforward and focused. 

When AI gives you those activity suggestions, what happens next? Do you typically take one of the ideas and run with it as-is, or do you find yourself adapting and changing things to fit your specific classroom?

User: if it seems like it could work for a certain class or group, i'll modify it

AI: So you're doing that evaluation - seeing if it fits your particular students and then tailoring it. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your lesson planning or teaching that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: typically with grading and writing out assessments, i feel like i *could* use AI, but since i'm working with student information, i don't feel comfortable doing so

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the privacy aspect is a real consideration when working with student data.

Beyond the privacy concerns though, are there other aspects of your teaching work where you prefer to maintain that personal touch or handle things yourself, even in areas where student privacy isn't a factor?

User: maybe with making instructions for handouts, but even then, I might request that the AI double check my instructions to see if they could be clearer, and then make the worksheet/handout myself

AI: So you're comfortable having AI as that second pair of eyes to review and improve your work. That's a nice balance.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task - like bouncing ideas back and forth - or do you tend to give it a request and let it handle something independently?

User: well i make the request first, and if i feel the ideas aren't sufficient, i'll bounce ideas back and forth

AI: That's a really practical approach - starting with a straightforward request and then getting more collaborative if needed.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about AI use with other teachers, or is it something you've largely figured out on your own?

User: i've mostly figured it out on my own. I used to ask my colleagues to bounce ideas for activities, but it's been nice working with AI and my colleagues

AI: That's an interesting shift - it sounds like AI has become another resource alongside your colleagues rather than replacing those conversations entirely.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: it'd probably be for one of my classes on auxiliary verbs. i was teaching them to a lower level ESL class, so it was a bit interesting trying to come up with different activities my students could do to make it more engaging. I like incorporating a physical activity sometimes to make the class stand up and have some fun. so i asked for some activities i could do

AI: That sounds like a great example of using AI for exactly the kind of creative challenge you mentioned earlier. 

What happened when you asked for those physical activities for teaching auxiliary verbs? Did AI give you something that worked well, or did you run into any challenges with the suggestions?

User: i applied one of the ideas and made it into a sort of matching game for the class. it went pretty well, but there was definitely a lot more prep that went into making it go smoothly for class

AI: So the AI gave you a solid foundation, but you had to put in significant work to adapt it for your specific classroom needs.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially when it comes to things like creative lesson planning?

User: i mean, i think AI can help students clarify understanding and provide feedback, but i don't really feel that AI will be able to implement classroom teaching at the moment

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you see AI as a supportive tool rather than something that could replace the actual teaching relationship.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll expand how you use it, or are you pretty comfortable with the current role it plays in your lesson planning?

User: i'm pretty comfortable with its current role.

AI: That makes sense - you've found a good balance that works for you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as another resource alongside your colleagues, and how you balance the convenience of AI with your concerns about student privacy.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: i'm okay. thanks for asking though

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you use AI for creative lesson planning while maintaining those important boundaries around student privacy will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your approach today.
