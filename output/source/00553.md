Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I am good. We can begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Since I work in a tech space where proactive ideas are often encouraged. I use AI mostly for a couple of themes: 

1. To research about innovative ideas that can fit the gap in an end-to-end business process : I provide the AI with a rough draft about what I want to implement and then ask the AI to do analysis on the feasibility and provide a rough draft on the proof of concept.
2. When I am given a task on a new item in which I am an absolute beginner. Recently, I was asked to understand a project which implements Agentic AI's on a client application with the help of AWS Bedrock. I used AI to help me setup AWS Bedrock and provide boilerplate code to test.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI for both strategic exploration and hands-on technical learning. 

Tell me more about that first use case. When you're researching innovative ideas for business process gaps, what does that interaction typically look like? Are you presenting the AI with specific business challenges you've already identified, or is it more exploratory than that?

User: I usually provide the AI with a lot of context after abstracting away any PII or client centric details. For example -

* I will provide the technical services involved
* I will provide in which area the gap is identified or in which area the client is facing a problem
* I will propose a solution myself and ask the AI to proof-read it and provide feasibility analysis or a better solution.

AI: That's a really detailed approach. It sounds like you're doing substantial groundwork yourself before bringing the AI into the process.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Since I don't involve AI in actually building any process and simply ask for suggestions, I don't let it 'do' any of the work. The only area where AI can potentially help in doing the work is with analysis of data from EXCEL or CSV files. However, since it involves client data, I do it completely myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful boundary you've drawn. It sounds like you keep AI strictly in an advisory role rather than having it execute work directly.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: No, I do not delegate any tasks for AI to handle independently. The only area where I use AI's "work" is when I want boilerplate code or I ask it about any processes where I have absolutely no idea. Like with AWS. I did not know how to write code with Python SDK (boto3) and connect to AWS services, I asked AI to provide me with the code and copy pasted it. I also asked it to provide a fully commented code which helped me understand each line.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. So even with the boilerplate code, you're using it as a learning tool rather than just taking the output at face value.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Its quite the opposite actually - no one was using AI or was confused about how to use it without compromising client's data. The way I described earlier actually inspired my colleagues to use in the same way.

AI: So you were actually a pioneer in your workplace for finding ways to use AI safely and effectively. That's really interesting that you became the model for others to follow.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes - I can point out both: 

Satisfied  : 

I was working on a support ticket triaging service in SNOW where our work primary involved reading through a ticket and assign it to the correct group. I asked AI to check the feasibility of using a ML classifier which trains on earlier assignment and then redirects the upcoming tickets by itself. While the AI did provide a detailed feasibility analysis and technical initiation document, it also suggested that SNOW has a framework called 'Predictive Intelligence' under which there is a 'Classification' service which can do the work without relying on external application or program. This really changed my perspective about using AI as they are thorough on knowledge and can provide amazing suggestions. 

Frustrated : 

While trying to set up AWS credentials, the AI kept suggesting that there is something incorrect about the IAM user setup and I need to create the user again. However, after I analyzed it myself, the real reason turned out to be that the credential file had a lot of earlier credentials merged into it which I manually deleted and it worked! So AI sometimes provides generic suggestions in niche areas.

AI: Those are really telling examples. The ServiceNow situation shows AI catching something you might have missed entirely, while the AWS credentials issue shows where your direct troubleshooting was more effective than AI's generic advice.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I truly believe the work we do today will mostly be replaced by AI but it does not imply that we won't have any more work to do but it will just elevate the tables. We will be doing something else where we will be using AI in a similar proportion to which we do today.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - that it's more about evolution than replacement. You see it as the tables being elevated rather than jobs disappearing.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Agentic AI's will mostly take hold of entire pipelines where human teams and researchers will use AI to build better architectures based on evolving human philosophies. Think of it like this - 

During bronze age, if they had something similar to AI, it will equate to human evolution and intelligence grounded on intelligence of bronze age. However, this also means while AI becomes great at doing bronze age 'work', humanity can work towards changing the age from bronze to 'industrial'

AI: That's a powerful analogy - the idea that AI handles the current paradigm while humans focus on paradigm shifts themselves. It suggests a partnership where AI manages today's complexity while humans drive tomorrow's evolution.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits into broader human evolution and your practical approach to maintaining data security while still leveraging AI's capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about pioneering safe AI use in your workplace, the balance between advisory versus execution roles for AI, and your thoughtful perspective on human-AI evolution will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
