Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's do it!

AI: Great! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm an independent musician-entrepreneur. This takes on many forms, such as producing music, recording other artists, mixing music, releasing music, marketing the projects, writing grants to secure funding, and so forth. Think of it like a single-person label.

AI: That sounds incredibly multifaceted - you're wearing so many different hats! It sounds like you're handling everything from the artistic side all the way through to the business operations.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: A majority of the time I use it for admin stuff - like tracking CPC on Meta Advertising campaigns or budgeting to buy new equipment. I've also found myself using quite a bit when writing lengthy applications to government funding, as well as "copy" about releases, such as playlist pitches to Spotify. The content generated in those conversations can usually be used in more than one place (artist statement, for example). On rare occasions, I've tried using LLMs to find the perfect turn of phrase in lyrics - but this isn't usually that helpful and I don't love doing it.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become more of a business partner than a creative collaborator for you. You mentioned trying it for lyrics but not finding it that helpful and not loving the experience.

Tell me more about that. What made the lyric writing experience feel different or less satisfying compared to using AI for those administrative tasks?

User: Well, the first obstacle is that it really isn't that good at it. I've tried a few different models and they always generate generic or non-applicable ideas. It's usually stuff that people would find 'corny' or uninspired. That's why I only really reach for it when I can ask for a really granular task that don't require idea generation or conceptual thinking, like "Find a rhyme for XYZ" or "Write this sentence but only use 4 syllables". For that stuff, it can be really helpful.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing a clear line between AI as a technical tool versus AI trying to generate the actual creative ideas. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot using it for very specific, mechanical tasks in lyrics but keeping the conceptual and emotional core firmly in your own hands.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Well I've used it to write the copy and press content (for music releases) that I submit to DSPs and playlist curators. It seems 'good enough', but I can't help think that it might be hurting my chances because so many people probably have similar pitches. Same goes for grant writing that describes my creative practices.

AI: That's a fascinating tension you're describing - AI is helping you handle those time-consuming tasks more efficiently, but you're aware that everyone else might be using the same shortcuts, potentially making your work blend into a sea of similar-sounding pitches.

When you're working with AI on these applications and pitches, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I usually bring many ideas to the table and have the LLM sort it out into a fluid text. It's rare that the model adds something I really hadn't thought of or whatever. It's moreso like creative presentation of pre-established ideas.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - you're using AI more as a formatting and presentation tool rather than an idea generator. It sounds like you maintain full creative control over the concepts and direction, while AI helps you translate that into polished copy.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The bulk of my creative process remains mostly unscathed - as AI hasn't taken hold of music creation, production, or distribution in a way that feels unavoidable. I've seen people use Models like SUNO, but I don't see myself ever touching those. It's a slippery slope!

AI: You mentioned it being a "slippery slope" with tools like SUNO - that's a strong reaction. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Well, much like with my admin tasks, I think it has the potential to rope people in to a sort of dependence. At first, you're just testing it out, it seems helpful, your brain is combining forces with another intelligence. However, slowly but surely, I find myself (and others) offloading more and more mental labour to whatever tools we use. I think the creative and critical thinking parts of our brains are like muscles, and not using them as much as we might 'need' to is causing a slow atrophy. You know what I mean? That's why I'm really careful about engaging with tools that can quickly take up a majority share of creative decisions. It reminds me of when I used 'Splice' loops for a period of time (pre-recorded loops of music that are royalty-free and made for production) - at first it was a cool addition to my original ideas, but soon enough I was 'writing' songs by simply dragging-and-dropping formulaic ideas until they aligned. Since I stopped that I've had to re-learn how to come up with things on the fly, start from scratch, and trust my artistic intuition, something that's far more rewarding that quick pre-cooked results.

AI: That's such a thoughtful and vivid analogy - the idea of creative muscles atrophying from lack of use, and your experience with Splice loops really illustrates that progression from helpful tool to creative crutch. It sounds like you've lived through that cycle before and recognized the warning signs.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Given your awareness of that slippery slope, how are you thinking about navigating that balance?

User: Well, I don't think it'll be difficult to avoid the services in my personal practice because I have a core aversion to that feeling of creating something yet not feeling connected to it. Imagine how much power that gives to the already rampant imposter syndrome most artists feel! Still, I do have fears about how AI changes in music will affect me externally. As the culture shifts and (probably) accepts AI-made 'art' more and more, I think the market will get (even more) over-saturated with algorithm-pleasing tropes and simplified, cookie-cutter, generic music. so, culturally, i think it will worsen the state of things, where organic authentic art isn't valued because it isn't as profitable as commercial slop.

AI: That's a really profound point about imposter syndrome - the idea that using AI could disconnect you from your own creative output and amplify those existing doubts artists already face about their work's authenticity.

Your concern about market oversaturation with "algorithm-pleasing" content is striking too. It sounds like you're worried not just about your own creative practice, but about the broader cultural ecosystem you're working within.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the "creative muscle atrophy" concept and how you've already navigated that with tools like Splice - that gives you a really valuable framework for thinking about AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: AI in the arts doesn't make sense to me. I've accepted AI will be a core part of society moving forwards, but I don't really see the benefit of involving it in any cultural domain. Why not keep it for the administrative, technical, logistical, things in life?

AI: That's a really clear and compelling perspective - essentially arguing for a division of labor where AI handles the operational side of life but leaves the cultural and expressive domains to humans. It sounds like you see a fundamental mismatch between what AI offers and what art is supposed to accomplish.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that boundary between technical assistance and creative authenticity, and your concerns about the broader cultural implications, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached these questions.

User: My pleasure :)

AI: Thank you so much! It was really wonderful talking with you. Your perspective as someone who's both embraced AI strategically while maintaining clear boundaries around your creative core is exactly the kind of nuanced insight we were hoping to capture. Take care!
