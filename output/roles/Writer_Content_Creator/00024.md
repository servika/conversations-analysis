Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great. Lets go.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I have lots of creative projects, mostly involved with audio and video content creation. My video projects are typically promo videos for the church I work for. They feature service projects or identity statements.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work. When you're creating these promo videos for your church - whether it's showcasing service projects or communicating identity statements - walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI tools for planning and scripting. As most of my videos have time restrictions, I use AI to make sure my plan will fit in the constraint. I also use it to help brainstorm content like b-roll or settings. I also run either my script or outline through AI to clean and tighten it while trying to maintain my voice.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI across different stages - from initial planning through to script refinement. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play in that particular video, and how did that experience feel for you as you were working through it?

User: Sure. I created a promo video for our mobile food pantry that was a shorter version of a previous video. I used AI to talk through the most essential elements to communicate and how to pare down the script for a tight one minute promo.

AI: Tell me more about that process of working with AI to identify those essential elements and pare down the script. How did that conversation with the AI unfold?

User: I gave the voice over from the longer video to the model and asked it to identify what it thought were the most important elements. I then told it what were the important elements for me and asked it to create a one minute script from those details that fit the voice and identity of the church.

AI: When you're working with AI in that way - giving it your longer script, discussing what's important, and having it create that condensed version - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: It's collaborative, but I'm making the final decisions. I find the AI suggestions useful, but often generic and slightly off the mark. So I use the suggestions to shape my own creative output.

AI: That's a really helpful distinction - using AI suggestions to shape rather than replace your creative output. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI tools in your video production process?

User: It makes my work faster and more efficient. It gives me more time to be creative during production and editing.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds significant - freeing up time for the creative aspects you enjoy most. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Like any creative, I'm concerned about AI being able to replicate my work and reduce my value. I have hope that human storytelling continues to be essential to the kind of work I do. Optimistically, I see AI as a partner in my work.

AI: That tension between concern and optimism really comes through clearly. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate it expanding into other areas of your video production, or changing in how you use it?

User: Certainly. I use Adobe products and they are adding AI features regularly. That's only going to continue to grow.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner while maintaining creative control, and how that efficiency gain allows you more time for the truly creative aspects of production and editing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. That's all. Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with creative authenticity, and viewing AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you described your process - from using AI for planning and constraints through to script refinement while maintaining your unique voice. Have a great rest of your day!
