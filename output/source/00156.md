Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a software developer, I use AI to help me write code.

AI: Tell me more about that. What specific aspects of coding do you find AI most helpful with?

User: I use AI to,
1) fix code issues
2) write new code
3) test cases

AI: That's helpful to know the main areas. Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI for one of these tasks? For instance, when you're fixing a code issue, how does that process usually unfold?

User: I would describe the issue and point out the code lines, and ask AI to help. AI would give me suggestions for fixing the issue. I then review the proposed fix and accept if it makes sense.

AI: That sounds like a collaborative process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain coding tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I tend to use AI more for general programming, I prefer to work by myself when dealing data say retrieving data via Rest API.

AI: That's interesting - you draw a distinction between general programming and data retrieval work. What is it about working with REST APIs and data that makes you want to handle that yourself rather than involving AI?

User: The requirements are driven by data, which is often business related. Say what we retrieve from other systems and what we publish. I feel I have better control over the data.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you want that direct control over business-critical data decisions. 

When you do use AI for general programming tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: For existing projects, I collaborate with AI throughout tasks. For new projects, I tend to give AI complete tasks, but I always review AI's work and decide accordingly.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction between existing versus new projects. What drives that difference in how you work with AI - why collaborate more on existing projects but delegate complete tasks on new ones?

User: Existing projects have existing structure, including legacy code, AI may not fit in well and can be less efficient and make thing worse. For new projects, since we are starting from scratch, AI is better positioned to help with architecture, coding with latest technologies and patterns.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the legacy constraints versus clean slate dynamic. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find your team has particular attitudes or approaches toward AI use?

User: We all value AI, and encourage each other to adopt AI more.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently, I decided to use property based testing, I would have to learn property based, I asked AI to write the program, AI definitely increased efficiency and sped up the process.

AI can make mistakes also. When upgrading Java from 11 to 17, the lombok library needed to be upgraded, but AI failed to detect that and decided to update maven plugins.

AI: Those are great examples of both sides. The property-based testing situation sounds like it really accelerated your learning. And the Java upgrade issue shows how AI can miss those specific compatibility nuances.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: In my opinion, AI is good at general programming, I would always try to expand my knowledge into new technologies, so that I have a vision on what should and can be done.

On the other hand, it is important to develop skills in relating technology to business, which is less likely to be taken over by AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - focusing on the vision and business connection aspects. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I will use AI more and more, AI shall be integrated into my daily work. I'll delegate more programming work to AI, and focus more on business, architecture and design.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you differentiate between using AI for new versus existing projects, and your strategic thinking about focusing on business and architectural skills while delegating more programming tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI in software development, the importance of maintaining control over business-critical data decisions, and your strategic approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
