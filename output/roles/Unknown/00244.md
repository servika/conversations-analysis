Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's start

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As an instructor I typically use AI to change the tone of emails I've written. I like to sound warmer and professional

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI as a kind of tone editor for your communications. 

Tell me more about that process. Do you write out your initial email and then ask AI to adjust it, or how does that workflow typically go for you?

User: I usually write out what I want to convey bluntly and then ask the model to reword it so that it's more professional sounding

AI: That sounds like a really practical approach - getting your thoughts down clearly first, then polishing the delivery.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There aren't really any tasks that I do that i think AI could help with. Some of the mundane work, like marking reports, should be completed by me so that i can be familiar with the work of each student.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - maintaining that direct connection with your students' work. It sounds like you see value in personally reviewing their reports to understand where each student is at.

When you use AI for those email tone adjustments, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine the message, or do you tend to give it your draft and use whatever it produces?

User: After I get AI to edit the email, I'll reread it to make sure it sounds good and still conveys what I want. I may make small changes before sending

AI: So you're keeping that final editorial control - making sure the message still feels authentic to you and captures your intent.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find people are generally open about using these tools, or is it something you mostly keep to yourself?

User: Someone in my department has used AI to develop lesson plans, but most other professors are against it and see ai as the enemy. I think they worry about the influence it will have on plagiarism

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - it sounds like there's quite a divide in perspectives within your department. You mentioned concerns about plagiarism being a big worry for your colleagues.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I needed to read a paper and compare them, I fed them both into AI and asked for a summary and comparison. It make it feel really easy to read

AI: That sounds like it really streamlined what could have been a time-consuming task. It's interesting that you found a way to use AI that works well for you, even in an environment where many colleagues are skeptical.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I see AI as a tool, I don't think it will take over these types of jobs, but I do think it will enhance them. Human interaction when learning is so important, but AI will definitely be a prominent presence in education

AI: That's a balanced perspective - seeing AI as an enhancement rather than a replacement, especially given how central human connection is to teaching.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll find new ways to incorporate it, or do you see yourself sticking with the approaches that are working for you now?

User: I may find ways to help me speed up mundane work it I need it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on seeing AI as a tool for enhancement rather than replacement, and how you balance efficiency with maintaining that important human connection with your students.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: not anything that comes to mind

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI selectively - for things like email tone and document comparison - while preserving the human elements that matter most in education will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
