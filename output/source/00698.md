Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No. Let's get started!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: At my job, AI is used to generate orders based on sales and existing inventory as well as generating stocking lists based on the same variables.

AI: That sounds like AI is handling some pretty critical operational functions for you. 

Tell me more about how that works in practice - are you the one directly interacting with these AI systems, or does someone else manage them while you work with the outputs?

User: It depends on the department. For deli and operating supplies, the suggested ordering program generates a suggested order based on par levels and current inventories, but the user can adjust it up or down or delete the item completely. The user can also access all of the available products and order items that did not show on the original list. For retail items, some item levels can be adjusted, but most have that option turned off.

AI: Interesting - so there's quite a bit of variation in how much control you have depending on what you're ordering.

When you're working with the deli and operating supplies where you can make those adjustments, what leads you to override the AI's suggestions? What are you seeing or thinking about that the system might be missing?

User: The system sometimes doesn't understand case counts. For example, instant oatmeal comes  6 units to a case, but the system reads only the individuals. So when one is sold, it sets the order quantity to '1' not realizing that this would actually bring in 6 individual units which is most likely to much. However, I think this has more to do with how the home office has put in the parameters than the ordering program making a mistake.

AI: That's a really clear example of how the system's limitations show up in your daily work. It sounds like you've developed a good sense of when the AI's suggestions make sense versus when you need to step in.

Beyond those technical issues with case counts, are there other situations where you find yourself thinking "I know better than the system here" and making adjustments to what it recommends?

User: Occasionally, we will make adjustments if we know that our sales are going to be different than the existing trend. For example, if there is a football game happening (we are near a college town), we may want to increase some items even though the system does not detect that sales are going to be substantially higher than what it projects. The same goes if we know bad weather is headed our way that may change our traffic flow as well as what people are coming in for.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're bringing in local knowledge and context that the AI system can't see. The football games and weather patterns are things you understand about your specific location and customers.

When you make those kinds of adjustments based on upcoming events or conditions, how do you decide how much to increase the orders? Is it something you've learned through experience, or do you have other ways of figuring out those quantities?

User: It involves looking at reports we can generate that show our high sellers. One report shows us our top 100 items and we can separate it into the different departments. That can be helpful to know what main items we should make sure to have plenty of. We can also look at current sales trend reports to see if overall we are up or down overall a certain percent and add this information in. However, it often comes down to just doing some basic math. For example, we are currently running a promotion on pizza -- buy 2 slices and a 20 oz Pepsi for $8. If last week we saw a 10% increase in the department, we can expect that to continue to go up some as more people become aware and advertising takes effect. If we are going through 3 cases of one slice pizza boxes a week, we may only want to go up one case this week, but be aware of maybe going up two cases next week. We have limited storage space so it is not feasible to just order a bunch of boxes at the beginning of the promotion and than not increase the weekly order.

AI: That's really thoughtful - you're essentially doing your own forecasting by combining multiple data sources and then applying practical constraints like storage space. It sounds like you're doing quite a bit of analysis and strategic thinking on top of what the AI provides.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in this ordering process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I'm old school. I would prefer to do all of my ordering myself because, before technology became so prevalent, I did it all anyway. It is comforting to have that control. However, I do find AI helpful when looking at what is selling at what time of day and how our sales patterns change from weekday to weekend. We try to get our deli to use some of the information to determine what they should stock the case with, especially during times when we have lower staff so need to work more efficiently.

AI: I can hear that tension between valuing your experience and control versus recognizing where the technology can actually be useful. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot with using AI for pattern analysis rather than having it make the final decisions.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Because we are part of a large corporation, it is designed to limit our ability to collaborate and is more likely to handle tasks independently or with collaboration that happens off site at the corporate office. For example, when it generates our restock list, the list is just emailed to us with several other daily sales and labor reports that show the previous day and week performance.

AI: So the AI system is more of a black box that delivers results to you, rather than something you can have an ongoing conversation with or adjust in real time. 

How do you feel about that setup? Does the lack of ability to collaborate directly with the AI system affect how useful it is for your day-to-day work?

User: For me, it does affect its usefulness as well as the perception of how well it performs. When you get a restock list that tells you to put 2 out of something it shows you only have 1 of, you start to wonder who is running the thing. However, I see why it is done that way because it is new enough and ever changing so it is impractical to give a large amount of control to many different people when the company really needs it to perform in a certain way.

AI: That's a great point about the company needing consistency across many locations versus your need for local control. Those moments when the system tells you to stock more than you actually have must be pretty frustrating.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find people have similar attitudes to yours, or do you see different approaches among your coworkers?

User: It differs between my coworkers. Department heads are more likely to have a similar attitude to mine or feel more frustration about the lack of control, depending on what they are seeing. Frontline employees are not bothered by it and just follow the processes we ask them to do.

AI: That difference makes sense - the department heads are seeing the bigger picture and dealing with the consequences when things don't quite work right, while frontline employees are more focused on following the process.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was training someone to be what we call a Retail Sales Specialist--someone who does inventory and invoicing and makes sure the sales floor is stocked and shoppable. She came from a location where she was struggling with having too much inventory of truck chemicals and was feeling a lot of frustration because she didn't thing she had any control over it. We were able to look in the suggested ordering program and investigate her sales and ordering pattern for DEF (a chemical additive used in diesel engines) to see what the system had listed for her build-to level, what her current inventory was, her sales patterns, etc. We were able to see how the numbers worked (the systems build-to minus current inventory equaling what the system wanted to order) and talk about how making sure the inventory was correct was important to ensuring a realistic order and if that didn't work, contacting the home office about getting the build-to (its called an appearance level) changed. Learning that she did have some control of what was coming into her location seemed to eliminate some frustration.

AI: That sounds like a really positive moment - helping her understand how to work with the system rather than feeling powerless against it. It seems like visibility into how the AI was making decisions was key to reducing her frustration.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not too much. I primarily do guest service and people still seem to want that face to face interaction. Some of our locations have self checkout, and we get complaints from some people who do not want to use them and want a human to help them.

AI: That's reassuring that the human element is still so valued by your customers. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think it will change much from how you're using it now?

User: It is hard to say. I see it changing more at the corporate level-- maybe pioneering new markets, campaigns, etc. We might see some fine tuning to help us maximize our product and maybe making each location more individual (stocking what sells there as opposed to every location stocking the same things), as well as improving our efficiency, but we are hopefully years away from robot cashiers and stockers. They may be technologically possible, but most likely the cost is still prohibitive.

AI: Those are all really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the lack of real-time collaboration affects the system's usefulness, and that story about helping your colleague understand she did have some control over the ordering process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I see a huge value in AI in helping to boost creativity--idea generation, etc. However, I also could see it as a crutch that makes it harder for people to use their own imagination or to look at what AI gives them in a critical way. I think it is a danger that some will just accept whatever AI outputs and that companies need to have guardrails and some limitations for its use.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the double-edged nature of AI - the creative potential versus the risk of people becoming too dependent on it without applying critical thinking.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working with AI systems that operate more independently, the importance of local knowledge and control, and the need for guardrails will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
