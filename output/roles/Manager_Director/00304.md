Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Go ahead with your questions.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have a variety of uses for AI. I primarily use the Plus plan of ChatGPT. My use of AI ranges from writing Python, C# and SQL code for designing applications to streamline everyday business applications or larger scale projects. I also use ChatGPT to help me automate certain tasks, such as repetitive Excel work. I have also taken Chat's help to write code for a software application that utilizes machine learning to verify false alarms from our leak detection system.

AI: That's a really diverse range of applications. It sounds like you're using AI across different scales of work - from day-to-day automation all the way up to machine learning projects.

Tell me more about that leak detection project. How did you approach working with ChatGPT on something that technical and specialized?

User: I started using AI to help me brainstorm and create a plan to build the project. Using AI, I did extensive research on different applications as well learning about previous work done in this topic. After scoping out the project, AI also helped me design the pipeline for the model. I used it to explore different methods/libraries as well as improving task flow such as creating scripts to automate the extraction of the training data.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI was involved throughout the entire project lifecycle, from initial research to implementation details.

When you were working through that pipeline design and exploring different methods, were you collaborating back-and-forth with ChatGPT on each decision, or were you more giving it specific tasks to complete and then taking those outputs to work with independently?

User: I am always skeptical of what I get from AI, so I always do my own research and testing before deploying any AI generated code. There was always back and forth discussions and AI helped me debug a lot of issues. However, even the latest version of GPT can hallucinate a lot and so I was always weary of this issue. I could never fully trust the AI to work independently.

AI: That's a really insightful approach - maintaining that healthy skepticism while still leveraging AI's capabilities. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you can't fully trust it to work independently. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself entirely, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Tasks such as creating a presentation for the upper management, I would do almost entirely myself. I would only use AI in that case to brainstorm the content of the presentation, but would create the content myself. Safety sensitive tasks such as performing calculations for designing pipeline systems, would also be done almost entirely on my own. I would run sanity checks on my work process using AI before consulting my supervisor just to iron out any obvious errors in my work. In terms of the machine learning model, I would take code suggestions from the model, run extensive tests, and then implement them.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making between different types of work. It sounds like the stakes and audience really influence how much you rely on AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I was creating the GUI for the machine learning model, I got really frustrated while using AI to help me design the GUI. I was using the streamlit library to create a website which would broadcast the live predictions from the machine learning model. ChatGPT still struggles to understand very specific requirements. However, AI was able to help me really well with creating complex and effective SQL queries for elaborate database structures. It was also able to piece these queries effectively to MSSRS (Microsoft SQL Reports Server) to create useful reports to improve business processes,

AI: That's really interesting - the contrast between struggling with the specific GUI requirements versus excelling at complex SQL work. 

Tell me more about what made the SQL experience so satisfying. Was it the complexity that AI handled well, or something else about how it approached that particular type of problem?

User: The AI understood what I was trying to achieve with a moderate level of prompting. It also helped me debug problems on several occasions that I was unable to find solutions to on the internet. Quickly creating otherwise tedious queries, such as joining thousands of pipeline tag names to their tag IDs and then also grouping them by geographical locations etc, was really helpful.

AI: That SQL success really highlights how AI can excel at those complex, multi-layered data tasks that would be quite tedious to work through manually.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you approach AI similarly, or have you noticed different attitudes?

User: Workplace culture is mixed, the more tech savvy people understand the potential of AI use in the workplace. Whereas, my older colleagues are still skeptical and have a more reserved opinion about the use of AI at work. My use of AI comes from my time in university so I was already well acquainted with the nuances of AI use well before I joined the workforce.

AI: That background from university definitely seems to have given you a head start in understanding those nuances - like knowing when to be skeptical and how to verify AI outputs.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really, I have intermediate experience writing code and I believe that much experience is enough to skillfully maneuver an AI to help my accomplish tasks in that sector. As long as I am writing code, with or without AI, I am still practicing my coding skill.

AI: That's a confident perspective - seeing AI as a tool that still requires your coding foundation to use effectively.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use it, or perhaps using it for different types of tasks?

User: One thing AI could be really useful for is keeping effective notes during meetings. This is a very basic skill that is extremely valued in the corporate world. This obviously has some implications about privacy and ethics but I believe it could be an incredibly useful tool. I will continue to always have this reserved approach to AI as an aid tool and not a complete replacement.

AI: That meeting notes use case is really interesting - and you're right about the privacy considerations that would need to be worked through.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while keeping that healthy skepticism and verification process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all from me. Thanks

AI: Perfect, thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that balance between collaboration and verification, and how you navigate different types of tasks with AI, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
