Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Usually I use AI for one of 2 things: Reading research papers and summarizing contents that i don't quite understand, or writing simple pieces of code, like small functions. Everything else I tend to do on my own.

AI: That's helpful to know. You mentioned research papers and coding as your main uses. 

Tell me more about the research paper work - what happens when you encounter content you don't quite understand? How do you typically interact with AI in those moments?

User: I'll copy and paste the section, usually 2-3 sentences to a paragraph into the AI chatbox, and ask it to resummarize it for me. If that summary still doesn't help me understand, I'll ask targeted questions to figure it out.

AI: That's a clear process. When you're working through those research papers, are there sections or types of content that you prefer to wrestle with on your own first, even if they're challenging?

User: I'll try to figure out the figures first, but on the first pass I'll try to go through and understand things as much as i can, so i'll use AI whenever i need to

AI: That makes sense - you give it your best shot first and then use AI as needed. 

When you're working with AI on these research papers, would you say you're more collaborating with it back and forth through that conversation, or are you getting what you need and then moving on independently?

User: I'm getting what i need and then moving on

AI: Got it. Now thinking about your workplace - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes, my colleagues have asked me to use AI if i'm struggling on a section during a meeting, or asked me to put my own words through AI before i send an email we're working on.

AI: Interesting - so your colleagues are actually encouraging AI use in those moments. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI caught a mistake before I sent an email to an important collaborator which felt very satisfying. AI has also hallucinated citations for an entire paragraph which has made me extremely wary of it

AI: That's a striking contrast - the relief of catching an error versus discovering fabricated citations. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm a PhD student, so as long as you're willing to work with AI, I don't think there's a big problem

AI: That's an interesting perspective as a PhD student. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I'll use it more for research as the capability evolves. I don't believe I'll ever use it for personal messages and creative labor, like figuring out how to redesign my room or something.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your colleagues actively encourage AI use and that clear distinction you draw between research tasks versus personal, creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research comprehension tool, the collaborative encouragement from colleagues, and that important lesson about citation hallucinations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
