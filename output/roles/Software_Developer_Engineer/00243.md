Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, please proceed with the questions you have for me

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Some of the relevant tasks I use AI for are as follows:
* There is piece of code that needs a better format or requires some restructuring/cleaning
* I need a baseline code to start with (a blue print) so I request the AI model to built it using highly specific instructions with low ambiguity. I often have enough experience to create such a code from scratch.
* I often require some quick explanation on a code that implements an algorithm, to identify the logic being used in implementation and to have an idea of where it might break. Again, I often have enough experience to know what the algorithm should be doing.
* I might need to translate an algorithm I implemented in a certain language into another.
* I also use AI models to perform an initial quick research on a science-related topic, an algorithm, state-of-the-art techniques.
* I often use the AI-model to understand already-localized bugs, and try variations of the suggestions it provides, aligned with my specific context.

AI: That's a detailed breakdown - it sounds like you're using AI across several stages of your development process. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that you often have enough experience to create code from scratch or understand algorithms yourself. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The task I prefer to handle myself are often categorized into: 
* Something I am creating for deployment and I need to be fully-aware (or as much as possible) of what each part is doing.
* I am trying to increase my proficiency in a certain language while analyzing an algorithm.
* I validate the summary of the research's results provided by the AI model, so that I can actively learn from the source.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you're strategic about when direct involvement helps you maintain control or build skills.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I often collaborate with the model throughout a task. however, the more I advance into the task more specific the questions I pose become; also, the number of questions decreases over time since I get to ''absorb'' the knoledge provided by the AI model.

AI: That's an interesting progression - starting with broader collaboration and then becoming more targeted as you absorb the knowledge. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They have not influenced me in a significant way; my role and tasks often benefit from the particular way I decide using the AI models.

AI: That's helpful to know - it sounds like you've developed your own approach based on what works for your specific role.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The only possible frustration would be related to situations in which unrequested modifications to a code were made by the AI model, with or without the AI model indicating that they were performed.

AI: That's a concrete example - it sounds like maintaining visibility and control over code changes is really important to you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Maintaining such skills is relevant only/mostly if they are connected to a way of thinking, or if the skills are related to areas that will likely need someone who knows enough to debug specialized/challenging issues.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - focusing on the thinking processes and specialized problem-solving skills that remain uniquely valuable.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It could evolve mostly if they become more capable, so that I can do more of the ''creative'' aspect of it. However, I would keep trying to learn as much as possible from the knowledge the models provide.

AI: That vision of focusing more on the creative aspects while continuing to learn is really interesting.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some thoughtful insights about your strategic approach to using AI - I particularly appreciated how you described that progression from broader collaboration to more targeted questions as you absorb knowledge from the AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining control over code changes, the strategic balance between learning and efficiency, and how your interaction patterns evolve throughout a task will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
