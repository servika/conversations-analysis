Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sound good!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to make my writing better.  I can type a quick reply and get a wonderful response that is well thought out and beautifully written.  I can also paste the email and ask how I should respond to get a certain result.

AI: That sounds like AI is really helping you with your communication. Tell me more about that - when you say you can "get a certain result," what kinds of results are you typically aiming for in your email responses?

User: I like to use AI to make my writing more professional.  It is also helpful when I thing my own response is being to hostile, I can ask AI to make my response friendlier.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you navigate the tone and professionalism of your communications. When you mention that sometimes your own response might be too hostile, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you recognize when you need that help with tone?

User: Sometimes I deal with customers who can be a little on the annoying side.  I like to write my reply to their question, then ask AI to make my response more palatable.

AI: I can see how that would be valuable when dealing with challenging customer interactions. When you have AI help make your response more palatable, do you find yourself learning from those revised responses, or do you mostly just use the AI-generated version and move on to the next task?

User: I just go on to the next task.  I have the ability to write what the AI response.  It is a time saver and lets me concentrate on the more important tasks.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you view AI as handling a task that you could do yourself, but it frees you up for other priorities. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When it comes to something creative, I like to handle it myself.  I may have AI tweak certain things, like enhancing an image, or making something more descriptive, but I want the creativity to come from my own mind.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making between the creative core and the enhancement aspects. When you do have AI help with those tweaks - like enhancing an image or making something more descriptive - how do you typically work with it? Do you go back and forth collaborating throughout the process, or do you hand off specific pieces for it to complete independently?

User: I do go back and forth.  I like to use AI to create images to illustrate my ideas.  I usually have to go through a few iterations to get what I desire.

AI: That iterative process sounds like a real collaboration. When you're going through those iterations to get the image you want, what's driving your decisions about what to adjust or change? How do you communicate to the AI what's not quite right about each version?

User: The content is driving my decisions.  If I do not like a certain aspect of an image, i will prompt the AI with what I want to change.  This usually take a s few tries before it is to my liking.

AI: That back-and-forth refinement process sounds like it requires quite a bit of your attention and input. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your organization encourages AI use, or is it more of a personal choice you've made?

User: My workplace encourages AI, just want to make sure we actually read and approve of the content before it is sent.

AI: That's a good balance - encouraging use while maintaining oversight. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was frustrated when I wanted to use AI to change the font in a PowerPoint project.  I had multiple slides that needed a different style font and a different size font.  the AI said it had completed the prompt.  However the file was not downloadable.  I later found out that there was never any file and the AI was not telling the truth about the answer it gave

AI: That sounds like a really frustrating experience - especially when you're relying on AI to complete a specific task and it gives you the impression it's done something it actually can't do. When situations like that happen, how does it affect your trust or approach to using AI for other tasks? Do you find yourself being more cautious about certain types of requests?

User: I always proof read.  I don't blindly trust AI.  I am always cautious.

AI: That cautious approach makes a lot of sense, especially given experiences like the PowerPoint situation. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I always maintain my skills.  I don't live my life based on what AI may or may not do.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future, or are you pretty content with how you're incorporating it now?

User: I will continue to use AI and I think it will keep getting easier and better.  It gets exponentially better as time goes on.  I can see the difference from month to month.  I believe I will use it for more tasks as days go by.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI as a time-saver while keeping your creative control and always maintaining your own skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I would like to use AI to create video content.  At work, I create customer facing tutorial videos on how to use software.  I would love to have an AI assistant that will help with these tasks.

AI: That's a really interesting application I hadn't thought to ask about. When you envision AI helping with your tutorial videos, what specific aspects of that process would you want it to assist with? Are you thinking about things like scripting, editing, voiceover, or something else entirely?

User: I can use it for scripting and voice.  I would like to use it for the actual video content.

AI: That sounds like it could be a significant shift in how you create those tutorials. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from email communication to creative work, and especially that future vision for video content, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've described your approach - particularly that balance of embracing AI's capabilities while maintaining your own skills and creative control. This has been a great conversation.

User: Thank you!  Bye!

AI: Thank you so much! Have a great day - bye!
