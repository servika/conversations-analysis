Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI to help with drafting up email and letter drafts. I usually use it more for a template and leave out patient identifying information due to privacy reasons, so I use it more so to get a template. Sometimes I also use it to get some exercise ideas.

AI: That's really helpful. It sounds like you're being thoughtful about privacy considerations while still finding practical ways to use AI.

When you're creating these email and letter templates, could you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you go from having the AI create a template to making it work for your specific situation?

User: I can describe it in a specific instance. For example, if I have to write an email to the team to give an update on how a patient is doing in physiotherapy thus far,  I would first tell AI that I need to write a professional sounding email about a patient I've been working with and give an update. I would then write out specific information that I want included, such as the gains they've made, their baseline functional mobility, and the potential discharge date/location. I would ask it to keep the name of the patient as "Mr. BLANK" and state to use the pronouns he/him. I would keep the conversation with AI going until I have a template that I like and then add in the patient identifying information to finalize it.

Sometimes, I may already have a draft of an email/letter made or a template from another colleague. In some cases, I may want to add more to it or may want to improve it, so I would provide the template/draft (with any patient identifying information removed) and specify what edits/additions I would want added in.

AI: That's a really detailed picture of your process - I can see how you've developed a systematic approach that balances efficiency with privacy requirements.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from something like email templating?

User: I could probably use AI to help me with some of my documentation, but I don't think it would save time because the hospital I work at already provides a template that we fill in.

Another instance would be using it to help me keep track of my hours/practice hours, but I also don't think it would save much time as I already made an excel spreadsheet previously. If there were any other things I would need to keep track of, I would probably use AI to help me draft up a template table that I could use instead of making one from scratch.

I often struggle with public speaking and need to attend Rounds and Family Meetings at times, but they are more rare lately since I am now working casual shifts (so I don't have an ongoing caseload and take on shifts when colleagues are on vacation/sick). If I were to need to attend these meetings, I would likely use AI to assist me with writing out a general template to ease some of the anxiety of what to say exactly in the meetings. I would also potentially use it to assist with soft skills needed in the meetings, such as ways to ease anxiety, look more confident, and build rapport in meetings.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're strategic about when AI adds value versus when existing systems already work well for you.

When you mention using AI for those speaking situations like Rounds and Family Meetings, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout preparing for a meeting, or do you tend to give it the full task of creating a template that you then take and use independently?

User: I think I would be more collaborative with it instead of just asking for a template and then using it independently afterwards. This is because there is a high chance that I would want it to reword things or make some edits. I would also want to collaborate more so that it could provide tips on how to improve soft skills and ease anxiety during the meeting.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - especially for something as personal and nuanced as managing anxiety and building confidence in meetings.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: Some colleagues have shaped it a bit as I see some of them are using it to write quick informal emails to the team in order to improve communication, since English is not their first language. It helped me realize that I could use it for more complicated emails/letters that I need to write, since I don't think it would save me much time for more informal emails (as English is my first language). It also shaped my approach from being more hesitant at first to use it to more open to it.

However, the overall workplace culture at the rehab hospital I'm at is that AI is a more taboo item to use and it is often looked down on when someone is very obviously using AI to entirely do a task for them. It did play a role in shaping my approach because I agree that it should not be something that one uses mindlessly in order to avoid doing a work task. Instead, my approach is that it is a tool that I can work with collaboratively in order to improve my work quality and efficiency.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the balance between leveraging AI as a tool versus becoming overly dependent on it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time that AI made me feel particularly satisfied was when I was asked by a physician for an update via email when it was 3:55 pm. I work from 8 AM to 4 PM, so it felt like such a last minute ask that would lead to me having to stay late. In that scenario, I collaborated with AI in the same way that I described in detail about in order to get a template going. I provided all the key details needed in the email while excluding any patient personal information. As a result, it saved me the time that I would usually spend to think about how to word things in a professional manner, especially since that physician specifically is less friendly than other colleagues. Through this great collaboration, I was able to leave only slightly later than 4 PM and did not have to work too much overtime!

AI: That's a great example of how AI can help in those time-crunch situations! It sounds like having that collaborative process really paid off when you needed it most.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't actively considered it, since I still actively use the skills that AI could potentially take over for, such as writing emails in a professional manner. I guess I haven't thought about it too much because I still actively complete these tasks without the use of AI over 80% of the time and it is more of a collaborative process even when I do utilize AI.

AI: That's a balanced approach - maintaining your skills while using AI as a collaborative tool when it makes sense.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: My work is quite hands-on with working with patients, but every encounter that I do have with a patient means a lot of documentation afterwards to ensure that every session is put in the patient's chart. I find this quite time consuming and it often feels like it would be great if some of the time charting could be used seeing more patients instead. This is especially pertinent with the staff shortages in the hospital these days.

With this in mind, I could envision the relationship changing to where we would be actively speaking into our phones/a mic during patient sessions about what is going on, so that at least part of the documentation is immediately completed by AI. For example, if using a SOAP format to document a physiotherapy session, I could state out the findings in S (for subjective findings) and O (for objective findings) during the session and could then just complete the rest of the note after the session. This would save at least half the time. However, I could envision there being instances where we would not want to state these findings in front of the patient (such as something they may be embarrassed or upset hearing), but at least the ones that we are okay with saying out loud could be immediately documented to save time. This would decrease time spent in a session writing down a patient's Manual Muscle Testing results or AROM numbers. This would also decrease the amount of error in documentation (due to error in writing numbers down or error in memory) by having it inputted directly as it is happening.

AI: That's such a compelling vision - using AI to capture real-time documentation while still maintaining the clinical judgment about what's appropriate to verbalize in front of patients. It really shows how you're thinking about AI as a way to enhance patient care rather than just streamline paperwork.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI collaboratively while being mindful of workplace culture and maintaining your own skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all I have in mind

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing collaboration with AI while maintaining professional judgment and respecting workplace culture will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've developed such a thoughtful approach to integrating AI into your healthcare work. Have a great rest of your day!
