Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: How detailed should I aim to make the answers that I give?

AI: Great question! I'd say aim for whatever level of detail feels natural to you. Don't worry about giving perfectly polished responses – I'm much more interested in hearing your genuine thoughts and experiences.

If something comes to mind that feels relevant or interesting to you, go ahead and share it. And if I need more specifics or want to understand something better, I'll ask follow-up questions. So really, just speak as you normally would in a conversation.

The most helpful thing for our research is when people share concrete examples from their actual experiences, but don't feel like you need to have everything perfectly thought out before you start talking.

Ready to dive in?

User: I'm ready, let's begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: There are two artificial intelligence systems available to me at my workspace. One of them is used in the day-to-day function of my job, or is at least available for such - I believe it's called MyLowes Companion. This program is designed to let those of us on the sales floor as questions related to product in order to more easily assist customers and facilitate sales. The other program available is Luci, who is far more seldom used - it is the virtual job assistant whose sole purpose to a fault is to facilitate internal and external applicants in finding positions that may be available to them.

AI: That's really interesting - you have access to two very different AI tools for different purposes. 

Tell me more about MyLowes Companion. How often do you actually find yourself using it during your shifts, and what kinds of questions do you typically ask it?

User: The most common functions I would use Companion for are to attempt to identify an item's sales ID number so that it can be sold without a UPC barcode, or otherwise have more information found about it. Doing so would just have me input a general description of the item in hopes that the AI can accurately recognize it and give me the item number. The other function would be finding inventory in the store - with hundreds of thousands of items in the store and over a thousand bays the stock is distributed through, more often than not such a tool is necessary to track down inventory for those who haven't been in the store for years. Even after six months I don't have anywhere near a catalogue memory that some of my elder contemporaries do. While my Store Manager has been pushing for the Companion to be used more - mostly due to his own Manager pushing *him* to have us use it more as a matter of visible metrics - I don't find myself defaulting to the application all that much, leaving it used at most maybe once or twice a day if that.

AI: So it sounds like while the tool can be helpful for those specific tasks - finding item numbers and locating inventory - you're not reaching for it as your first instinct. 

What do you find yourself doing instead when you need to identify an item or find inventory? What makes you choose those approaches over using Companion?

User: The Products Application on our work phone and the Item Lookup in the register computers allows a similar function when it comes to being able to input a description in line with the item name and finding the resulting item and its item number - with the latter directly inputting it into the cart if the customer is checking out in the moment. Both functions also show the location of the item, with the Products Application being a more familiar and detailed means of listing all locations - both on the sales floor level and in top stock storage - for where the item is intended to be. Both of those methods have generally proven to be faster, with Companion being incredibly slow at the best of times - especially during its first few searches of the day - on top of being prone to crashing. This can be especially frustrating if I am being asked a question by a customer in the moment, as it makes them wait more in front of me while I can do nothing but stare at the device. The Products Application and Item Lookup both also provide more full and detailed item information, with Item Lookup being an easier interface even if it provides less information than Products due to it being a computer application and able to be interacted with using a proper keyboard, rather than just a phone screen as is the case for Products and Companion. Companion lacks much of the information that Products more easily provides, and can't provide information one might want that Products or Lookup don't provide.

AI: It sounds like you've found that the existing tools - Products and Item Lookup - are actually more reliable and efficient for your needs. The speed and reliability issues with Companion seem pretty significant when you're helping customers in real time.

When Companion does work properly, are there situations where it gives you something that those other tools don't? Or is it mostly redundant with what you can already do through the more familiar systems?

User: From my experience it has seemed mostly redundant at the moment. I have tried to use it for product recommendations in the event a customer doesn't know what they are looking for, but it has not shown to be able to provide such things, or even provide assistance in use of an item for a customer or use of another tool or application available to me as cashier. It *only* searches for that limited scope of information as far as I can tell.

AI: So it sounds like you've tested its boundaries and found it's quite narrowly focused - just item lookup, without the broader assistance you might expect from an AI tool.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Checking out customers and sales are the only parts of my job I really wouldn't leave to an AI in terms of things that *can* be left to an AI at some level. Checkout requires a level of detail and visual cue that I don't think AI sufficiently has without being a massive risk of inventory shrink. While an AI could be made to recommend product for sales - even if ours can't give even the most basic recommendations - it lacks the truly persuasive and personable capability a human has, while sales also being the primary competing metric making it so my own competitive nature would be remiss to lose out on the avenue of betterment that is my sales numbers. Obviously an AI can't do anything analog like cash counting and interfacing with the cash drawers, which is a large part of my job now, but having kiosks or the like where customers could inquire about something rather than having to angrily berate a cashier who has no training about a subject could be good, even if it's unlikely our customers would wish for such.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're drawing - keeping the tasks that require human judgment and personal connection while seeing potential value in AI handling more routine inquiries that currently fall to you.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: That isn't really an applicable question in my case, I feel, but I will do my best to answer. When I use Companion, I input the description I have, and it either finds me the information (be it location or item number) I need or it doesn't. If I attempted this to begin with and it still fails to find what I need, I will just look for the information through one of the aforementioned avenues, but I am more often just defaulting to those avenues.

AI: That makes perfect sense - you're right that the collaboration aspect doesn't really apply when the AI tool is designed for such specific, one-off searches.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned earlier that your Store Manager has been pushing for more Companion usage because of metrics pressure from above.

User: Corporate, that is to say the District, Region, and Division levels of organization, are always seeking to innovate, and in attempting those innovations they need to prove the value of the resources sunk into them for better or worse. Whether or not the AI is a good idea, it becomes party to a sunk cost fallacy where they've already put the resources into it, they want us to use it no matter what, so now they're actively tracking and counting how often each store, district, and region uses it rather than the, in my opinion easier, alternatives.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how organizational pressures can drive AI adoption regardless of the tool's actual effectiveness on the ground.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustration has come with my last few attempts to use the Companion system at the very least. More often than not it has frozen or crashed as I attempt to use it to locate an item, leaving a customer standing there for needlessly long as I just go back to the Products application I should've used to begin with, or they just walk off tired of waiting. It's a bit embarrassing really. 

Luci, meanwhile, seems like she should be far more useful than she is. She is on our Human Resources website and one would think she could therefore be used for more functions, such as asking questions about policy that HR may pertain to, but she can't. In fact, she can't even parse such a basic inquiry - if you attempt to ask her a question about HR, she will assume you're trying to apply for a position in HR.

AI: That customer-facing frustration with a tool that crashes sounds genuinely stressful - especially when you know there's a reliable alternative you could have used from the start.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am not someone frustrated by those ideas. Assisted Self-Checkout is more efficient than having a bunch of manned checkout lanes. People will complain that innovation has costs, be upset that jobs are lost. Video killed the radio star, the shine of the light bulb cast a shadow over the candle industry, and the roads are filled with automobiles now, not horse and carriage. People are stubborn enough in modern times that they refuse to accept these changes to some extent, and that provides security in and of itself for the meantime, but in the long run there are inevitably some positions that *will* disappear to such innovations.

AI: That's a really pragmatic perspective on technological change. You seem to view it as part of a natural progression rather than something to resist.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think better tools might come along, or do you see things staying roughly the same?

User: At work, as long as the AI we use can be improved, I'm fine with using it. At work. AIs place is, in my opinion, to be used to make the labours of life easier that the pleasures and luxuries of life can be more enjoyed by the living man. My employer is a nearly 100-billion dollar company, and AI is not a small thing anymore. They've certainly invested more money in continuing to improve their extant AI than my entire store would ever be paid by them. If that investment bares fruit, I'm fine to work with them.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on technological change as part of a natural progression, and your clear-eyed view of how organizational pressures can drive AI adoption even when the tools aren't quite ready for prime time.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Something I wish to share: not work, I suppose, but more in my day to day life elsewise - as I say, I believe AI should be here to make more gentle our labor while staying out of frivolity and what brings us joy. The fact that the current great advent of AI is in the artistic world - both in imagery and in writing - is something I find abhorrent, as it is the opposite of what I feel AI should be. The status quo has AI taking over luxury to make it easier so that we can spend more time on our labors, rather than the other way around.

AI: That's a really powerful distinction you're making - the idea that AI should free us up for the meaningful, creative parts of life rather than replacing them. It sounds like you see a fundamental misalignment in how AI is currently being developed and deployed.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experiences and perspectives with me today. Your insights about the practical realities of AI tools in the workplace, the organizational pressures around adoption, and your broader philosophy about technology's role have been incredibly valuable for our research.

I really appreciate how openly you've shared your thoughts about both the frustrations and the potential you see in these tools. Thank you again for your time and for contributing to our understanding of human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
