Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure, I am a Canadian lawyer.  I use Microsoft Copilot 365 regularly throughout my workday.  I often use Copilot's Research agent to do a deep dive on a legal topic I have not encountered before.  I also use Copilot to assist me in reviewing contracts or drafts I have written and flagging any issues for me as well as general proofreading.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you use Copilot's Research agent for those legal deep dives on unfamiliar topics, how does that process typically unfold for you? 

Walk me through what that looks like from start to finish.

User: Sure, so I do a lot of work with Canadian telecommunications companies.  Often, I will get a question about the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission's regulatory approach to a particular  issue.  If I am not familiar with the topic, or even if I just want to confirm my knowledge, I would input the topic into the Research agent with a prompt starting with "Assume you are Canadian telecommunications lawyer with 20+ years of experience...."  The Researcher usually then asks me a few follow-up questions to confirm its understanding of the question and my desired output, and then I wait a few minutes while it generates a report.  I will then review the report.  Sometimes, I may ask follow-up questions, but often I will proceed directly from the links and citations provided in the report to doing my own research.  As a lawyer, it is important that I verify AI output.  I would never rely on AI without verifying the underlying sources for its claims.

AI: That verification step you mentioned is really interesting. When you're reviewing those reports and checking the underlying sources, what do you typically find? 

Are there patterns in where the AI gets things right versus areas where you need to make corrections or adjustments?

User: The Researcher agents are more accurate than the general "Chat" functions.  I find that Copilot's standard "Chat" function is often wrong about legal topics.  However, the Researcher generally speaking is correct and usually points me to relevant sources.  In the Canadian telecommunications context, for example, it usually link me to the relevant CRTC decisions.  Occassionally, it may miss a very recent decision or make errors of either including decisions not relevant to my question, or failing to include decisions relevant to my question, but overall, I find that Copilot's Researcher agent generally gets me 80% of the way towards answering my question.

AI: That 80% figure is really specific - it sounds like you've developed a good sense of what to expect from it. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain legal tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: In my practice, I find that AI is most helpful with large research questions about telecommunications policy and regulation.  I find that AI is less helpful when drafting short correspondence for example or routine corporate documents, such as annual resolutions.  For these shorter and more routine tasks, I find it takes more time to work with AI because the output is often not in my writing style or fails to adhere to our firm's templates.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like there's a sweet spot where the complexity and scope of the task aligns well with what AI can offer you.

When you do use AI for those larger research questions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the research process, or do you tend to delegate the initial research phase for it to handle independently before you take over?

User: Generally speaking, I will ask it a single research question, which is often very detailed.  For example, there are often 5+ sub-questions for it to research.   Usually, the report the Copilot Research agent generates is so extensive that, after reading the report, I will take over from there by reviewing the underlying sources to deepen my understanding and verifyign the output.  Ocassionally, I wil ask follow-up questions if I think of new avenues of research that build off the initial question or if the AI model missed the mark completely and I need to recalibrate my question to get the desired output.

AI: That's a really clear picture of your workflow. It sounds like you've found a rhythm that works well for you.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been much discussion about AI adoption at your firm?

User: We are a fairly small Canadian law firm with 4 full time lawyers and some support staff.  I was the primary driver behind introducing Copilot 365.  While the whole firm attended some initial training sessions with our IT support firm, generally speaking it seems that I am the only one regularly using AI in my practice.  I know that one colleague uses her personal ChatGPT subscription for legal research, but she is not that adept at using it and does not understand how to use the functionality of our Copilot 365 subscription.

AI: It sounds like you've become something of the AI pioneer at your firm. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure, I recently had to prepare a detailed proposal for a client that was considering retaining our firm in a complicated regulatory matter.  It is the kind of proposal that, in the past, would have taken me several days to a week to prepare given the complexity of the matter an the client's specfiic requirements.  However, because I had some extensive rough notes, I was able to upload my notes directly from [REDACTED] into Copilot's Researcher agent and generate a proposal to the client that was around 80% complete in 10 minutes.  I then took a few hours to complete the remaining 20% of the work to make the proposal ready for presentation to the client.  Overall, I was very satisfied as this allowed us to get a proposal out the door to the client within a single workday instead of a week.

AI: That's a remarkable time savings - from a week down to a single day. That must have felt pretty transformative.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given how much time AI is saving you on research tasks?

User: I am not so much worried about 'maintaining my skills' as a lawyer.  However, the time savings are having an impact on the economics of running a law firm, particularly a small firm.  The standard billing method for decades for Canadian law firms has been the billable hour.  The rise of AI is threatening the billable hour like never before since a task that used to take 10 hours, for example, may now be complete in 2 hours, with a corresponding reduction in billable hours.  Therefore, we are having discussions in the firm about whether it makes sense to bill some items on a fixed fee basis that reflects the value we provide to the client. 

I have not seen that AI is replacing lawyers yet.  While some clients may have tried this in the early days of AI, the issue is that they do not have the legal training to ask the right prompts to the AI models and are unable to assess the accuracy or relevancy of the outputs.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective on the economic implications - you're seeing firsthand how AI is disrupting traditional billing models rather than just individual skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular ways as the technology develops or as your firm adapts further?

User: I think I will continue to further integrate AI into my work.  Right now AI is pretty good at researching and reviewing, but it is still not quite up to par when it comes to legal drafting.  It has difficulty in matching our firm's stylistic conventions for example.  I would hope that as it improves in legal drafting, I will be able to use it to cut down on drafting time and allow me to focus on higher level strategic considerations for clients.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI is disrupting the billable hour model and forcing law firms to think differently about value-based pricing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI is transforming legal practice - from the practical workflow changes to the broader economic implications for law firms - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear from someone who's clearly thought deeply about both the tactical and strategic aspects of AI adoption in their field. Have a great rest of your day!
