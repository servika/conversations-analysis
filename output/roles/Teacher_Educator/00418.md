Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have two different part time jobs where I use AI. One of those jobs is a preschool teacher. I use AI to help plan different activities, such as art projects and sensory bins, and tie them into books that are age-appropriate and meet curriculum goals and standards. AI helps me make lesson plans and charts to plan and monitor progress. I also use AI to rewrite emails to make them sound more professional or I ask for inspiration on writing a difficult email, like where I need to protect privacy (HIPPA) but I need to let the class know a contagious condition has been in the class and others have been exposed. For my real estate job, I primarily use AI to clean up my writing for property descriptions and to make templates for emails.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across two very different professional contexts. 

When you mention using AI for lesson planning and tying activities to curriculum standards, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you and the AI work together on something like that?

User: One general example I that I will tell the AI our topic for the week, in this case we will say the topic is Autumn/Fall. Then I will tell AI that I need ideas for a sensory bin, with materials safe and appropriate for a 24-36 month old, that will help with fine motor skills and sensory play. I will also ask for book recommendations that are age appropriate related to the season of fall. Our curriculum is centered on play based learning so I will also usually ask for game ideas or modifications of an idea I already have.  I also try to touch on ideas of social-emotional learning and gross motor, and will ask for suggestions for games or songs to incorporate.

AI: That sounds like a pretty collaborative process where you're providing the framework and goals, and the AI is helping generate specific ideas within those parameters.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There is a wide range of developmental growth between 2 and 3 and I know what my kids can and cannot do based on attention span and behavior. That is hard to get AI to understand so for somethings, like art or what toys to incorporate, I know best with my kids personalities and abilities.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you have that direct, in-the-moment knowledge of each child that would be impossible for AI to replicate.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I use AI heavily over the weekends to plan the following week. I will tweak or ask for modifications of things I like but they aren't quite right. I don't necessarily make changes to the plans daily, but will sometimes come back after a school day if the plans I had for the day flopped because of behavior, lack of interest, etc.  I don't usually delegate a task to do from start to finish. It is definitely more of a collaboration process.

AI: So it sounds like you're really working together with AI rather than handing things off completely - you're guiding the process and making adjustments based on how things actually play out with the kids.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not too much. I have influenced our school director to consider using AI to help with parent letters, communication, making templates we use regularly, and rewriting difficult emails.

AI: Interesting - so you've actually been more of a pioneer in introducing AI to your workplace rather than following others' lead.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The times I find AI most satisfying is when I know what I am trying to say but I can't get it to come out right. One example I specifically remember is when I asked for brainstorming help to expand on the usual questions I ask to get to know kids at the beginning of the year and I told AI what my goal was--- to really get to know the parent's expectations and fears and that helped me plan the way I communicated and what I focused on to make the parent's feel more comfortable, as well as the kids.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you articulate something you already understood intuitively. It sounds like it helped you turn your professional instincts into actionable communication strategies.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Can you elaborate what you mean?

AI: Sure! I'm wondering about skills like lesson planning, writing professional emails, or creating activities - areas where you currently use AI to help. Do you ever think about whether relying on AI might affect your own abilities in these areas? Or is that something that crosses your mind at all?

User: Not really. I know that these are things I could do on my own, but AI can research and scour the internet to find book ideas, for example, that could take me a long time to find or might not find for sometime since I rely on recommendations from others. I think of AI as a well read friend with an expansive memory.

AI: That's such a nice way to think about it - like having a well-read friend with perfect recall. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as time goes on?

User: The more I understand about perfecting prompts and what AI can do,  I am sure that I will find other ways to use it to my benefit.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a collaborative partner rather than something you delegate complete tasks to, and how you think of it as "a well-read friend with an expansive memory."

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not at this time, but since my knowledge of AI is growing everyday, there could always be questions in the future.

AI: That makes perfect sense - AI is such a rapidly evolving field, and it sounds like you're continuously discovering new ways to integrate it into your work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI collaboratively across two different professional contexts - especially how you balance AI assistance with your own professional judgment about what works best for your specific students - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

We really appreciate you taking the time to speak with us today!

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and thank you again for participating in our research.
