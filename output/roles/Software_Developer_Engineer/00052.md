Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no thanks

AI: I appreciate your response. Just to clarify - are you saying you don't have any questions and we can get started with the interview, or are you not interested in participating in the research interview today?

I want to make sure I understand correctly so we can proceed in whatever way works best for you.

User: sorry I meant i don't have any questions

AI: Perfect, thank you for clarifying! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent project involved researching the Sumoylation of the 26S proteasome in yeast. I was not involved from the very start, but from my end I began by reading around lots of papers in the field (both SUMO and the proteasome itself, and their interactions), then once i had an understanding of the current research i identified the gap and what needed to be studied further. Then I helped design relevant experiments with my team, and adapted and optimised them as needed as we went through the project, and as results appeared. Once we had all results satisfactory, we analysed the data, and prepared the results into clear figures. Then I went back to reading the literature to see how my results fit in in the context of the wider research, and write all of this up, including the methodology of the experiments.

AI: That's a really thorough overview of your research process - from literature review through experimental design, optimization, data analysis, and final write-up. It sounds like quite a comprehensive project.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I only used AI to help slightly with data analysis as i find that harder, and sometimes for formatting of figures / overall paper

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for the data analysis - what specific aspects did you find helpful there?

User: Sometimes to decide what statistical test would be relevant for a particular data set, and then if I am having trouble coding in R or python i will ask for help with that as programming isn't my area of expertise

AI: That's really helpful context. For those specific tasks - deciding on statistical tests and getting help with R or Python coding - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach, like maybe asking a colleague or looking up resources?

User: I usually would ask a colleague first, but in that instance i was working from home, and AI is the quickest and most convenient tool compared to just searching online

AI: That makes sense - convenience and accessibility seem to be key factors for you. We're about a third of the way through our conversation now.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process that you mentioned - like the literature review, experimental design, or writing up your methodology - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I am quite sceptical of using AI for research/ writing as for research, I worry it will miss out something crucial, so i prefer to do it myself. In terms of writing, although i know it can be helpful for formatting or sometimes editing, I like my style of writing and if I use AI I know it's not me. I also think most available AI has a very obvious writing style which I would then have to edit to make it soound like me, which would end up taking more time

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like you have clear reasons for where you draw those lines. The concern about missing crucial research details and wanting to maintain your authentic writing voice makes a lot of sense.

When you have used AI for those statistical tests and coding help, how do you verify or validate what it produces before you use it?

User: for the coding, I basically know if it's working based on if the code runs and produces what I want it too. For the statistics, I will usually check with someone else after just to be sure.

AI: That's a practical approach - using the immediate feedback from whether code runs properly, and then getting that human verification for the statistical recommendations. 

We're about two-thirds through our conversation now. Here's my last main question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I'd say maybe if AI could accurately give me all of the relevant papers - with accurate references - to do with my field, and then recommend any other areas that i should search, that would be helpful

AI: That would be incredibly valuable - having AI that could comprehensively map the literature and suggest research directions you might not have considered. It sounds like the accuracy of references is particularly important to you there.

Those are all my main questions. Looking back at our conversation, your approach seems really thoughtful - you're selective about where you use AI based on convenience and your own expertise gaps, while being quite protective of the areas where your personal judgment and voice matter most, like research synthesis and writing.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I do just think in terms of scientific integrity, AI shouldn't be used for writing and especially not for peer review, as that should be reserved for an expert scientist in the field

AI: That's a really important point about scientific integrity - the idea that peer review especially requires that human expertise and judgment from someone who deeply understands the field. Thank you for raising that.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about being selective with AI use based on convenience and expertise gaps, while maintaining clear boundaries around research integrity and authentic writing, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I really appreciate the time you've taken to share your perspective with us.
