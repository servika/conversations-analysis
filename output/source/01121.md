Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I understand.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a musician, I compose music and mix the audio. I use logic pro x as my DAW and things like native instruments plugins for the instruments. A typical project isn't always the same every time, but usually involves writing music for a game. If there is anything like a game ad/trailer video, then I usually treat that like scoring to picture.

AI: That sounds like really dynamic work, especially with the variety between game music and scoring to picture. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: The 2 ai plugins I use are scaler and orb producer. Unfortunately there are no good ai plugins that I have found for use in the entire creation process, but I've found that these 2 are pretty good for brainstorming. Scaler is for chord progressions, and orb producer generates rough musical ideas that are good for building off of. I don't always use them in every project, but they are helpful for when writers block hits!

AI: That's really interesting - using AI specifically to break through writer's block rather than for the full creation process. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I couldn't come up with a progression I liked myself, so I used scaler. It has presets the user can scale through, but can also suggest chords. Using the suggest feature in the sketch menu, I did end up finding something I liked after using it for a few minutes. I try not to rely on these features all the time so I don't get used to not having to do it myself, but it is nice to have the option when I need it.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - being intentional about not becoming too dependent on it. 

When you're working with AI like Scaler's suggest feature, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I hate to admit it, but the plugin has most of the control when using this. While it's possible to change chords if I want to, the plugin is doing 100% of the work. All I do is hit the button and the chords just show up.

AI: I appreciate your honesty about that - it sounds like you have a really clear-eyed view of the dynamic there.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Because there are no good plugins for the "turn this idea into an actual piece of music" part of the process, not a whole lot has changed. The only real difference is that writers block doesn't last as long since the few generative plugins I have can help with that.

AI: That makes sense - so it's really targeted to that specific challenge rather than transforming your whole workflow.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Obviously, the main concern I have is that one day there will not be any more jobs for people like me. I don't think AI will be able to fully replace humans for creative tasks, but this fact really doesn't matter either way. Companies won't hire people for things like game audio or scoring a tv ad if a cheap ai service can do it at a good enough level.

AI: That's a really nuanced point - the distinction between what AI can actually do versus what companies might choose to use it for based on cost alone.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: The main issue I have with these AI apps, as I mentioned before, is that they are simply useless to me as a composer once I get past the brainstorming stage. Ai music services like udio are fun to mess around with, but aren't really useable for professional use in their current stage. They only allow users to download the audio output, not the raw midi data to use in a DAW or sheet music to hand to musicians. I've also noticed a lot of these services just straight up don't understand musical terms at all in my prompt, even if it's something as simple as "give me an upbeat string quartet in this key at this tempo."

AI: That's really insightful - the gap between generating audio and providing the underlying musical structure that you'd actually need for professional work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps specifically with writer's block without changing your overall workflow, and your realistic view of the industry concerns around cost versus capability.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yeah, there is other stuff I'd like to add. I don't make great use of AI plugins now because they are just good for the brainstorming process. But if there was a plugin that could take a melody or chord progression I've written, and generate the beginnings of a form like a sonata or an example piece to give me an idea of how it would sound when finished, or automatically generate all the melodic alterations, (retrograde, retrograde inversion, etc) I would absolutely buy that plugin. It would really save me a lot of time!

AI: That's fascinating - so you're envisioning AI tools that could handle more of the structural and compositional development work, like taking your core musical ideas and exploring different formal arrangements or transformations of them. It sounds like there's a real opportunity for AI to assist with the more technical, time-intensive parts of composition while still keeping you in control of the creative vision.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about both the current limitations and the potential future applications of AI in music composition will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.
