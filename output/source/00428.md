Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes as we chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will help improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI to research topics and verify information quicker. For example, I may be evaluating articles that were scraped with the intention that they will be fed as training data to an AI model. I would ask AI to compile a list of reputable sources for me to read and verify that the data is correct. Some tasks are simpler where the guidelines dictate that no political figures are to be used for training data. I ask AI to find information about figures who I am unsure whether they are a political figure, and make a judgment from the sources retrieved.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI to help curate data that will train other AI systems. 

When you ask AI to compile those lists of reputable sources or research whether someone is a political figure, how do you typically verify or validate what it gives you back?

User: I search up the political figure online to find any biographical information. Wikipedia is usually a good one, but the more reputable websites which have information about the figure, the more confident that my judgment will be correct. I'm not taking the AI's answer as truth before verifying it myself.

AI: That verification step is really interesting - you're clearly maintaining a careful balance between leveraging AI's speed and your own judgment. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Currently, it would be spreadsheet management and data analysis. For my job, I don't require too advanced data analysis techniques. Tasks would take longer for me to define and feed into an AI model over managing the data myself. Further, I can't be certain that AI will always do the exact task within the spreadsheet that I want correctly every time. Mostly, I prefer to do these tasks myself because in the short term, it's faster to do manually than delegate to AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the overhead of explaining exactly what you want versus just doing it directly. 

When you do use AI for work, like with those research tasks you mentioned earlier, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would say it's more of a collaboration. I ask AI for research and information gathering, I double check the information in the answer independently, and I ask any followup questions if there is a part of the AI response that I'm not understanding or unsure of.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like a thoughtful workflow. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: No, they have not influenced the way I use AI in my work.

AI: Tell me more about that. Are your colleagues using AI in their work as well, or is this something you've adopted more independently?

User: I'm guessing my colleagues probably do something similarly because the collaboration would be useful for gathering a lot of information quickly.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't exactly remember the specific political figure I was trying to look up. But they were not a very big political figure, and they also weren't a political figure who was influential in english speaking countries. So the research results were quite unhelpful as they lead to websites where I could not understand the language, and there wasn't much information about this person to begin with.

AI: That sounds like a challenging situation - hitting those language barriers and sparse information for less prominent figures. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would hope to maintain at least all the fundamentals as knowledge necessary. While I'm sure AI could potentially eventually take over this role, I think there is great doubt with the tasks being completed with 100% accuracy. Given that LLMs are essentially probabilistic, I think having a good grasp of fundamentals would be useful for verifying that the AI is completing tasks correctly.

AI: That probabilistic nature is a really insightful point - using your fundamental knowledge as a quality check. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: In my current role, I don't see the relationship changing too much. In the future, I want to build my own purpose built AI agents that complete the tasks for me, and my role would be to verify that it did everything correctly. If not, then I'd have to manually fix it.

AI: That's a really interesting vision - essentially becoming more of a supervisor or quality controller for your own custom AI agents.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining fundamental knowledge as a way to verify AI outputs, given their probabilistic nature.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all I have. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a research collaborator while maintaining that careful verification process, and your thoughtful approach to preserving fundamental skills as a quality check, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
