Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, no further questions.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Right now my company is expanding its use in AI as a whole. We are training new agents to take on every day tasks instead of hiring more junior production coordinators. We are asking AI to expedite  more tedious tasks - for example, today I had a PDF from a client that had a thumbnail of each shot from an edit, along with notes and other information like timecodes. I wanted AI to export out the thumbnails from the PDF into a csv or similar so that each one was on its own line and attempted this with ChatGPT, Gemini, and a few others to no avail. On top of things like that, we are also using AI for video generation and testing the limits of what it can do cinematically.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're exploring AI across multiple dimensions of your work. You mentioned trying several different AI tools for that PDF task but none of them could handle it. 

Tell me more about that experience - what was it like when the AI tools couldn't deliver what you needed?

User: It's really frustrating to try and generate a simple response. Often you spend more time trying to "train" the model on what your desired outcome is than just doing the task yourself. The benefit in the long term is that once the model is "Trained" it can do those repetitive tasks, but trying to get it to understand what you want from the prompt in the first place is really difficult. I've found that the more you try to give it instructions and guide it in the place you want it to be the further it deviates and it's better to try and refine the original prompt.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the refinement process. It sounds like there's this tension between wanting to guide the AI more specifically but finding that actually backfires.

When you do get an AI tool working the way you want it to, how do you typically use it from that point forward? Do you find yourself collaborating with it step-by-step on tasks, or do you more often hand off complete tasks for it to handle on its own?

User: For now, as we are spending more time training and exploring the capabilities, it's more step by step. However ideally we would get it to the place where you can handle tasks on its own. For example we receive client notes in specific formats that need to be imported into our data base and then distributed. I'd love for the AI agents to target emails that receive it and do this on its own. However I've found it is not fail safe and often misses emails that have the information in it, like if we get 10 emails with the same subject line formatted, it will only pick up 6 of them.

AI: That reliability gap sounds like a significant concern, especially when you're dealing with client communications where missing something could have real consequences.

Are there certain types of tasks where you prefer to keep doing them yourself, even though AI could potentially help? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Exactly the tasks I mentioned above - deliverables to and from the clients, distribution of notes, things like that. A BIG one at my work is scheduling the work which is extremely tedious and everyone hates it - we have expensive line producers to do it and they aren't even all that good. Getting AI to do it better would be a big win, we just can't trust it right now.

AI: That scheduling example is fascinating - you have this task that's both high-value and universally disliked, but the trust factor is holding you back from fully delegating it to AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you're approaching AI in your work? Are people generally excited about these experiments, or is there more hesitation?

User: At my specific workplace people are enthusiastic about exploring AI. In my industry at large there is a big pushback and the workforce seems to be split. There are a lot of older artists in VFX especially that are worried about their jobs and seem to resist it a lot more.

AI: That generational and industry-wide tension sounds really complex to navigate. It's interesting that your specific workplace is more enthusiastic while the broader industry has that split.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, we are using AI for video generation for a large budget, mainstream film right now but we are using it mostly in the dev process. We are testing how much of this beat in the script needs to be shot vs can be done completely in AI. How much can be filmed using just stunt performers or video reference, and AI can adjust the setting, lighting, costumes, etc. How much of the facial perfomances are retained? If we cast a certain actor, can AI replicate their expressions? And beyond that, how much can the director art direct the framing, composition, etc.  ? Typically in VFX we get multiple rounds of notes on the same shots (like if you shoot an arrow and it needs to arc in a specific way, AI can find it hard to give the detailed iterations of notes). Also what about the fidelity of image, will there be artifacting, will it hold up in the DI process? Things like that. But the experiments we have been testing so far are very positive and exciting. Everyone is thrilled about the iteration turnaround time and being able to address notes so quickly.

AI: That sounds like incredibly cutting-edge work - you're essentially pioneering how AI might transform film production. The excitement about iteration speed really comes through.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you're doing these experiments?

User: I don't think about maintaining my skills, I think about expanding them into new ones. I worry about how people will be replaced. For example we don't need storyboard or concept artists anymore, but we will need people with a cinematic eye who can art direct the AI generator. That's not really as easy as it seems. I worry that if we don't need coordinators anymore, how we will ever get a producer? There's no entry level position to train upwards. It will become all nepotism.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern about the career pipeline - the idea that eliminating entry-level positions could fundamentally change how people develop expertise and advance in the industry.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I definitely see it evolving but it's changing so fast it's hard to say what the future will hold.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the career pipeline concerns and how eliminating entry-level positions could impact the industry's future talent development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I'm not sure exactly what you are after but I'm happy to discuss more if you'd like to set up another meeting.

AI: Thank you so much for that offer - I really appreciate your openness to continue the conversation. You've already provided incredibly valuable insights about the practical challenges of AI implementation, the trust and reliability issues, and especially those broader industry implications around career development that I don't think we hear discussed enough.

Your experiences are exactly the kind of real-world perspectives that help us understand how AI is actually being integrated into professional workflows, beyond just the technical capabilities.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
