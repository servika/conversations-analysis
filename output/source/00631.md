Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions - let's get going.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a software engineer at a frontier company so we're constantly encouraged to use AI and share the best uses we've found for it. This is fast-evolving so how we're fitting AI into our workflows every day changes constantly. For me, I use AI through Github Copilot daily to code up quick but trivial changes or prototype ideas. I also use more generalized AI to search for resources within my company. Sometimes I use it to explain difficult concepts in programming or technology generally.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're in an environment where AI experimentation is actively encouraged. When you mention using AI to "search for resources within your company," can you tell me more about that? What kinds of resources are you typically looking for?

User: I'll use CoPilot to search through our intranet. I've found it's very good at finding documents like specs and presentations. It can also find some internal company resources. I find a simple prompt like "find me the spec for X feature Y" works better than using other search tools.

AI: That's fascinating that you've found AI search more effective than traditional search tools for internal resources. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I still do most writing of emails and teams messages myself. I feel that AI is capable of doing this, but feels inauthentic. I personally have a specific level of detail and specific verbiage that I like my messages to have.

AI:

User: I still do most writing of emails and teams messages myself. I feel that AI is capable of doing this, but feels inauthentic. I personally have a specific level of detail and specific verbiage that I like my messages to have.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining your authentic voice in communications. It sounds like there's something important about personal expression in those messages.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more collaborative. I'll put Github Copilot on Agent mode, give it plenty of context and detail, watch its initial efforts and understanding, and work with it to iterate. I usually give tasks in small chunks at a time because I find that creates a better result than giving it the entire task at once and creates openings for feedback.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - breaking things down into smaller chunks and creating those feedback loops. It sounds like you've developed a specific workflow for getting better results.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Sure, plenty of folks have been hacking together their own AI tools, providing suggestions for the best way to use the tooling, and building AI into internal processes. I've discovered most of my own processes myself, however.

AI: It's interesting that you've mostly developed your own processes despite being in such a collaborative environment around AI. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I get frustrated when working with a GHCP agent in a longer session and it starts disregarding previous instructions. For instance I would tell the agent to not Build Solution (Visual Studio) to validate its changes because typically I only validate against individual project components rather than wasting time building unnecessary code. After a few turns, it starts to disregard this and starts building the entire codebase to validate its changes.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you've given clear instructions about your preferred workflow and it starts ignoring them. It's like having to repeatedly correct the same mistake.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI has accelerated my rate of learning because it's so good at generating samples and documentations and explaining difficult concepts, so I'm not particularly worried. I feel I'm learning more than ever before.

AI: That's a really positive perspective - using AI as a learning accelerator rather than seeing it as a replacement threat. It sounds like it's actually expanding your capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect it to get involved in more and more complicated processes at work. I expect to generate more complex code with AI and have it become a part of more workflows. I'm still being cautious, however, to not jump too quickly to trusting AI integration into new procedures.

AI: That balance you mention - embracing more complex uses while staying cautious about trusting new integrations - seems really wise, especially in a fast-moving environment.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning accelerator and your collaborative approach with the chunked feedback loops.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really - I think my main thoughts were already covered. Anything else would be minor thoughts and details.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative workflow you've developed, the balance between acceleration and caution, and how AI is enhancing rather than replacing your learning have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
