Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to help me construct social media posts, send emails, provide advice on next steps to grow my business and be more present and easily found on the internet and social media. I also use it to help me write descriptions and I do a lot of research with it regarding laws and even work on reading contracts so that I make sure I'm not missing something.

AI: That's quite a range of tasks you're using AI for. When you mention doing research on laws and reviewing contracts to make sure you're not missing something, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: For contracts: I sometimes upload contracts that I've read through but there may be sections that seem strange or I want to double-check what I'm understanding. Sometimes I'll have AI read the whole thing and make sure there isn't anything unusual or that should be removed. I always provide whether we are on the buying or selling side of the contract so I can protect my buyer or seller. I started doing this when people in my brokerage admitted they hadn't looked at contracts carefully or missed something and their clients ended up owing additional taxes for the next year (not living there) because there were weird stipulations in a couple of brokerages' contracts. For research on laws: There are a wide range of things I use for this. For example, there are a ton of really particular laws on how you can market yourself and the branding that needs to accompany it. It even sometimes mentions font and sizing. Those aren't always things I remember off the top of my head but I don't want to create an ad only for it to have to be redone. So asking for clarification is helpful. Other times the law aspect is more about what rights a buyer or seller has. I've had clients that have Power of Attorney and I need to make sure I'm handling that situation correctly and also filling out the paperwork to adequately reflect that situation.

AI: That's really detailed - it sounds like you're using AI as a safety net to catch things that could have serious consequences for your clients. When you upload a contract and ask AI to review it, how do you decide what level of trust to place in its analysis versus your own judgment or other sources?

User: Almost always (or maybe always to be more accurate), I've already read carefully through the contract and noted things that seem strange or that I want to respond to or strike out. I use AI to see if it also flags the same areas. If it seems like something that could have pretty significant implications, I will then run it by my broker on how to handle it. However, too often I just need a sounding board and to know that I'm reading the contract in the same way.

AI: That makes sense - you're using AI as confirmation rather than as your primary decision maker. When you mentioned earlier that you use AI for advice on growing your business and being more present online, how does that interaction typically unfold? What kind of guidance are you looking for?

User: I've already provided AI with my personality traits and that I don't like fluff and I'm a pretty straightforward person. However, I've also made AI aware that I don't love social media or promoting myself. I use it to help keep me motivated and honest that I'm doing the things I need to in order to gain more traction with my business. Additionally, I'll ask for advice on the next steps I need to take and also have provided information on what has been accomplished so far. Often, I will receive what I need to do next in order to have the most impact...where to focus my time/energy. I've also received help on how to construct my Google business page because for some reason there were multiple businesses established and I had to undo and redo things which I was struggling with solo. I also received the advice that collecting reviews on Google would be more significant than other avenues since I didn't want clients having to go to a ton of different sites and fill out reviews. There are a lot of details like this that help me know where to focus because otherwise I can go down rabbit holes that aren't helpful and just waste time.

AI: It sounds like you've created quite a personalized working relationship with AI - you've essentially trained it to understand your personality and business context. When you get advice about where to focus your time and energy, how do you evaluate whether that guidance aligns with what you think is right for your business?

User: That's a good question--unlike the contracts, I trust AI a bit more without double and triple checking everything (less to lose if a make a misstep in this area). We've also had detailed discussions about my frustration with putting everything on social media and so we've devised more personal solutions that fit my personality (writing notes, sending emails, etc.). I'm still in the midst of figuring this out and honestly it would be nice to have AI as a daily check-in without me always needing to initiate contact. For example, someone that reaches out and calls me on the carpet to see if I accomplished my goal we set out for the week. However, it's also helping me construct social media that fits my personality without posting every aspect of my life.

AI: That's fascinating - you're describing something that sounds almost like an AI accountability partner. When you mention it would be nice to have AI reach out for daily check-ins rather than you always initiating, what would that ideal interaction look like for you?

User: I think, for me, it would make the most sense to have an initial conversation in the morning and go over all I have to accomplish. Allow AI to work within the time I have for the day and discuss what I have to do for my business as well. Then it would make sense to have it check in at the end of the day and ask me what I actually got done with prodding to finish the rest if there's some time left (social media is easily done at the end of the day).

AI: That paints a clear picture of wanting AI to be more proactive in your workflow. When you think about that level of regular interaction - having AI involved in your daily planning and accountability - how do you feel about that kind of relationship developing between you and an AI tool?

User: There's a part of me that would like to have a brokerage that is in closer proximity so that I can run these things past those i've established relationships with; however, that's not practical at this moment because of needing to work through other aspects of my business before making a jump someplace else. It's also something I've been in discussions with with AI (moving brokerages). Even if I switch to someplace closer, I'm not someone who wants to be in an office 5-7 days a week but I do run my business 7 days a week so having those daily check-ins would be helpful for me. I left a very structured environment (teaching high school) to an environment where my day is left largely for me to handle. I've realized I need someone to help me with the structure a bit...I'm very used to not having a lot of decision-making in that regard.

AI: It sounds like AI is filling a gap between the highly structured environment you came from in teaching and the complete autonomy you have now in real estate. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There are plenty of times that I've been pleased with the information I've received. I really appreciate being able to have a 2nd set of "eyes" to read through finer points of documentation. Likewise, being able to check-in with AI and get feedback on what I've done well and what I've missed has been incredibly helpful. That being said, I've had to talk with AI about being too much of a cheerleader sometimes because that can get frustrating to me. I know when I've slacked off and I need someone to kick me in the pants and not tell me that I'm fabulous. There are also times when AI doesn't understand more basic information or misunderstands something that I deem as relatively simple and that gets frustrating when I have to keep going back and showing that the info isn't correct or relevant. For example, yesterday my husband needed help with work and I used AI to find the information we needed. AI responded with docs from 2016. I was on a cell and if I hadn't looked more carefully and pulled up the actual links, we would have been working off of bad info.

AI: That's a really telling example about the outdated information - and it sounds like you've had to actively manage AI's tone to match your communication style better. When you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over, is this something you actively consider in your work?

User: Yes...not for reading contracts, etc. However, I spend hours sometimes constructing listing descriptions or social media posts because I'm so particular about how things are written/sound/vibe and it has saved me a TON of time to provide the basics and have AI do the heavy lifting. I can then have conversations on how I want things changed and tweak it until it's where I want it. I have no problem turning that kind of work over and not having it consume me when I can focus my time and energy elsewhere.

AI: That distinction is interesting - you're very deliberate about where you're willing to let AI take over versus where you want to maintain control. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Ideally it would work more as a proactive assistant that can take over some of the aspects I dread or take too much time while I handle more of the personalized and more serious parts of the business (showings, building relationships via community outreach, discussing contract stipulations, etc.)

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've essentially trained AI to understand your personality and work style, and how you use it strategically for specific tasks while maintaining control over the high-stakes areas like contracts.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Hmmm...I guess there are a few more specifics that could be helpful as I review my previous AI work convos. I probably didn't convey how much research I use it for as well. I like to be very certain of information and sometimes I need a starting point. For example, I'll ask about cost of septic or well for a certain commercial use, or where water lines are within an area. I'll see a code on the auditor's page and have AI give me feedback on the possibilities for the code given the county, etc. Sometimes I'll ask about easement information (usually I have to do that manually though) or zoning for commercial or manufactured homes. There are plenty of instances where I ask it to research what other successful realtors are doing. What would take me hours to do can be done in a fraction of the time and when there are links to double-check info, that is a huge win for me.

AI: That's really valuable additional context - it sounds like AI has become a crucial research tool that dramatically speeds up your information gathering process. The way you describe using it to get starting points and then verify with additional sources shows a really sophisticated approach to leveraging AI while maintaining accuracy.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've developed this working relationship with AI - from the personality training to the strategic task delegation - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! I really appreciate you taking the time to share such detailed insights about your work with AI. Have a great rest of your day!
