Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I sell clothing online, whether that be thrifted or handmade. The handmade pieces are either knit or crochet—the most popular are sweaters and hats. Handmade projects take quite some time to complete and are often quite complex, but I'm always up for a challenge.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting mix of work! I can imagine the handmade pieces especially require a lot of skill and patience.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: When starting a project, sometimes I need help estimating how much yarn I'll need. I'll send information regarding the size of needles/hooks I plan to use, the weight of the yarn, what size I want the piece to be, and it will give me a close estimate. I also use AI if I get confused with the pattern and need some expertise on it. Additionally, I occasionally use AI to help me word messages to buyers regarding items they're interested in.

AI: That's really helpful to understand where AI comes into play for you. It sounds like you're using it for some pretty practical problem-solving.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I'm currently knitting a sweater, and I needed some advice on how large I should make the arms if I want it to fit slightly oversized on a size medium. I gave information on the weight of the yarn, the size of the needles, and how many stitches I used for the front panel, and it gave me a helpful suggestion.

AI: Tell me more about that experience with getting advice on the arm sizing. How did you feel about the suggestion AI gave you, and how confident were you in following it?

User: I've used AI in the past to help with precise knitting questions, and it often gives more general answers to avoid wrongful suggestions, so I was a little reluctant. However, I tried out casting on a number of stitches at the higher end of the range it suggested and the result so far seems to be working well.

AI: That's really interesting that you've noticed AI tends to give more general answers for knitting questions. When you're working with AI in these situations, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I often tell the AI what I'm aiming for, such as cable knit patterns or 1x1 ribbing, and it'll take that into consideration when answering my questions, often incorporating tips throughout the conversation that tie back to previous creative information I've provided.

AI: What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think I'm a bit more confident in my skills now. I taught myself how to knit and crochet, so having AI to answer precise questions is like having a teacher on hand to help me navigate it all. Since I'm more confident, I've found myself leaning towards more complex pieces. For example, I used to only make hats and simple tank tops, and now I can make granny square bucket hats and fisherman sweaters to sell!

AI: That's wonderful that AI has helped boost your confidence to tackle those more complex projects! The progression from simple tank tops to fisherman sweaters sounds like quite a leap.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Not many, to be honest! In fact, I can't even think of one. It's different than if I had a job in accounting or something, you know?

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - that it feels different from other fields like accounting. Tell me more about that. What makes your creative work feel different in terms of AI's impact?

User: Well, it's not like inputting numbers all day into spreadsheets and all that, it's a handmade piece of clothing with intricate detail.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see AI becoming more specialized in certain fields. It may have more expertise to offer in marketing items for sale on my storefront, including detailing various strategies and plans, and it may have more advanced knowledge that can help in creating my handmade pieces that may lead to more certainty and preciseness in its answers.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has boosted your confidence to take on more complex projects - that progression from simple pieces to fisherman sweaters really illustrates how AI can serve as that "teacher on hand" you mentioned.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's it, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. It's been really fascinating to hear how you've used AI as a learning tool to build confidence and tackle increasingly complex projects. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
