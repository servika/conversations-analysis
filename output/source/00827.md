Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.  I'm ready to start the interview.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I started out simply using AI to quickly answer questions for me, but as I've become more familiar with the tool and more confident in the results, I've been expanding how I use AI.  On a typical day, I will use AI to help research information, brainstorm, review and summarize information - highlighting key takeaways, help organize thoughts, get feedback on different approaches I'm considering, and refining draft emails.  More recently, I've been using AI to help organize report structures and merge different draft sections I've written into a better organized and flowing content.  I've also been using it to help write excel code and debug issues I encounter when I don't get the expected result.  And finally, very recently, I've been using AI to help draft code for repetitive data analysis tasks and document replicable workflow pipelines that I can give to newer staff so I don't have to sit with them to give them step-by-step instructions.

AI: That's a really interesting evolution from simple Q&A to more complex collaborative work. You mentioned becoming "more confident in the results" - that sounds like it was a key factor in expanding your usage.

Tell me more about that confidence-building process. What made you feel comfortable enough to move from basic questions to having AI help with things like report organization and code writing?

User: The first obstacle was me getting more used to what an AI platform can do.  Without much experience, I started off asking pretty benign questions like "What actor starred in [insert movie]?" or "What are some good tomato butter recipes?"  The quickness and ease in which I would receive information and uncover information about things I was interested in spurred my curiosity.  This curiosity and becoming more comfortable with the basic research function motivated me to ask more creative questions, like brainstorming ideas or getting social media campaigns for a work product.  In the beginning, some responses were vague or inaccurate; hallucinations were commonplace.  This caused some reservation in using AI tools for serious matters.  But as technology has improved over the past couple of years, and more people use AI, this has resulted in improved training for the models.  I find that when I check the accuracy of responses, there are less likely to have bad information.  I also find the writing to have improved, either because I've learned to write my prompt instructions better and/or the tools have learned more styles.  My increased comfort and models producing more consistently accurate information, along with better quality responses have all led to me wanting to try out more advanced things with AI tools.

AI: That progression from simple factual questions to creative brainstorming makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you developed your own internal testing process along the way - checking accuracy and noticing improvements in both the technology and your own prompting skills.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned all these different ways you use it now, but are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: No, not really.  I've found that using AI is enhancing my work, whether it's reducing the time I have to research, document, or train, or when it returns ideas or information I wasn't previously aware of, which makes me want to learn more and push it and myself more.  AI has freed up time I used to spend on mundane, repetitive, or mentally draining tasks which I can now use to find better ways to approach my work in general.  For these reasons, there's not really anything that I wouldn't at least try and let AI help with.  Even when I'm fact-checking information from AI, I will sometimes use AI to help my narrow down information so I can concentrate on nuanced differences.

AI: That's fascinating - you're describing AI as fundamentally freeing rather than replacing aspects of your work. You mentioned using it even for fact-checking AI itself, which is an interesting approach.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I haven't considered delegating complete tasks to AI yet, but that sounds very intriguing.  Typically, I'm using AI collaboratively - having it help me come up with ideas or approaches, researching, and then reviewing thoughts I have, or text that I've written.  I don't every blindly accept something AI tells me or writes for me,  because maintaining my voice is important.  In fact, my AI tools seem to be learning my writing style and I find I have to correct or refine it less and less.  And at the same time, it's elevating my own writing style and voice by helping me identify how to say things more concisely, in a better flowing way, or simply in better word choice.  In terms of analysis, AI tools have significantly broadened my knowledge and confidence in spreadsheet analysis and basic coding.  I never even knew PowerQuery was a thing in Excel before AI told me about it.  And I'm learning to understand how to read/write python code for repetitive data analysis tasks.  Some tasks that would have taken me days to complete are now done in hours.

AI: That collaborative dynamic you're describing is really interesting - it sounds like you're maintaining your own voice and judgment while letting AI enhance your capabilities. The fact that your AI tools seem to be learning your writing style suggests a pretty deep level of ongoing interaction.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or are you finding your own path?

User: I had some leadership that was similarly intrigued by the possibility of AI enhancing our work, and others that were leery of AI.  Luckily, my supervisor is one of the former and not the latter, and I was one of the first to be able to integrate AI in my daily workflows (I previously established myself as someone eager to use advanced tools and approaches to enhance work productivity).  There was a time when some coworkers wanted to put up a lot of speedbumps and barriers in integrating AI in our work place, but I was articulate about the benefits while at the same time, reassuring management that staff should be trusted to use AI responsibly.  With the latter point, I'm also an advocate for being careful who gets the green-light to use AI.  I think it's important for staff, especially new professionals, to first develop good research skills and work ethic so they don't prematurely become too reliant on AI at the cost of them learning how to discern if information or outputs are valid or accurate.  I strongly believe that AI is a tool not a replacement for good work, and that if used properly it can elevate work as it has in my case.  But I'm not naive to think that it can't be abused or used incorrectly, becoming a detriment as much as it can be a benefit.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on responsible AI integration. You've positioned yourself as both an advocate and a voice of caution - supporting AI use while emphasizing the importance of foundational skills first.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently felt particularly satisfied with I used AI collaboratively to set up code to extract information from 1200 different model outputs.  Each of these files were in a proprietary format that needed to be converted to either CSV or XLSX for analytical purposes.  This task alone would have required hours of mundane conversion, which AI helped automate.  The data extraction process was another mundane repetitive task that AI helped me draft a code to do quickly and efficiently.  Even when the outputs were produced without an error indicator, I noticed that the results weren't reasonable (this highlights my point that new professionals need the skills to ascertain valid responses, not just 'no error' responses).  Using AI, I was able to brainstorm back and forth what could be possible reasons for the unreasonable results, and to come up with a different approach to get better, usable outputs.  Even though it took longer than I anticipated to complete the task, it was still quicker and more satisfying than if I did the task without AI.  I also learned new skills and terminology along the way.  In terms of frustration, when a chat gets bogged down with a lot of data sharing or back and forth, the long response times are irritating, especially when AI sometimes contradicts itself and you have to waste time reminding it of already established parameters/information.

AI: That example really illustrates the collaborative process you described earlier - AI helping with automation while you applied critical judgment to recognize the unreasonable results. The learning aspect seems particularly valuable to you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not personally worried about AI taking over things that I do or skills I'm good at, since AI has helped expand my skill set.  Again, I see AI as elevating me, not replacing me.  That said, I am aware that there are many who fear that AI will replace jobs.  This is a valid concern and I'm sure  some jobs will completely go away, but then new jobs will be created because of AI.  It won't be the first time in history when a new technology has eliminated certain jobs in the workforce.  Because of new technology, women weren't confined to the home and were able to enter the workforce in droves in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.  Having diverse perspectives in the workforce has improved work/information, not hindered it.

AI: That's an interesting historical perspective - connecting AI's impact to other technological shifts that ultimately expanded opportunities rather than just eliminating them.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading as both you and the technology continue to develop?

User: I'm excited to evolve myself with AI, and for AI platforms to evolve.  There are several instances where AI still lacks (in my opinion), like in graphical outputs and data storytelling.  There have been improvements recently, but I'm very excited for the day where one can quickly get a customized image quickly, without weird quirks or artifacts.  Or have AI produce short public-facing animations to help better communicate complex topics.  This latter idea is something I would love to do more of, but am limited myself talent wise.  Having an AI to help bring the ideas I have in my head to fruition would be amazing.

AI: Those are exciting possibilities - using AI to bridge the gap between having creative ideas and being able to execute them visually. It sounds like you're thinking about AI as potentially unlocking entirely new ways to communicate your work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on responsible implementation - how you've advocated for AI use while emphasizing the importance of developing foundational skills first.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.  This has been a thoughtful interview and has motivated me to push my experience with AI tools even more.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution from simple Q&A to complex collaboration, the importance of building confidence through testing, and your thoughtful approach to responsible AI integration will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you enjoy exploring those new possibilities with AI tools, especially in the visual and communication areas you mentioned. Thanks again!
