Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do quite a lot of creative work with AI. I do many crafting projects, design social media posts, peruse AI for inspiration for crochet projects and patterns, come up with fun ideas to boost morale at my place of work, etc. Recently, I used AI to design a bubble gum machine logo for my office. It gives out adult prizes. AI helped me come up with a vinyl design that reads: [REDACTED]'s Subpar Prize Machine: Lower your expectations and turn the knob. It has a melty smiley face on it. The staff members love it! I also have used AI recently to come up with many social media posts and inspiration for the dental office I work at.

AI: That sounds like such a fun and diverse range of creative projects! I love the humor in that bubble gum machine logo - "Lower your expectations and turn the knob" is brilliant.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I ultimately begin with AI to expand on an idea that I have. Let's talk about the bubble gum machine to start. I first saw an old bubble gum machine for sale and thought it would be awesome for staff members to be able to earn tokens to get a spin. When I got my initial idea, I then turned to AI to first get recommendations on fun trinkets to put in that were fun and adult humor. Then I asked it to generate some fun names to call it based on some factors: my office is in the basement, it hands out subpar gifts, it is my own personal machine and not sanctioned by the doctors, etc. After inputting my initial ideas, I was able to conversate back and forth until I settled on the perfect name. After settling on a name, I continued to consult it to come up with a fun slogan so staff members would know not to expect anything super great from the machine, as it is truly just a fun little game to boost morale. After I decided on a fun slogan, I was able to consult it to come up with a design for a vinyl cut out to put on the front of the machine.

AI: That's such a detailed process - I can really see how you use AI as a creative partner throughout each stage! It sounds like you start with your own spark of an idea and then use AI to help you develop and refine it step by step.

Can you describe what that back-and-forth conversation with AI felt like as you were working through the bubble gum machine project? How did you know when you'd landed on "the perfect name"?

User: I initially stated what I was doing with the project and gave the details I mentioned to you earlier. AI then gave some suggestions and I went back and forth multiple times, over multiple days even, to finally come up with a name I thought was perfect. AI suggested many names to begin with and I would prompt back stating to focus more on one thought process (ex: add more suggestions that have to do with my office being in the basement, give me more suggestions that get the point across that these prizes are basically worthless, give me a suggestion that uses my name, make it shorter because it needs to fit on a 5" x 17" glass front and I want the words readable, etc.). After spending quite a few turns (probably 10 over a few days), the model suggested a name I thought embodied the project very well--[REDACTED]'s Subpar Prize Machine. I then wanted to add a little subtext so went back to the model to gain ideas for wording. Again, I needed it to be a short length so it would fit well on the space I needed. After the same back and forth process I mentioned above, I settled on Lower your expectations and turn the knob. I run the ideas by a few friends and they all agreed it was a great name.

AI: That's fascinating - so it wasn't just one quick exchange, but really an iterative creative dialogue over several days. It sounds like you were very much steering the direction, giving AI specific constraints and feedback to guide it toward what you were envisioning.

When you're working with AI in this back-and-forth way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Honestly, I have been reluctant to use AI much because I'm afraid of neglecting my own brain of the exercise it gets by brainstorming, writing, editing, etc. So, I always like to make sure I am giving the initial idea and use AI to hone that. I would hate to live in a world where humans don't have original ideas and everything is just AI generated. This is kind of a guardrail I have set for myself. I usually get my ideas from different types of media (mostly things I see on socials) and then try to expand that so it has a spin that is all my own. At that point, I will sometimes take it to AI to expand on that. It is rare that I use AI to come up with an original idea before first brainstorming the situation on my own. It makes me feel like a bit of a failure if I can't come up with my own thoughts to get started. It's a fine line between using my resources (AI) and still using my own brain so it doesn't waste away.

AI: That's such a thoughtful perspective - you've clearly given a lot of consideration to maintaining that balance. It sounds like you see AI as a powerful resource but want to make sure you're still exercising your own creative muscles and maintaining ownership over the initial spark.

Tell me more about that feeling you mentioned - the concern about your brain "wasting away" if you rely too heavily on AI. What does that look like for you day-to-day?

User: Many times, especially when coming up with social media post ideas, I think it would be so easy to just pop a simple prompt into AI and let it do its thing. I have to exercise those restraints that I have put in place for myself so that I continue to use my own thought process. Sometimes I feel it would be easier to just start with AI, and I might actually do that on a day where I have zero time or am in a crunch. However, I always feel a little like a cheater and unoriginal when I do that. My work is my personality in a way and if I am posting something or coming up with a creative idea for work, I want to be able to say that it's mine and not just an AI prompt generation. Keeping in touch with me as a person helps me maintain those guardrails when using AI. This is also true of writing. I have to do some business writing and have always prided myself on being a good writer. I feel those skills are going downhill due to the ease of just plugging in a prompt and having a letter done at my convenience. I don't feel I can actually take credit for it, which actually dampers my self confidence a bit.

AI: That's really honest and insightful - there's clearly a tension between the convenience AI offers and wanting to maintain your sense of creative ownership and skill development. It sounds like when you do use AI as a starting point, it leaves you feeling less connected to the final result.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Both in terms of the work itself and how you feel about your creative process?

User: I would say that it just comes around to being a bit of a faster process, especially with social media posts. I have so much information right at my fingertips and don't have to dig around to come up with ideas as I have in the past. And even though it's more convenient, I feel it still takes away from my own creative process in some ways. However, I am usually pleased with the ideas that are recommended that maybe I wouldn't have thought of on my own. However, it's' still a sticky situation because I always feel like I can't really take full credit for those ideas. It feels much better to show my boss a post and say that I came up with it from my own brain rather than using AI and then showing the boss and having to admit that it didn't come from my own brain but AI instead. Overall, even though I have tried not to let the addition of AI take away some of my creative process, it has definitely had an impact on it still. Again, its the same idea where I feel less proud of projects when AI is involved.

AI: That sense of pride in your work really comes through - it sounds like there's something fundamentally different about how you feel when you can say "I came up with this" versus when AI played a role, even if the final result is good.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Broadly speaking, I fear we are entering an era where humans have no original ideas. If we don't work to continue the brainstorming process in our own minds, it is a skill that will ultimately be left behind for humanity. I already see this in younger people who have basically known AI their entire lives. And surely there is a limit to AI, meaning the world might become a very boring place with limited ideas. Will all media start to look the same? Also, will we enter a time where we can't believe anything we see is real and must assume it is AI generated? Ultimately, it may be true that my job will no longer exist, as social media will just be managed solely by AI. That seems rather damaging.

AI: Those are some profound concerns - the idea that we might lose fundamental human skills like brainstorming, and that creativity itself could become homogenized. The point about younger people who've grown up with AI is particularly striking.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll maintain those same guardrails, or might your approach change?

User: I desperately want to keep those guardrails, but it is human design to give in to easier ways. I do fear I will rely on it more and more, even though the intent exists to avoid this. I will say that working behind the scenes being an AI trainer has given me a bit of a better perspective of AI since humans are behind the scenes of the training. However, I even see this being taken over and replaced with other AI models in the future, as this is already beginning on some of the projects I work on. My ultimate goal would be to continue the creative process as I am now. However, that's just not reality and things will always be evolving. I expect that I will eventually lean toward the human condition of conforming to the AI world and relying on it more and more. My hope is that AI developers will seek ways to make the process of relying on human input and feedback with models so that human creativity is not lost forever.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective on the tension between convenience and maintaining creative ownership - that internal struggle you described about feeling like "a cheater" when using AI as a starting point really illuminates something important about how creative professionals are navigating this new landscape.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authenticity while navigating the practical benefits of AI, and your concerns about preserving human creativity for future generations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about the internal conflicts many creative professionals are likely facing - that balance between efficiency and ownership is clearly something worth understanding better as we think about AI's role in creative work.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
