Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

If you're ready, I'd love to start by hearing about how AI fits into your typical workday. What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI every day, but when I do, it's usually to help me write social media captions. I'll give the demographic I'm trying to target with my social media post, and I'll usually ask AI to reword the caption I've thought of to better fit the demographic I'm trying to reach.

AI: That's a really specific use case - using AI to help tailor your messaging for different audiences. When you're working on these social media captions, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you come to the AI with a fully formed caption that you want adjusted, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation where you're developing the content together?

User: I will come with a caption that conveys the message that I want, but is worded in a way that I don't like. If I can't think of a better wording, I'll go to AI and ask for it to just reword it for me - I never ask AI to come up with a caption from scratch. If AI provides me a reworded caption that I don't like, I will send another message with more specific detail - like "make it sound more sophisticated" or "add an emoji at the end", for example.

AI: So you maintain control over the core message and use AI more as a writing partner to help you find the right tone and style. When you say you come with captions "worded in a way that I don't like," what specifically tends to feel off about your initial versions? Is it usually the tone, the length, or something else that prompts you to seek help with the rewording?

User: Usually the tone. I want to convey positive messages that don't seem cringy to 20-something year olds, so I go to AI to make it sound less cringy.

AI: That's such an interesting challenge - striking that balance between positive and authentic for that age group. When AI gives you a reworded version, how do you typically evaluate whether it's hit that sweet spot of being positive but not cringy? What signals tell you that it's working for your target audience?

User: It's really up to my discretion - I think too many emojis seems like it's a caption that is trying too hard, and therefore cringy. I think if it uses too simple or too complex of a vocabulary it doesn't really relate to my target demographic.

AI: That makes sense - you're really using your own intuition about what resonates with that demographic. I'm curious about something you mentioned earlier - you said you don't use AI every day, but when you do need help with social media captions, you turn to it. Are there other writing tasks where you could use AI but choose not to? What makes you decide to handle those yourself versus asking for AI assistance?

User: I usually like to think for myself. I am a critical thinker, and it's a skill I don't want to lose by asking AI to do my critical thinking for me. So yes, I could use AI to draft emails, but I don't. I'm capable of doing that myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - being intentional about preserving your critical thinking skills. When it comes to social media captions specifically, how do you think about that balance? What makes caption rewording feel different from other writing tasks in terms of when it's okay to get AI assistance versus when you want to maintain that skill yourself?

User: Usually the captions I make are only a few words or a sentence - I think if I were writing paragraphs, I would want to write it myself, but just one sentence or so doesn't really seem lazy to me to ask for help.

AI: That distinction makes a lot of sense - the scope and complexity of the writing task influences when you feel comfortable using AI. I'm wondering about your workplace environment - do your colleagues or company culture have any influence on how you approach using AI for tasks like this? Are people generally open about using AI tools, or is it something you navigate more independently?

User: Some people do use AI tools, but it is not something that my workplace as a whole has adopted or has rules about. It's more of a 'everybody figure it out for themselves' type of thing.

AI: That "figure it out for yourself" approach sounds pretty common right now. Given that environment, can you think of a specific time when using AI for your social media work made you feel particularly satisfied or maybe frustrated? What was happening in that situation that created that feeling?

User: It doesn't usually make me feel a particular way - I know I'm talking to a computer and not a real person, so there's no reason to get mad or upset at something that doesn't even have feelings.

AI: That's a really grounded way to approach it. It sounds like you have a clear, practical relationship with AI as a tool. When you think about the future - maybe six months or a year from now - do you see yourself using AI in any new ways at work, or do you think you'll pretty much stick with this current approach of using it selectively for specific tasks like caption rewording?

User: I think I will stick to using it for the tasks I do now. My reasoning goes back to wanting to maintain my critical thinking and writing skills.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear reasoning about when and why you choose to use AI versus preserving your own skills - that intentional approach to maintaining your critical thinking abilities while still leveraging AI as a practical tool.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being selective and intentional with AI use - especially that balance between leveraging it as a practical tool while preserving your own skills - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
