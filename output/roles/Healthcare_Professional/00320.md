Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for a variety of tasks,  rewriting emails, analyzing, summarizing, and extracting information from government sources to use in reports.  I also use it for excel formulas, finding errors in reports and generating flyers.

AI: That's quite a range of tasks. It sounds like AI has become integrated across different aspects of your work - from communication to analysis to document creation.

When you mention analyzing and extracting information from government sources for reports, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: I manage a government grant so there are a number of reporting tasks as well as compliance issues I need to manage.  AI is able to quickly summarize Executive orders that may pertain to my particular grant and show me how I may or may not be in compliance, as well as  possible fixes.  It also has helped me understand NOFOs and the pertinent points that must be addressed when competing and writing for grants.  It has helped me write the needed Standardized Work Plans and summarized key dates for reporting.

AI: That sounds like AI is handling some pretty critical compliance and strategic work for you. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When there are tasks that involve HIPPA compliance or proprietary information, that is when I try not to use AI.  AI seems to fail alot in complex scheduling issues (such as designing a Standardized Patient Interaction with multiple rooms, tight schedules) so I have found that it goes faster when I do that myself (though it would be great if it was able to use parameters to help with those tasks)

AI: That makes a lot of sense - both the privacy concerns and the complex scheduling limitations you've run into.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I have found AI to be more effective when I am a collaborative partner, guiding it through each step and making the corrections for each iteration of the process.  If I delegate the tasks, it takes more time for me to make the needed corrections individually.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like you've developed a real working rhythm with AI. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes and no.  I work for a small university and the culture is still fearful of AI.  The faculty members are scared to embrace AI and see it as a thread to their existence.  Due to this viewpoint, I have found that it is best if I keep my use of AI in my dailywork private.  It is unfortunate because AI is such a useful tool but the fear of AI in academia is a real issue right now.

AI: That tension between finding AI genuinely helpful while needing to keep its use private sounds challenging to navigate. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Again, I'll go back to my example of using AI to help schedule a Standardized patient event.  We had 2 sets of Standardized Patients, they were divided into 2 groups, each with a different role.  There were specific time limits for each interaction the student teams needed to have and each of those interactions took place in 4 different spaces.  Two faculty members were to observe each group.  The availability of faculty members varied.  I tried to use AI to make a schedule, working with it so it would understand the parameters, (timing, # of students, faculty availability, etc.) but the variables seemed to overwhelm the model and it could not handle the request.  It was frustrating because I would find an error, explain the error and where it was, and what the rules for that particular point were (timing, rotations, etc) but the model could not recover.  It was a complete waste of time and has made me hesitant to allow AI to handle any complex task I may have or need help with.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you were putting in the effort to guide it through the parameters and it still couldn't maintain the constraints you'd established.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't worry about a degradation of my skills.  I see AI as a tool to help me refine those skills.  I always look for ways to learn from AI,(like understanding why my formula didn't work in Excel so that error doesn't occur again).  I incorporate AI's suggestions/rewrites but always put my voice in as well so it doesn't concern me to lose skills, I have found my skills have increased in other areas as well because I am not spending time on tasks like rewriting emails or double checking grammar.  I am able to focus my time on problem solving and creative tasks that are much more satisfying for me.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - using AI as a learning tool while freeing yourself up for more creative and problem-solving work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It is my hope that AI continues to evolve and can help take over some of the more mundane reporting tasks that I do.  As AI continues to grow, I am hoping that it can begin to handle some more setup tasks that take an inordinate amount of time for me (such as project planning in MS suite projects).  It would be great to be able to explain some admin tasks that it could do that way I could focus my time on tasks that really make a difference and are more professionally satisfying.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has become a learning tool that's actually enhanced your skills while freeing you up for more satisfying creative work - and the contrast with that academic culture where you need to keep your AI use private.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.  I hope I was able to share some insights about the struggles of AI usage as well as how much it has transformed my work and allowed me to be more focused on tasks that I enjoy, instead of the routine administrative work.  It has given great insight into creating course content for me to use as well.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about both the benefits - like becoming a collaborative learning tool and freeing you up for more meaningful work - and the real challenges, like complex scheduling limitations and navigating workplace culture, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about all aspects of your experience. Take care!
