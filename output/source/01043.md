Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no thats fine

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to research topics such as legislation and best practice in records management. I also use it to rewrite emails so they sound more professional and to make my ideas more coherent. I use it to draft reports, mostly just for structure as I prefer to rework the wording to suit me specifically and my context.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned using AI for research on legislation and best practices - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I am a privacy officer so sometimes I have to deal with privacy breaches or questions related to sharing information. I use AI to find the appropriate principals that can be applied to the current situation and use it as a sounding board for my ideas of how I should deal with a situation.
I also use it to quickly consult appropriate legislation that applies to my work context, like the public records act and the official information act (I live in New Zealand)

AI: That sounds like AI serves as both a research assistant and a thinking partner for you in complex privacy situations. When you use it as a "sounding board" for your ideas about handling a situation, what does that conversation typically look like? Are you bouncing fully-formed ideas off it, or working through the problem together?

User: working through ideas. Sometimes I have an idea about how I might deal with a situation and I find AI is a good substitute to talk through the idea if there is noone around I can talk to, or if the situation is confidential and I shouldn't talk to anyone else about it.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI as a confidential thinking partner when human consultation isn't appropriate. When you're working through these privacy situations with AI, how do you decide what aspects of the problem-solving you want to handle yourself versus what you're comfortable having AI help you think through?

User: I really just use AI to point me in the right direction. I would not trust 100% what a model says unfortunately but it does give me the framework to find the information I need. Sometimes it will point me to the wrong section of legislation but the thinking behind the AI suggestion is solid. Sometimes I push the model to validate its answer or give me opposing points of view that I can then weigh up

AI: That's really insightful - you're essentially using AI as a starting point but maintaining critical oversight. When you mentioned pushing the model to validate its answers or provide opposing viewpoints, can you give me an example of how that plays out? What prompts you to dig deeper like that?

User: generally if the model makes a factual statement that I am not 100% sure is correct I will ask for a source. Sometimes the models provide relevant sources but sometimes at this point the model will realize it is not correct. I often ask models to check thoroughly now because I have learnt this gets a more researched response. I don't want to present information in a work environment that is not factually correct so I have become pretty careful about accepting what a model says without checking

AI: That caution around factual accuracy in your work environment makes a lot sense, especially given the legal nature of privacy work. I'm curious about your colleagues or workplace culture - how have they influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others in your organization approach AI similarly, or have you developed your own methods?

User: very mixed. Some people are all for embracing it, I feel like this is a management thing because they are in a position to see the benefit of incorporating AI in our everyday work. Those who are lower down or pencil pushers you could say, are less interested in AI. I have also found a bit of snobbishness around the use of AI, its like some people think they are too good/smart to use it.

AI: That's a really interesting observation about the different attitudes across organizational levels. When you encounter that snobbishness or resistance from colleagues, does it affect how openly you use AI or talk about using it in your work? How do you navigate those dynamics?

User: It has affected how open I have been about the use of AI in the past. But I feel like there is a real shift in my workplace recently and I feel like I can be more open and positive about the use of AI. This is definitely because management are opening talking about it and how they use it to improve their work and productivity.

AI: That shift sounds significant - moving from having to be more cautious about discussing AI use to feeling more open about it. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I feel satisfied every time I get it to rewrite an email for me! I think I write OK but its so easy and quick to get AI to tidy up an email and I find that really satisfying. It has improved my confidence with communication

AI: That's wonderful that it's boosting your confidence with communication! On the flip side, have you had any particularly frustrating experiences with AI at work? What made those situations challenging?

User: Yes I do find it frustrating when the AI quotes specific sections of legislation that do not exist. It is usually based on actual legislation but it makes up the specifics. I wish it would just point me in the right direction rather than make up information as that is a time waste because I always have to check it anyway

AI: That's really frustrating - the made-up specifics actually create more work for you. You mentioned you've learned to ask models to "check thoroughly" now. How do you think about maintaining and developing your own expertise in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: i dont get what you mean?

AI: Sorry, let me ask that more clearly. Since you're using AI for research and drafting in your privacy work, do you ever think about keeping your own skills sharp in those areas? Or is that not really a concern for you?

User: yes I want to keep my own skills sharp and I guess I am doing this because I do check everything that AI tells me. My work also requires a fair bit of human experience, handling sensitive situations and peoples emotions, that I don't think AI can help with

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the human elements of your role like handling sensitive situations seem irreplaceable. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: I can see my use of AI only increasing. I think as we learn to use it in different way it will just become a part of normal life.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed that careful verification process and how the workplace culture shift has made you more comfortable being open about AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no thats all

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a confidential thinking partner, the importance of verification in legal work, and how workplace culture affects AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
