Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an entrepreneur, so I tend to use AI for responding to emails in a professional way when I am feeling a bit too emotionally charged and want to maintain composure. I also use it often for helping me with bookkeeping for my business through Quickbooks. Additionally, I use it for researching, drafting business documents, generating ideas for marketing and social media, editing our existing website, promotional materials, training documents/programs. I use it like a personal assistant, basically, because the one I already have on my team is more client-facing rather than technology-oriented. As a result, it tends to save me a lot of time and money in the long run that I would otherwise have to pay a second assistant or a bookkeeper to help me with.

AI: That's a comprehensive range of uses. You mentioned using AI when you're feeling emotionally charged and want to maintain composure in emails. Can you tell me more about that? What does that process look like for you?

User: Sometimes clients feel entitled in our line of work and want to complain for the sake of complaining, or don't agree with certain policies we have in place. It's often easy to get frustrated or angry and want to reply with something that would otherwise come across as rude, offensive, or unprofessional. When I know that I am not in the right headspace, I will often explain the situation to an AI that will help reassure me that I have the right to be upset, but also explain the other person's point of view and what might help calm them down or what they are looking for in the moment for me (and my business) to make it right for them. I can send screen shots of the email or an email chain for context, and it can help me draft a response and edit it as necessary depending on the situation.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful approach to managing those challenging interactions. When AI helps you see the other person's perspective like that, how does that change how you feel about the situation or your response?

User: It often helps me gain a bit of perspective so that I can speak to the client with understanding and empathy, rather than just writing the thoughts in my head that wouldn't otherwise take their emotions or perspective into account.

AI: That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, I often prefer to do writing tasks myself because I specific tone and style to my writing. I might ask AI for assistance in drafting something, but then I will take it and make it my own. Especially since people are so skeptical nowadays about how AI is being used in business contexts. Our clients want to know that we are still humans who care about their clients and we aren't just shoving them off to solve customer service complaints with an AI chatbot. I also find that AI tends to struggle with long context when I'm writing business documents. This often leads to me having to just get AI to help me with drafting an outline and then specific sub-sections and drafting them myself. For example, I was making a training manual for my employees and it wasn't able to get past a few pages of writing or analyzing the document before it started to hallucinate or forget things that I had told it. I have specific business practices, policies, and rules that I need it to remember or reference to make documents like that more personalized, which it often tends to forget. This usually leads to it incorporating practices that are against our company's morals or values. As an example, I was asking for help drafting a cleaning training manual, and within the long-context format, it started to forget that our company specifically only uses eco-friendly products. As I continued to ask for help in drafting the training manual, it started suggesting products that were not eco-friendly. This would be a major oversight if I just relied on the AI to do this task and didn't double check the work. I also find it it helpful for tasks like bookkeeping, but only when I am overseeing it directly to catch any mistakes or discrepancies. I also wish that I could trust it to work in agent mode and do tasks for me, but I find myself having to step in to intervene quite frequently because it's straying away from what it should be doing, or it ends up taking longer to teach the AI how to use the interface than it would be to just ask it to write the stuff and plug it all into another program myself. I also find it very useless in terms of crafting documents for me in outside softwares. For example, I can often get it to create a PDF or an excel spreadsheet that opens in another program, but if I return to download the document later on, it doesn't exist anymore and the document is gone forever if I forget to save it. I also find the canvas modes really frustrating to work with for certain AIs because after a certain amount of edits in long context, it just starts producing errors or repeating itself constantly. I would personally find an AI that works as a desktop application that could see your screen and make changes or edits for you might be more helpful for me, especially if it worked well.

AI: You've raised some really important points there. The issue with AI forgetting your company's specific values - like the eco-friendly products example - sounds particularly problematic. When you're working on those longer documents now, what's your typical interaction pattern? Are you collaborating with AI throughout the process, or do you tend to break things down and delegate specific pieces?

User: I do try to collaborate with the AI throughout the process. It often has ideas that I might not have considered, but it also incorporates a lot of things that might not apply to my business. It tends to default to office-based businesses where everyone works 9am-5pm and sits at a desk all day. There are so many businesses that are laboured or skilled trades that it doesn't tend to account for. I frequently have to correct it about the fact that we don't have a physical office space, we don't have regular meetings, and our cleaners work on-site at clients' houses directly, so I can't just easily call a "staff meeting," unless it's over the phone or planned as a meeting at a public space ahead of time.

AI: That's a really interesting challenge - it sounds like AI has these built-in assumptions about traditional office work that don't match your business reality. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about it with your team, or is it something you mostly use privately?

User: I mostly use it privately. A lot of the people on my team are older, so they don't exactly understand how it works or what it does. But often times it's much more helpful and lets me be more productive than they would if I had them in the same assistant-type role. I have mentioned that I've used it and my administrative assistant seems to enjoy the fact that she can also use it for emails sometimes, but it seems to be more convenience-based than anything.

AI: That makes sense. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I was satisfied with AI was when it helped me draft a communications document in a short period of time that helped quickly clarify a lot of communication issues that our team had been having over the summer, and getting everyone to sign off on it so that we all had the same expectations for how we should communicate as a team and what was expected of them individually. I think the idea was great. I hadn't thought of it myself at all, the AI suggested it. And it does seem to have helped my team a lot. 

Situations where AI at work tends to make me particularly frustrated is when I'm doing bookkeeping because it can't see exactly what's on my screen or how things are working or affecting each other. It requires so much problem solving and I don't have a degree or any experience in accounting, so I often don't realize there's a mistake until it completely screws something up and I have to backtrack to find the error. Even when I ask the AI where the error might be, it just says all the calculations are correct, even with high reasoning models. It's not until I actually find the error and point it out that it's able to help me fix it, but then it will continue to make the same mistake the next time without learning from the situation previously.

AI: That communication document success story is really compelling - it sounds like AI helped you solve a problem you didn't even know you needed to address. The bookkeeping frustration makes a lot of sense too, especially when you can't easily verify the work yourself. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: What do you mean, exactly?

AI: I'm thinking about skills that AI might be getting better at handling - like some of the writing tasks you mentioned, or research, or even some aspects of business planning. Do you ever worry about becoming too dependent on AI for certain tasks, or think about making sure you can still do those things yourself if needed?

User: Ah, I see. Yes, I absolutely do think I rely on AI tools quite a bit, but I have always made sure that I only rely on them in ways that just help speed up my work, rather than relying on them entirely. For example, I could spend thirty minutes to an hour writing the perfect email to a client or an employee about a serious matter, or I could spend 5 minutes giving an AI context, having it draft the email, and spend another 5 minutes revising/editing it and adding important details that it missed or might not have known to include.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as a starting point rather than the final product. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm not entirely sure. I don't feel like I could ever fully trust it in terms of having an agental role in my business. But I am hoping that maybe as the technology evolves, it becomes integrated with other software, hardware, or tools in a way that can ultimately be more helpful. For example, instead of having to use a separate tab for an AI in my browser open to ask it questions about an article I'm reading, if I could just have a button or extension in the browser to ask it directly from that page. Or I could highlight a word and ask it to provide synonyms for that word. Just little things like that that would seem intuitive, I think, rather than having to open a new tab in the browser to google "synonyms for altruistic" or something. I really like the idea of canvas features, but I think I wouldn't be fully on board unless it basically acted like Grammarly, if that makes sense? Like, if you could just highlight a sentence and the AI could reword it for you, you could describe the exact changes you wanted it to make, or ask it to proofread it. I know there are AI technologies now that do similar things, but they don't really work as I would expect. So maybe, I guess I'm hoping that's how my relationship with AI could evolve in the future.

AI: That vision of more seamless, integrated AI assistance makes a lot of sense - almost like having it woven into the tools you already use rather than as a separate thing to manage.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to help manage emotionally charged situations while still maintaining your authentic voice and values.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of at this moment.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining authenticity, and your thoughtful approach to collaboration versus delegation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how you navigate these tools as an entrepreneur. Have a great rest of your day!
