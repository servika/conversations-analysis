Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, Claude. I have no questions at this time. Let's begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I predominantly use to better understand the different Excel functions available to me. Often enough, I have a very repetitive task to perform such as formatting a list of names, companies, addresses, product codes, contact information, billing information into specific formats intended for my company's SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. While I know some basic Excel functions and macros, the rise of AI has allowed me to use more complex functions that I had never heard of before. I will find myself looking at a massive spreadsheet with hundreds or thousands of rows and think to myself 'There's probably a macro or something that can save me a lot of time with this', and there pretty much always is.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has opened up a whole new toolkit for you in Excel. 

When you're facing one of those massive spreadsheets and thinking "there's probably a macro for this," what does your process look like from that moment? Do you describe your specific situation to the AI, or do you approach it differently?

User: That's a nice thought-provoking question. I don't always know the specific terminology related to what I hope to achieve, so I keep it very basic. I understand things like vLookup and Pivot Tables, but even then I prefer to break my goal down for the AI in the most common terms I can. How to best phrase this? Here is a simplified example utilizing a more basic Excel formula.  I'll start from a 'zoomed out' perspective of the entire task before delving into the minutiae.  I'll say something like "I have an Excel workbook. It has two sheets within. One sheet is called Master Product List and other is called Coca Cola Products. The first sheet, Master Product List, has product codes in column A, and other assorted pieces of information up until column P. The second sheet, Coca Cola Products, has a list of 400 products (also in column A) that my client wants me to load onto an Employee Uniform Portal that I am building for them, in addition to over a thousand product codes that were loaded previously. The remaining columns are in use up until column R. Both of these sheets have headers, so all data starts on row 2. The issue is that I cannot load a duplicate or it will reset the original settings, resulting in much more work for me. I would have to redo all of the settings for pricing, logos, media, and more in order to restore the work that I had previously done. Please provide me with a formula that checks which product codes in column A of the second sheet already exist in column A of the first sheet. Those that do not are going to be new codes I will have to load into my Master Product List before cloning them into the client's storefront. 

Then, as the AI responds and I try the formulas it provides, I will let it know "The formula returns a bunch of # symbols" or  "Nothing happened" and we take it from there testing out potential culprits like cell formatting.

AI: That's a really detailed example - I can see how you break down the entire context before getting into the specifics. It sounds like you've developed a systematic approach where you paint the full picture first.

When the AI gives you a formula that doesn't work right away - like when you get those # symbols - how do you feel in those moments? Are you confident it will get sorted out, or does it create any frustration or doubt about using AI for these tasks?

User: The very first 1-3 times it occurred, I had a slight feeling of "Maybe my Excel is the wrong version", "What if I have to enter some sort of debug/developer mode before doing this", or other random anxious thoughts related to my potential incompetence in relaying my needs. I definitely harbored some doubts, but perhaps they were more about myself than the AI. Ah, that felt pitiful to write. Each time, though, it worked out. Now that you mention it, this is precisely how I developed my approach. The basic approach serves to alert the AI to my level of expertise. This way, it won't hit me with a 'You must calibrate the gyrochronatom before achieving the singularity through the reformation of cells A through E.  Behold! I bestow unto you the boon of 'Currency' formatting."

Since those first few times, though, I definitely simplify my description of my goal as well as my description of my efforts until that point in the help-seeking process. This usually leads to a quick resolution to the errors. I no longer have any doubts about whether it will get sorted out or not, as I have confidence in being able to articulate the situation in a way that the AI will understand.

AI: That's a fascinating evolution - from those initial anxious thoughts about your own competence to now having confidence in your ability to communicate with the AI. It sounds like you've essentially learned how to "speak AI" in a way that gets results.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on these Excel tasks. Are there certain parts of the spreadsheet work you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with those areas too?

User: If it only concerns a few rows, or is something exceedingly simple like a CONCAT, SUM, or LEFT/RIGHT function, I will do it myself. I can get it done in the same amount of time it would take me to boot up an AI site and ask the question. Also, when dealing with addresses, I will generally do things myself manually with text-to-column formatting. It is possible (or even likely) that there is an easier way that AI could alert me to, but given the variance in address formats (PO Boxes, back doors, side doors, loading docks, etc.) it is all but guaranteed I will need to manually comb over the data anyway.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've clearly identified where the efficiency tipping point is. The address example is particularly interesting because of all that variance you mentioned.

When you are using AI for the more complex Excel tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process - going back and forth as you test things - or do you tend to give it the full context upfront and expect it to deliver a complete solution?

User: It would be akin to the example I provided in my first response. (Please let me know if I need to paste it again.)  I provide as much information as I can from the get-go, and if I receive a fully functional solution in the first attempt, I essentially imagine all of humanity's deities smiling at me from the sky and giving me a bunch of thumbs-ups. If it doesn't pan out immediately, no big deal, I will happily collaborate until it is resolved. What's my alternative, dusting off my 'Excel for Dummies' book from the 90s and pulling an all-nighter? I refuse! I will happily collaborate even if it takes 50 turns of conversation. (It never does, thankfully.)

AI: I love that image of all the deities giving you thumbs-ups! It sounds like you've found a really effective balance - starting with the comprehensive context but being totally comfortable with the iterative process when needed.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about it with coworkers, or is it more of a personal workflow choice?

User: They have not influenced it at all. Most of my workplace is centered around the business aspect of things, and they are not too well-versed in tech. I'm considered the defacto I.T guy despite being little more than a lifelong PC hobbyist. I've told a few of them about the various chatbots they could use, particularly for things like Excel, or drafting product copy, and they have been very receptive to it. If I can save everyone some time, I am happy to do so.

AI: That's interesting that you're in this unique position as the unofficial tech person. It sounds like you're somewhat of a pioneer in your workplace when it comes to AI adoption.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: No particularly frustrating moment comes to mind, but the first time I was able to combo a vLookup/Match-Index with a pivot table thanks to AI was very satisfying. I was fully expecting a task that would take me 3-4 days with manual sorting and organizing, but managed to complete it after 30 minutes of trial and error with an AI. It was fantastic, and I knew at that moment that AI could help me do almost anything involving data or formatting in the workplace, as long as I knew the right questions to ask.

AI: That sounds like a real breakthrough moment - going from expecting 3-4 days of work to finishing in 30 minutes must have been incredible. It's interesting how that experience gave you such confidence about AI's potential for data work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't actively consider it, no. My work centers around SAP S/4HANA Cloud, so my workplace would still need someone familiar with our specific modules to set everything up for automation. Even if it could be fully automated, there is a lot of potential for one-off scenarios that the AI models might not be prepared for. Some sort of oversight would be necessary. At least for the next few years, I presume.  If that time ever comes, I am certain I will be able to pivot to a neighboring path.

AI: That's a really pragmatic perspective - recognizing that even with AI advancement, you still need someone who understands the specific business context and can handle those one-off scenarios.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from where you are now?

User: I hope it does evolve, honestly. I hope I could use it to discover functions in SAP the way I have been able to with Excel. I am not certain it will change too much from where it is now... As it stands, the modules in SAP are too varied from company-to-company to get a specific answer from an AI in the way that I am able to with Excel. My 'super dumbed down' approach to explaining my objective would not work as well in such a use-case due to the relative lack of standardization in such modules. I more frequently ask myself 'Can AI accelerate this for me?' when I have a task spring up, compared to 2 years ago, though, so who knows what other use-cases I can discover to make my worklife easier in another year.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed that "speak AI" approach and how that breakthrough moment with the vLookup/pivot table combination really opened up possibilities for you.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thank you Claude. You've asked great questions that inspired some answers I didn't know I had in me. I can think of nothing else to add.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that communication style with AI, the evolution from initial doubts to confidence, and your practical approach to deciding when AI is worth using versus doing things yourself - it's all been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about the whole journey, from those first anxious moments to becoming the unofficial AI advocate in your workplace. Have a great rest of your day!
