Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No let's start

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: My research projects mainly laboratory based as I'm studying Medicinal Chemistry. I collect as much data as I can from the experiments, and write a report about them. This reuiqres extensive research, calculations, data analysis and evaluations, and the final product looks something similar to a study you find on PubMed. A recent project was on the effects of temperature on the pseudo-rate constants of the acid-catalysed ester hydrolysis of methyl acetate.

AI: That sounds like a really thorough process - from the experimental work all the way through to producing a publication-ready study. I can see how that would involve multiple stages of work, from the actual lab experiments to all that data analysis and writing.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Previously, I had bad experience with AI in terms of accuracy, so much so that I had contact my professor regarding the problem. Thereafter, I solely use AI to reword sentences, as it saves a little bit time trying to make a long confusing sentence more concise. I also use it for advice on the general presentation of the report, as it's always good to have a different perspective.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you had a significant trust issue early on that really shaped how you approach AI now. You mentioned you had to contact your professor about an accuracy problem - that must have been a pretty impactful experience.

For the sentence rewording and presentation advice that you do use AI for now, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those specific tasks.

User: Honestly, my traditional approach worked perfectly fine, it just took time to tweak to the point where I thought it was acceptable to submit. Using AI speeds this up, as I can  just tell it my ideas, and how I want a sentence to come across, and it fires back some ideas, and I can go back forth to dial it just how I want it. The presentation part is more of me overthinking it; I just need someone who I know is not going to plagiarise my work, to give me advice on what would look more professional/scientific.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using it as more of an efficiency tool for tasks where you already know what good looks like, rather than relying on it for the core content or analysis.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the data analysis, calculations, or the literature research you mentioned - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Again, it was the past experience that I had, it caused me over 3 hours of researching a niche topic. It's not something I can be entirely reliant on, and also I find those parts quite fun. Nothing is more satisfying than calculating your own % yield.

AI: That three-hour research detour sounds really frustrating - I can absolutely see how that would make you cautious about trusting AI for the more critical parts of your work. And I love that you find those analytical parts enjoyable - there's definitely something satisfying about working through the calculations yourself.

When you do use AI for the sentence rewording and presentation advice, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: You said it yourself, I already know what sounds good, and I read it many times over. Of course, I make mistakes sometimes, but they've never been because of how a sentence reads. I also compare my work to other publications.

AI: That's a smart approach - leveraging your existing expertise to quality-check the output. You're essentially using AI as a drafting tool while keeping yourself as the final judge.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Here's my last question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I can't put into words how much I want it to be able to compile the data exactly I want. Excel data sheets can be very time consuming, expecially when I have lots of data to work with.

AI: That's such a practical need - I can imagine data compilation and organization being one of those tedious but essential parts of research that just eats up so much time. The specificity of how you need the data formatted probably makes it even more challenging.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how that early accuracy issue really shaped your cautious but strategic approach to AI were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how one negative experience can really define someone's relationship with AI, and how you've found this middle ground of using it for efficiency while maintaining control over the critical work, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I really appreciate your time today!
