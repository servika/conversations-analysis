Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: mostly programming but a little bit of marketing. Generating social media posts and email marketing templates would be some examples.

AI: Tell me more about the programming side - what specific programming tasks do you find yourself turning to AI for?

User: I usually try to break tasks down to smaller pieces and have ai solve the pieces.
1. writing/finishing functions
2. commenting or writing doc strings for code
3. refactoring

Once in a while, I use AI for design. For example, I was working on making a wrapper for sqlite api in rust and I wanted to design a wrapper with certain specifications. I asked claude to help refine the design I had. Usually when I'm in the design stage I specifically ask claude to not give me any code.

AI: That's really interesting that you specifically ask Claude not to give you code during the design stage. What makes you want to keep the design conversation separate from the actual code implementation?

User: simplicity. a design can capture thousands or tens of thousands of lines of code. A painter first has to think about drawing a cat then drawe it, not think about it and draw it at the same time

AI: That's a compelling analogy. When you do move from design to implementation and start breaking tasks into those smaller pieces you mentioned, how do you typically work with AI on each piece? Are you collaborating back and forth, or do you give it a complete specification and let it handle the piece independently?

User: I don't have a good answer to that. That part is more art than science. I would prefer to code everything myself. If I let Ai do everything then I won't know the details of the system and I wont be able to fix bugs. If I do everything myself then whats the point of AI. I try to have a collaborative session where I do as much as I can, and I ask the AI very specific questions on how to solve w

AI: You were saying you ask the AI very specific questions on how to solve something - could you finish that thought? I'm curious about what those specific questions look like.

User: yes, pressed enter by accident. when I get to a problem,specially if it's a simple (maybe syntax related issue) I just ask claude because its fast and its gonna get it right. I try to not ask for large chunks of code. I also dont always go a great job commenting code while writing code, so if I finish a function and it's not well commented, I just ask claude to do it. Same with doc strings.

AI: That gives me a clear picture of your approach. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you'd prefer to code everything yourself ideally - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you're comfortable delegating?

User: two parts to that
1. Knowing enough of the small details to be able to fix the system later. You can just come up with a design and let claude code everything or you wouldnt know how the system works on a micro level. I want to be involved with almost every part of the system, unless its super repetitive boiler plate code
2. personal preference. Is it personal prject? then yeah i want to have fun coding. is it for work, then the objective is to make as many PRs as I can

AI: That distinction between personal projects and work is fascinating. Tell me more about that - how does your interaction with AI change when you're at work focused on maximizing PRs versus when you're working on something personal?

User: It doesn't. At least not in an interesting way. If it's a personal project then I like getting the dopamine of writing some code and hitting run and seeing it work. If it's work then ... it's just work that needs to be done

AI: You mentioned workplace dynamics briefly - how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Usually the other way around. I was one of the first people to really adopt using AI when everyone was saying "ai makes mistakes" and similar things

AI: So you were kind of leading the charge. What was it like being an early adopter when others were more skeptical? How did you navigate those conversations with colleagues who had concerns about AI making mistakes?

User: Another boring answer. They just eventually realized that they were sorely wrong.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'll do you one better and share one that did both. I was working on a flutter app. At first I started vibe coding and it was going really fast and I was loving it. I was letting ai do most of the work (lesson learned) and after like a week, I basically couldnt work on the project anymore because I had no idea how anything worked. I'm exagerating a little but eventually the rate of progress became slower than if I just had not used ai

AI: That's a perfect example of what you mentioned earlier about needing to know the system details. When you hit that wall where progress slowed down, how did you get yourself out of that situation? Did you have to go back and learn the codebase AI had created, or did you take a different approach?

User: it was a small hobby project. i abandoned it

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your current approach of staying involved in almost every part of the system will change?

User: Yes and no. Being involved with the details doesnt mean the AI cant do it by itself. Maybe even now the Ai can finish the app I abandoned in its entirety. Being involved is me looking at the code being generated and telling the AI exactly what the code needs to do so I have a deep understanding of how everything works. I'm ok with ai writing 100% of the code as long as I know how it works

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while ensuring you understand the system deeply enough to debug and maintain it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: AI being too agreeable has made me change how I prompt. If my prompt suggest A over B then Ai will be more likely to suggest A over B. I wish AI didnt care about my feelings at all

AI: That's a really insightful observation. Thank you for sharing that - it's exactly the kind of nuanced experience that helps us understand how people actually interact with AI tools in practice. The point about AI agreeability affecting the quality of technical feedback is particularly valuable.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between efficiency and understanding, along with that candid example about the Flutter project, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
