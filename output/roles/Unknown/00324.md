Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Begin.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Helping me polish and condense fairly short (~1000 words) articles for publication in a business magazine, based on content I provide to the AI (i.e., the finished version). I also use it to help craft snappy ledes, headlines, and subheads.

AI: That's a really specific workflow you've developed. When you're working on polishing these articles, can you walk me through what that collaboration looks like? Are you going back and forth with the AI throughout the editing process, or do you typically give it the full piece and let it handle the polishing independently?

User: I give it the full piece along with instructions such as, "Make this more concise but do not change any quotes. Do not leave out any quotes. I need this to be 850 words."

AI: So you're delegating the complete polishing task with clear parameters. Tell me more about those instructions you give - how did you develop that approach of being so specific about things like preserving quotes and hitting exact word counts?

User: I asked an AI to condense an article to 850 words. It reworded quotes but kept them in quotation marks, which is pretty bad. It also deleted some quotes.

AI: That sounds like it created a real problem for you. How did that experience shape the way you work with AI now? Do you find yourself being more cautious or specific about other aspects of your work with AI beyond just the quotes?

User: It does make me more cautious. I recently worked on an article that included two sources. I was very careful to tell the AI assistant not to remove or change any quotes, then I triple checked that it did not misattribute any of those quotes.

AI: That triple-checking you mentioned - tell me more about that process. What specifically are you looking for when you're verifying the AI's work, and how much time does that verification typically take compared to the original task?

User: With two windows open on my computer, I checked my original text with what the model produced. It did not take long, but I had to do that for peace of mind.

AI: That peace of mind piece is interesting. When you think about tasks in your work, are there other areas where you prefer to handle things yourself rather than use AI, even if it could potentially help? What drives those decisions for you?

User: I have used AI to come up with questions for interviews, and it does a great job. Other than rewording quotes, which in my field is forbidden and could be very bad, I haven't had any experiences that might compel me to not use AI, especially when it comes to writing headlines and subheads. I often tweak those things, but they give me a good jumping-off point.

AI: You mentioned tweaking the headlines and subheads that AI generates. Can you describe what those tweaks usually involve? What is it about the AI's suggestions that works well as a starting point, but still needs your touch?

User: It can be less specific than I want. Since I write for a regional publication, headlines need to focus on that aspect (i.e., using the name of a specific university or business).

AI: That regional specificity makes a lot of sense. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk openly about using these tools, or is it more of an individual decision?

User: As a freelance writer, I am not in a traditional work setting, and have zero interaction with peers. I only work directly with the publisher and an editor. I do not talk openly about using these tools.

AI: Interesting - so you haven't discussed your AI use with the publisher or editor. Can you tell me more about that decision? What factors go into keeping that part of your process private?

User: Correct -- I have not discussed my AI use with the publisher or my editor. Here's why: Many writers use tools such as Grammerly, which does largely the same thing for which I use AI, so what I am doing is not out of the ordinary. Also, I would not want the publisher or editor to think I am relying on AI too much. And, kind of sneakily, I don't want them to realize how easy it would be for them to rely more on AI instead of me.

AI: That last point about them potentially realizing they could rely more on AI - that's a really candid perspective. How do you think about maintaining your skills and value as a writer in areas where AI could potentially take over more work? Is this something you actively consider as you use these tools?

User: No, not really. For one, I have been a reporter and editor for 40 years. For two, the human touch will always be necessary, since in order to do a good interview you must know your subject and, more importantly, the direction you want the story to go in.

AI: That confidence in your experience and the human element really comes through. Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was past deadline because my subjects were incredibly difficult to reach. I ended up having to email them questions and wait for the communications office to respond with answers in the form of quotes. I wove those quotes into a story with intro sentences that I wrote, and rearranged the quotes to suit the article. But the article ended up being too long, and since I was under the gun I thought it could use some polishing. I popped the entire story into an AI assistant, which condensed it and made it sound more professional. It did an outstanding job.

AI: That sounds like AI really saved the day in a high-pressure situation. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it becoming a bigger or different part of your process?

User: It might evolve. I am considering doing an interview, transcribing it, and then handing it over to an AI assistant to write a story.

AI: That would be quite a shift from your current approach. Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your candid perspective about not wanting publishers to realize how easily they could rely more on AI instead of you - that tension between efficiency and job security feels really important.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes. While many people deride AI, they do not realize they are already using it, maybe through Alexa, maybe through Grammerly or other tools. I held off on using AI in writing because I considered that to be cheating. But I am confident enough in my own work, and the considerable effort I expend, that I think it is perfectly fine to rely on technology in some cases.

AI: That's a really valuable perspective - the idea that AI is already woven into so many tools people use without thinking about it, and how your confidence in your own skills and effort allows you to see it as just another technology rather than cheating. 

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI as a freelance writer, especially the practical considerations around client relationships and maintaining professional value, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
