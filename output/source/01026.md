Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Okay

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI regularly as a teacher. I use it to create activities, brainstorm new labs and projects, as well as make the notes I give to students more adapted to their needs. Occasionally I will use it for writing emails to parents or students, and for writing report card comments.

AI: That sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your teaching practice. 

When you're creating those activities and labs, could you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you come to AI with a rough idea and build it together, or do you usually give it specific parameters and let it generate something complete?

User: I usually have a standard or a unit that I want the lab to fit into. I have limited lab resources, so my labs often have to use non-standard materials to ensure we can do these labs, so I will tell it what I do not have available so we can try and find a lab that still teaches the content I want, but without traditional equiptment

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI to help solve resource constraints while still meeting your educational goals.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I would say I like to run most things through AI, but I still have to go through and edit most things to fit my style, and to make sure they are correct. I also use AI for summarizing educational research for me, because I like to keep in touch with the latest research on how people learn, but I will still read those articles myself if the synopsis from the AI is interesting because I enjoy reading educational research directly.

AI: So you're using AI as a kind of research filter to help you identify which articles are worth your deeper attention - that's a thoughtful approach.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate heavily. I often have to g

AI: It sounds like you were about to say more about your collaboration process - please go ahead and finish that thought.

User: I collaborate heavily. I often have to give multiple prompts in order to get AI to meet the requirements I want. For instance, when I am writing multiple choice questions, I find the typical multiple choice style that AI gives is very basic and not very aligned with my provincial standards. I have to give the AI multiple prompts and examples and collaborate heavily in order to get the outcome I want. When I am designing labs I also collaborate heavily to ensure that the lab is well suited to the outcomes I want to teach and the materials i have available. When I write notes I collaborate as well, and will often tell AI I want certain things rewritten, added, etc. I very rarely get them to delegate a complete task independently

AI: That gives me a clear picture of your collaborative approach - it sounds like you're really working together to refine things until they meet your specific standards and constraints.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not really. I am not aware of what my colleagues often do, and my workplace allows me to do my job however I see fit.

AI: That's interesting that you have that autonomy. It sounds like you've developed your own approach to using AI without much external influence.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I usually like enjoy when I create a really simplified text that aligns well with textbooks but is written in a simple manner that will work well for my ESL students. This is a task that used to take me ages to complete, so saving all this time is very satisfying. I often get frusterated when making multiple choice tests because the AI reverts to very basic levels of questioning and does not follow prompts over many turns in the conversation

AI: That contrast is really telling - the satisfaction when AI helps you create accessible materials for your ESL students versus the frustration when it can't maintain the complexity you need for assessments.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: can you give an example

AI: Sure - for instance, since AI helps you create simplified texts for your ESL students, do you ever think about whether you might lose your own ability to adapt complex material? Or since you use it for writing report card comments, do you consider whether your own writing skills in that area might get rusty?

I'm curious if you actively think about maintaining those skills yourself, or if it's not really a concern for you.

User: I do sometimes find that it takes me longer to think through the processes that I now tend to delegate to AI. I will definitely get rusty at those things, although I dont think I will lose the ability permanently.

AI: That's a thoughtful observation about how delegation affects your own processing. It sounds like you're aware of the trade-off but not particularly worried about it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope that I can use AI for more things, and be able to trust it more. At this point I have a pretty good sense for when AI will get things right, and not need as much hand holding, and when AI will make mistakes and I will need to look over that work more to double check. I look forward to it being more honest, and less likely to make mistakes

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've learned to recognize when AI needs more hand-holding versus when you can trust it to get things right.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I sometimes use AI to help me understand and work on my relationships with my colleagues. Although it is not directly work, I find that being able to discuss work stuff that happened with colleagues gives me a bit of "therapy" and helps me manage my day. I also use AI to suggest accomodations and adaptations that might work with particular groups of students

AI: That's really valuable to know - it sounds like AI serves as both a professional consultation tool for student accommodations and almost like a neutral sounding board for workplace dynamics. Those are quite different but both important aspects of your teaching practice.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from the collaborative nature of creating materials to using AI for that kind of reflective support will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you. Is the interview finished?

AI: Yes, the interview is finished! Thank you so much for participating and sharing such detailed insights about how you use AI in your teaching practice. Your responses have been really helpful for our research.
