Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then. 

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I vary from screenwriting, songwriting, and copywriting. A typical screenwriting project might be a pilot episode of an original idea or a spec episode of an existing show I like. For songs, I mostly write pop or pop rock songs, but I also help a friend with some briefs for KPOP. For copywriting, it depends on the client, but the most common is event announcements for an organization's newsletter.

AI: That's a fascinating range of creative work you do! It sounds like you're moving between very different creative modes - from long-form narrative storytelling to condensed lyrical expression to persuasive marketing copy.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I mostly just use AI for pre-planning or brainstorming for teleplays. For example, I have an original concept involving characters from different classic literature novels being in the same world, so I've used AI to remind myself of the plots of those novels (Moby Dick, Alice in Wonderland, etc.) and do some in depth character analysis of both major and obscure characters from those books. For spec scripts, I might ask it for a summary of a previous season or also do a character dive on the character from the show. For songwriting, I've asked for rhymes or if the syllable pattern makes sense. For copywriting, I usually just run it through for proofreading and ask if it can be improved or clarified.

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI differently across your different creative disciplines. It sounds like for screenwriting you're using it more for research and character development, while for songwriting it's more technical support, and copywriting is about refinement.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: This was more for fun, but I wrote a spec script of the golden girls. I ran some of the dialog through and asked it if the dialog I wrote was believable/true to the characters from the show. Like capturing Dorothy's sarcasm, Sophia's mischievousness, Blanche's flirtatiousness, and Rose's gullibility. I also provided it with an outline of the plot i came up with and asked if there were any gaps and if there was already an episode with a similar plot.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful way to use AI as a creative partner! Getting feedback on whether you've captured those distinct character voices must have been valuable - those Golden Girls characters have such specific personalities.

How did that feel for you as a writer? When the AI was evaluating whether your dialogue captured Dorothy's sarcasm or Rose's gullibility, what was that experience like?

User: It felt okay. I crave feedback all the time and have a thick skin, so I did feel it was a little too nice. It felt like it was just telling me what I wanted to hear, tbh, basically affirming that I did a good job at capturing the characters. I had some reservations of "feeding" my own creative work to the model, but since it was just a spec script of an existing IP from over 30 years ago, I didn't ultimately feel like my creative work was at risk of being consumed by the model and used without my permission.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the feedback quality - wanting more honest, critical feedback rather than just affirmation. And I appreciate you sharing that tension about feeding your work to the model.

When you're working with AI in these different ways, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in your process?

User: I think I'm still driving the creative decisions. As I mentioned, I just mainly use it for research support or to make sure there aren't any gaping plot holes or logical inconsistencies. It's easy to get very "in your head" when writing longform creative/stories, as you kinda internally connect the dots and already know where you're going for the most part. So that external set of eyes is helpful to make sure the story makes sense and isn't missing anything critical.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as that external perspective when you're too close to your own work. It sounds like you see yourself very much in the driver's seat, with AI serving more as a tool for quality assurance and research.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The actual creative portion hasn't changed much, as I try to have a hardline between my own creative contributions and the AI research. It has definitely sped up my research process, especially for the concept with the characters from classic literature. I've read all of the books I included at least once in my life, but it's helpful to have it as support so I don't have to pull out the physical book and scour it for a specific scene or quote. So I think the biggest aspect is that it's been a good source of like a fallback support system, but I do still try to lead with my own creativity and not depend on it to come up with any plot points.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making between the creative work and the research support. It sounds like you've been quite intentional about maintaining that boundary.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I think decision makers might use it to replace people, as it's cheaper and faster. I also have some concerns about writer's creative work being used to train models without their permission. I think models should only be trained on publicly available, already produced scripts and that AI should only be used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, human work.

AI: Those are really important concerns - both the economic pressure on creative professionals and the consent issues around training data. You mentioned having a clear boundary about using AI as a supplement rather than replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Ideally, the models will get smarter and be able to offer constructive feedback without being too sycophantic. There's nothing worse than asking for honest feedback and it just telling you what you want to hear. You'd look foolish if something doesn't work, but you believed the AI's sycophancy lol. Also, the models are still pretty bad at rhyme schemes. I usually only ask it for a list of words that rhyme with a given word, as opposed to asking it to following an ABAB rhyme pattern or something because it still fails pretty often. So hopefully it can get better at the bigger picture creative aspects of songwriting.

AI: That's really practical feedback - you want AI that can actually challenge your work constructively and better technical support for things like rhyme schemes. It sounds like you'd value AI that's more like a discerning creative collaborator rather than just an agreeable assistant.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI across your different creative disciplines. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that clear boundary between creative work and research support, and your honest take on wanting more critical feedback rather than just validation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I'm all set. Thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as research support while maintaining creative control, the challenges with getting honest feedback, and your thoughtful approach to the boundaries between human creativity and AI assistance will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your candor about both the benefits and limitations you've experienced. Thanks again, and best of luck with your screenwriting, songwriting, and copywriting projects!
