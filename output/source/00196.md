Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. You can begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI as a learning platform which aides my work as a bookkeeper. If I have a question pertaining to a skillset I will ask it to help me learn.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a learning tool to support your bookkeeping work. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? When you say you ask it to help you learn a skillset, what's a recent example of something you've learned this way?

User: For example, I could ask it a question about business tax laws in Canada. This would help keep me up to date on taxation laws.

AI: That makes sense - staying current with tax law changes is so important in your field.

Tell me more about how these learning conversations typically unfold. When you ask about Canadian tax laws, do you come with specific scenarios you're working on, or are you more exploring general updates and changes?

User: I'm more interested in learning general updates from it. If I have a client's file and I am currently bookkeeping for their business sometimes these tax laws are highly relevant to their business earnings and AI is a great learning tool for this.

AI: I see - so you're using AI to stay informed about general tax law changes, and then applying that knowledge to your clients' specific situations.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your bookkeeping work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to handle all mathematical problems myself as I trust my own calculations more than AI which can make errors sometimes.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - trusting your own calculations over AI for the mathematical work. 

When you use AI for learning about tax laws versus doing the actual calculations yourself, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with AI as you're working through learning something, or do you tend to ask it specific questions and then take that information away to apply on your own?

User: I ask it a specific question then cross reference the AI's response online to ensure that the answer from AI is correct before applying the concept to my learning. My interaction with AI is usually concise, straightforward, and to the point.

AI: That's a smart verification process - getting the AI's response and then cross-referencing it independently. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other bookkeepers you know approach AI differently, or is there a general attitude in your field about using these tools?

User: My colleagues use AI to learn like myself. But we do not involve it in mathematical calculations or important financial decisions.

AI: That sounds like there's a shared understanding in your field about where AI fits - and where it doesn't.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I remember asking AI a question about what bookkeeping softwares were very helpful to my profession. It provided me with a comprehensive list of softwares and this was satisfying.

AI: That's a great example of AI being helpful - getting that comprehensive overview of software options must have saved you a lot of research time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your bookkeeping work?

User: I think bookkeeping will alway needs a human to verify calculations and apply appropriate tax law to business earnings when handling their finances. However, I am not concerned about AI taking over my role as I think it helps bookkeepers improve their skillsets and is not a threat to them.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as a tool that enhances your capabilities rather than replaces them.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different purposes as time goes on?

User: I do not see myself using it differently. I plan to continue to use it as a learning tool in my workplace.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear approach to verification - how you cross-reference AI responses online before applying what you've learned, and your thoughtful boundaries around keeping the mathematical work in your own hands.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a learning tool while maintaining clear boundaries around calculations and verification have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
