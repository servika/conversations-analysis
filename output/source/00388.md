Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI a lot for helping to start projects or ideas. For example, when I'm hitting a wall with ideas for social media posts, I ask AI for suggestions. I also use AI to craft news stories and profiles based on answers people submit to a form that I send to AI. AI is helpful with checking for grammar mistakes, flow, and spelling errors in my writing. Lastly, I use AI to generate emails when I'm having difficulty with the tone and wording.

AI: That's a really diverse set of uses across different types of writing and communication. It sounds like AI serves as both a creative partner and an editor for you.

When you mention hitting a wall with social media ideas, can you walk me through what that interaction typically looks like? How do you approach AI when you're stuck like that?

User: I notify AI of the type of business that I am looking for ideas for and as much information about the business as possible or a link to the website so it can understand the demographics. I then ask it for ideas for social media posts for that week. Depending on what it sends me I give it feedback (need more business posts, need a humorous post, etc). I also ask it to incorporate any upcoming holidays. It will typically send me some suggested posts and captions and I provide feedback based on what we need that week. 

It's a good way to generate ideas that I hadn't thought of, though I find the captions to be pretty generic, depsite providing as much background info as possible, so I usually end up heavily editing the captions. 

It's also a great way to summarize articles where a business or person has been highlighted that we would want to share on social media.

AI: That's a really interesting collaborative process you've developed - it sounds like you've found a rhythm of back-and-forth feedback to refine what you need.

You mentioned that the captions tend to be generic despite providing detailed background information. What makes you choose to heavily edit those captions rather than, say, writing them from scratch yourself?

User: Mostly because AI has a good format and layout (intro, CTA, summarization) but lacks the personal details and it sounds pretty robotic. I can't think of the ideas so I use AI to do that and generate the initial caption, but then add in the personal details.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI for the structural foundation and then layering in the human touches that make it authentic.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I really love organization tasks and am very good at them. I don't fully trust AI with most organizational tasks because I'm worried it will miss something important.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like trust plays a big role in where you draw those boundaries.

Can you tell me more about what specifically you're worried AI might miss in those organizational tasks? What kinds of details or nuances feel too important to risk?

User: I'm worried it might miss a person or accidentally schedule something at the wrong time. I'm worried that if I trusted AI to do things that include other people and something or someone got forgotten it would reflect poorly on me or the business I'm representing.

AI: That really highlights the stakes involved when other people are counting on you. The accountability piece seems crucial there.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate throughout a task, that way I can ensure everything is accurate at each step. The exception to that is usually writing profiles or news stories. I send the complete form to the AI and ask it to generate the profile from that and it's usually a complete task.

AI: Interesting - so you have different approaches depending on the task. The profile writing sounds like one area where you're comfortable with more complete delegation.

What is it about those profile and news story tasks that makes you feel comfortable handing them over more completely, compared to something like the social media work where you collaborate step-by-step?

User: Usually because the person has already answered all the questions so the AI just needs to generate it in a story like format, all the information is already there so the AI is just generally rearranging it, so I feel more comfortable assigning it to the AI. I always double check for accuracy though.

AI: That makes perfect sense - when all the raw material is already there and verified, AI becomes more of a formatter than a content creator.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not really, they are supportive of AI overall, but don't necessarily encourage it or require it, but don't actively discourage it either.

AI: So it sounds like you have pretty much free rein to use AI as you see fit - that's interesting that the initiative has been entirely your own.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Last month I was using AI to generate social media captions and asking it about upcoming holidays. The AI kept suggesting holidays that had already happened or were too far in the future to post for the time frame (the next week) that I was looking for. I kept telling it that, but it still kept suggesting holidays that weren't helpful. That was extremely frustrating as I felt that it wasn't listening to me. 

On the other hand, last week when I was having trouble getting the proper wording for an email that carried bad news I gave the AI the information and it generated a very helpful email in exactly the tone I was looking for, saving me a lot of anxiety about crafting a helpful email.

AI: Those are such vivid examples of when AI either misses the mark completely or hits it perfectly. The holiday situation sounds maddening - like you were clearly communicating your needs but it wasn't registering.

The email example is really striking though. Can you tell me more about what made that tone so spot-on? What was it about that result that saved you the anxiety?

User: The email had to be firm as it was about a deadline, but needed to also be understanding of the situation the student was in. The AI was able to generate an email that sounded empathetic while still getting across the point that the deadline couldn't be extended. I often stress about sending those types of emails and will spend a long time trying to craft just the right message. AI saved me a lot of time and since it was generated by the AI it somehow felt less personal to me to send it. Even though it was me that was sending the email, knowing that it was an AI that initially wrote the words made it easier for me to send the bad news.

AI: That's such a fascinating insight - that having AI generate the initial words somehow created emotional distance that made a difficult task easier for you. It's like AI served as a buffer for the emotional weight of delivering bad news.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do! I believe that AI is here to stay and improving every day so I see it as a tool to help me grow my skills and be able to be better at my job. I still think that there will always be a need for human influence like through authentic interactions and storytelling, as well as fact checking. I have seen my skills change a bit as I'm needed less for administrative type tasks and more to be able to craft that human experience and interactions. I don't think it's necessarily about maintaining my skills in those areas, but adapting my skills to incorporate AI and make me better and more efficient at my job.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing it as skill evolution rather than skill preservation. The idea of shifting toward that human experience and authentic interaction makes a lot of sense.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm not fully sure. I work in higher education as an administrator so I imagine AI will likely start improving my organizational skills and perhaps even providing initial summaries of applicants and such. While that human component I don't think will ever fully go away, I could see AI providing initial reviews of applicants and using data to predict success in programs. I'm excited at how AI can improve things in the future.

AI: That excitement really comes through - it sounds like you see AI as opening up possibilities rather than closing them off, especially in higher education where there's so much data to work with.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can serve as an emotional buffer for difficult communications, and your view of skills evolving rather than just being preserved.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of your AI interactions, the trust considerations around organizational tasks, and especially that fascinating point about AI providing emotional distance for difficult communications - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were in walking through your actual workflows and the nuances of when and why you use AI differently across various tasks. Have a great rest of your day!
