Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for a variety of tasks throughout my day. I use it when writing professional emails, especially when I need to ensure that there is no emotion tied to my response and it is just straightforward. I use it to brainstorm activities and games that I can incorporate into the classroom. I also use it to create team bonding activities with fun names and jingles. I use it to help make unit plans and ensure that everything is linked to curricular outcomes.

AI: It sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of your teaching responsibilities. Tell me more about that process of removing emotion from your professional emails - what does that look like when you're working with AI on those?

User: I will often use it when corresponding with parents about their child, especially if it is in terms of negative behavior or learning challenges. I will also use it when I am responding to someone that I am frustrated with to ensure that it doesn't come off as passive aggressive.

AI: That's really interesting how you use it as a filter for those sensitive communications. When you're working on something like a parent email about behavioral issues, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you write a draft first and ask it to revise, or do you start by explaining the situation and have it write something from scratch?

User: I start by explaining the situation and include information that must be presented in the email, and let it create something from scratch. I then will often go back and forth making small changes so that it matches my tone, etc.

AI: So you're really collaborating with it through that back-and-forth process to get it just right. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, I still prefer to create my own assessments. While I may use AI to help generate some questions, the actual formatting and organizing I do on my own. I find that I do not like the formatting of the documents that I have had AI create for me.

AI: Tell me more about that formatting issue - what specifically about the AI's document formatting doesn't work for you?

User: I find it bland, and I want things to be visually appealing. The worksheets that have been generated by AI are very basic and come across as prescribed. The font used is standard, everything is spaced out evenly, they uses bolded headers to separate sections, and they are all aligned with the margin. There is nothing to make it stand out, or to make someone want to engage with the content. I like to change up the font, and include relevant images without having to have a conversation about where I want things placed. Same with presentations, there is a certain way that I like things done, I am quite particular, and AI doesn't successfully meet my expectations.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like the visual and creative elements are really important to how you connect with your students. When you do use AI for work tasks, you mentioned going back and forth to match your tone in emails. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was very satisfied and appreciative of the help from AI when I was creating my individualized program plans for students that require extra support. While it is still time consuming, before the support from AI, it would take me hours and hours because I want to ensure that I am including everything necessary, and that the information is something that can be tracked and updated throughout the year, and that there is enough information for parents to not question what we are doing. With the help of AI, I was able to create a template that I could follow for most of my students, along with outlier comments that are specific to each student. I could then take that template, and have AI create a new summary for parents based on the initial plan (similar terminology but ensure that it is varied enough to not come across as being copy and pasted).

AI: That sounds like AI really streamlined a process that was incredibly time-intensive for you. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people openly discussing it, or is it something you've figured out more on your own?

User: Earlier it was more of something that we figured out on our own, but now it is something that we discuss as a staff quite frequently. We now have personal development sessions on how to implement AI in the classroom, and I know from conversations with my coworkers, it has really been a game changer for our career and has saved so much time for us.

AI: It's interesting how that's evolved from individual exploration to something your whole staff is embracing together. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This is not something I have actively considered before, but thinking about it now, I do think it is important to be able to complete tasks independent of AI. Especially as technology is not always 100% (sometimes our internet cuts out or it is incredibly slow) and there are times where we won't have access to the support and we still need to be capable of completing these skills/tasks independently. I also think there is definitely something to be said about still including a more "human" representation because as incredible as AI is, it does not replace ideas/thoughts/emotions of a human.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on balancing efficiency with maintaining those human elements. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I do think that it will continue to evolve and continue to be integrated into my career more than now because there is always something new and useful being discovered/created, and the time saved by using it is priceless. I can see myself becoming more reliant on AI, which both scares an excites me.

AI: That's fascinating that you feel both scared and excited about becoming more reliant on it. Tell me more about what specifically excites you and what worries you about that increased reliance.

User: I am excited at the possibility of creating new fun and engaging activities for students that I never would have been able to come up with on my own, that makes learning more fun for students. I am worried about the social skills of the next generation, and that some students may rely on AI for their social interactions, instead of surrounding themselves with other people.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has transformed those time-intensive tasks like individualized program plans, and your thoughtful reflection on maintaining that human element while embracing the efficiency AI provides.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a collaborative partner and efficiency tool, especially in sensitive situations like parent communications and individualized student planning, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the benefits you've experienced and the concerns you have about the future. Take care!
