Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The most difficult part when it comes to research projects, for me, is always coming up with an initial idea. I struggle to brainstorm ideas and especially in contested fields it can be difficult. My current project involves molecular rotors, but the most difficult part for me was finding the initial idea. The rest of the stages, whether it be experimental design, literature review or the much later stages of conclusion drawing and report drafting, are usually a lot easier for me and I can get into a "flow" where I just progress on section after section.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you have a clear sense of where you naturally hit your stride versus where you get stuck. Tell me more about that initial ideation challenge, especially in contested fields. What does that struggle actually look like for you day-to-day?

User: For me, as someone who doesn't think of themselves as very creative, it can be very easy to see someone else's idea and think "oh that's great what if i did that too". However this is really detrimental when trying to come up with a unique perspective. Usually day to day this leads to me having to sift through hundreds of papers and note down interesting ideas, common views and the different ideas being tested. I never have a distinct idea of, I want to do that. It's quite gradual and more methodical in narrowing down potential areas.

AI: That methodical approach of sifting through hundreds of papers and gradually narrowing down areas sounds quite intensive. Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Recently with the influx of better and better AI tools, I have been using them for things like sifting through papers and albeit more limited, recently I have been using them to look through literature for my current project. This is because the ability of AI to summarise ideas is a really large time save and even though I do not have full confidence in results, it is fine in initial stages where I only need to roughly brainstorm. The main usage for me  is always asking AI to "summarise this paper and its findings", or prompts along this train of thought.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a way to speed up that initial sifting process when you need broad understanding rather than precision. For that specific task of summarizing papers and findings, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of reading through everything yourself.

User: It was mainly about time and efficiency. I like to be efficient with most things that I do and therefore with the influx of AI all around us and everyone saying this can help etc.. it was the logical next step to at least try it. While I am very "self" oriented when it comes to doing (I don't trust others with my own work and like to do stuff in my own way), I figured that using AI for something that does not take "skill" but more just time is a good starting place. I still do not have full confidence in models however and there is still time needed to check results and make sure they are on track.

AI: I can hear that balance you're striking - being efficiency-focused while also being very protective of your own work quality. You mentioned you "still do not have full confidence in models" and need time to check results. When you've used AI to summarize papers, how do you actually verify or validate what it produces?

User: The easiest way for me to do that is to grab the summarised paper that the AI made for me and noting down the key takeaways. These are usually important data points, conclusions on theory or just points relevant to what I asked for. After this, I just do a simple Ctrl + F to locate where in the paper this is mentioned and do a quick skim to check for correctness. This saves time since before the summary I do not know what the result will be and so I cannot easily find it with Ctrl + F.

AI: That's a clever verification workflow - using the AI summary as essentially a roadmap to find the key points more efficiently in the original paper. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI yet - like experimental design, conclusion drawing, or report drafting that you mentioned earlier - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I just do not have the confidence to let AI reproduce more creative, and also much more important areas of work. The biggest issue for me is that there just is not enough quality, especially in a highly specific STEM field. I cannot trust AI judgement on more important stages and especially not on things like design. There is a potential for using AI on grammar/proof reading and this is probably the most feasible next step, but for me I would not use current AI on the important stages. The only exception is data analysis. Usually this step can be tedious and sometimes more on the boring side (parsing through lists of readings, plotting etc..) and I have employed AI to help with coding/data analysis.

AI: That distinction you're making is really insightful - between tasks that are time-consuming but lower-stakes versus the creative, high-stakes work where you need full control. You mentioned data analysis as an exception where you have used AI for coding and parsing through data. Tell me more about that - what made data analysis feel different from those other important stages?

User: I have been using AI for things like coding for a little while and I trust this segment of AI a lot more. Its also because with things like coding/data analysis, if the AI gives wrong code it is very obvious. I can clearly see "oh well this is not what I should see". I think that models are much better at data analysis than actual conclusion drawing, especially in the chemistry field. I do still employ a bit of effort to check a lot of data analysis and usually the use of AI will just be to give me a starting point that I can build on. A framework of code for example to save me time.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the immediate feedback loop with coding where you can quickly see if something works or not gives you much more confidence. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't help with well, what would that be and why?

User: I would love AI to be very capable in the image generation field. This is because I do not really enjoy the creation of graphics and images. Examples include making reaction schemes and mechanisms, but most importantly is having to create energy level diagrams / MO diagrams. This would be insanely helpful but AI is no where near being able to create important and custom diagrams like this.

AI: That's fascinating - you'd want AI to handle the visual communication of complex scientific concepts that are so specific to your field. It sounds like you have a clear vision of where AI could really move the needle for you, but the technology just isn't there yet for those highly specialized diagrams.

Those are all my questions. Your perspectives on how you balance efficiency gains with maintaining control over the high-stakes creative work were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No I think thats everything thanks!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a verification roadmap for literature review and that clear distinction between high-stakes creative work versus time-consuming but lower-risk tasks really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's been really valuable to hear how you think about trust and verification in different contexts - from the immediate feedback of coding to the specialized knowledge needed for chemistry conclusions. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Have a great rest of your day!
