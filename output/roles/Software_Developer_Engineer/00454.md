Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, i have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for writing-heavy tasks, such as drafting emails.  I find it is much quicker to write a couple rough sentences on what I want the email to be about and then let AI generate it in a clean and professional way.  Then I proof read it myself and usually make some minor adjustments.

For work I regularly write internal news articles.  I use AI to turn my rough drafts into something more polished.  Often the process is super forgiving.  I can write incomplete sentences, with no consideration for grammar, flow, or format.  I just get the raw ideas into words.  Often I will use bullet-form.  Then I just get AI to turn my ideas into a professional-quality writeup.  Sometimes the ideas I am writing themselves can be incomplete, and AI will fill in the gaps.

I also use it for coding, but usually it is not that great.  I have my development environment configured so that it can provide autocomplete suggestions for the next section of code, based on what I have already written.  I find it is helpful for a longer than traditional autocomplete, but if it looks anything beyond 2-3 lines ahead it usually diverts from what I want.

AI: That's really helpful. I'm curious about the writing tasks you mentioned - it sounds like you have a pretty fluid back-and-forth with AI when polishing your drafts.

When you say AI sometimes fills in gaps in your incomplete ideas, can you tell me more about that? How do you decide whether to keep those AI additions or modify them?

User: Sometimes I will write up a few sentences that really rough out an idea, but they do not capture the complete thought.  It is similar to when you are talking with someone and cannot quite find the words to complete your thought, but you say "you know what I mean?" and they do.  So I will do this with AI, and sometimes it comes up with the words I could not to complete my thought.  To determine whether or not to keep the AI modifications really depends on if I feel it has accurately captured my idea.  AI is getting pretty good at articulating itself, so it is usually easy to determine if it understood my idea or not.  I find it is 50/50; sometimes AI understands, sometimes not.  If it does not, then I can usually correct it over the course of the conversation.

AI: That's a fascinating way to describe it - like having that "you know what I mean?" moment with a colleague. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Certainly.  Any high-stakes tasks that require careful attention I will usually lean on AI less for.  Hallucinations are a problem, so my approach is often using AI to start in the right direction, but I always assume the AI is lying to me.  This is the conservative assume-the-worst approach.

Some tasks, such as coding, I am hesitant to use AI for.  The reason is that I find is that my own skillset deteriorates if I use AI too much in that area.  For simple or repetitive coding  I will use AI, but for complex tasks I prefer to do them myself to "stay sharp."  If I do not take this caution, I am concerned that when I encounter tasks that are too complex for AI to do correctly (a common occurrence), I will find them much more difficult or impossible due to those skills being unused for a long period of time.

AI: That's really insightful - the concern about skills deteriorating when you rely too heavily on AI. 

When you do use AI for coding on those simple or repetitive tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: For really simple stuff with lots of boilerplate, I completely delegate to the AI.  Usually it gets it right, so the risk of me having to go clean it up is low.  In general, I collaborate with it by having it offer autocomplete suggestions for the rest of the line of code.  This does offer some speedup.

AI: That makes sense - using delegation for low-risk boilerplate and collaboration for the line-by-line work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Actually, I have been the one who introduced AI to my colleagues.  One of them tests different AI models and comments on their strengths and weaknesses.  Sometimes they will give me little tips on what model works best for what, or if there are updates they will let me know.  So far though, they have not influenced my use of AI, but I have heavily influenced theirs.

AI: Interesting - so you've been more of the AI pioneer in your workplace. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure.  This one time I was tasked with writing a success story news article on a successful engineering project.  It took maybe 45 minutes and when I was done, one of the fellow engineers commented that the writing was such high quality that I could be a journalist.  The trick: I had used AI to write the article using the rough drafting method I previously shared with you.  I was very pleased.

AI: That's a great example of feeling satisfied with the outcome. 

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would not say I get frustrated with AI.  Often I will use AI to see if I can do a task faster than if I did it manually.  If it does not work, then it is fine because I would have had to do it manually anyway.  

I will say that coding can be a little frustrating sometimes, as some of the code it produces can be way off from what I asked.

AI: That's a healthy perspective - treating it as an experiment to see if it can speed things up.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am not really worried about it.  I think those skills are important to maintain in order to know how to correctly guide the AI.  For example, just because my calculator can perform multiplication does not mean that I can forget how multiplication works.

AI: That's a great analogy with the calculator. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As it gets better I will lean on it more and more to help me with tasks.  I see it being useful for a lot more collaboration as it can handle more complexity.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI like you would a calculator - maintaining the underlying skills so you can guide it effectively.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that is all, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between delegation and collaboration, the importance of maintaining underlying skills, and your pragmatic approach to AI limitations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
