Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. That sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: It's used in my hospitals revenue department for eligibility and benefits verification and in coding and documentation specifically for assistance with denial prevention and clinical documentation like appeals

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI in some pretty critical healthcare revenue cycle areas. 

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI for something like eligibility verification or working on an appeal? What does that process actually look like day-to-day?

User: I will give an example in regards to working on an appeal, clinical staff with review patient clinical information (medical records, laboratory results, surgical notes) and assemble a medical necessity appeal to send to insurance companies for payment of claims. AI will then be utilized before submission suggesting rewording, fixes or adding additional information to bolster the appeal.

AI: That's a fascinating use case - having AI review and strengthen your appeals before submission. 

When AI suggests rewording or additional information for those appeals, how do you typically decide what to accept or reject from its suggestions? What goes through your mind as you're evaluating those recommendations?

User: My employer has a two layer approach before an appeal gets out the door after clinical appeal and AI review. Two people with a clinical background will review the documentation to 1. ensure the information AI provided is valid and not exaggerated or hallucinated and 2. confirming the wording is human like, realistic and not robotic or computer generated.

AI: That's a really thoughtful verification process your employer has set up. It sounds like there's a lot of care taken to ensure quality and accuracy.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your revenue cycle work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: A part of me enjoys some of the eligibility and benefits verification. Sometimes I enjoy research and locating obscure benefits that certain payers offer their customers. Its like a treasure hunt and rewarding when my research leads to savings for patient's. AI cuts that rewarding aspect out but gets the job done faster. So it's a double edged sword.

AI: That treasure hunt feeling you describe is really compelling - there's something satisfying about that detective work and knowing you've potentially saved a patient money through your own research skills.

When you're in situations where you could use AI for that eligibility work but you choose to do the research yourself instead, what usually drives that decision? Is it the mood you're in, the complexity of the case, or something else entirely?

User: Honestly it's a few things. If the case is extremely complex I'm likely to do the initial research myself because of the challenge then I will see what AI comes up with after my own research and another aspect is time. If it's a day or a week that I'm completely overloaded with tasks I'll rely on AI more for time management.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're balancing the intellectual satisfaction with practical demands. 

When you do use AI during those busy periods for time management, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the eligibility research process, or do you tend to give it the full task and let it handle it independently while you move on to other things?

User: During busy times I'll give AI the full task then double check the results afterward

AI: I can see how that delegation approach helps you manage your workload during those heavy periods.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the hospital or your department set any particular tone around AI adoption?

User: In my experience younger staff seem intrigued, even excited for advancements and improvements AI is bringing. Older staff are hesitant and worried.

AI: That's an interesting generational divide you're observing. 

Can you tell me more about what the older staff are worried about? What specific concerns do you hear them expressing about AI in your work environment?

User: I think there's several reasons they're worried. They don't understand the technology for one. I think they feel like their control is being taken away and put into the hands of robots. Also, they're worried about job security and what all the advancements mean for their role.

AI: Those concerns about control and job security really make sense, especially in such a specialized field where people have built deep expertise over years.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't think of one particular situation but I feel gratified every time a large balance claim that's a complex clinical case is submitted to an insurance company with a fantastic, well written and assembled clinical appeal (with the help of AI) and it gets paid. Specifically if it's a large payment over $100k. That feels like such a win.

AI: That must be an incredible feeling - especially knowing you've helped secure a major payment that could really impact both the hospital and potentially reduce a patient's financial burden.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over more responsibilities? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really worry you?

User: The thought crosses my mind but I'm confident that skilled humans will always be an integral part of every company. The human element can never be replaced.

AI: That's a confident perspective on the human element remaining essential.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently a year or two from now?

User: I think as AI improves it will undoubtedly evolve for the work my hospital does. I'm hoping in the next year or two it's even faster and smarter. I'm hoping it improves time management even more and is more skilled with clinical research.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that treasure hunt feeling with eligibility research and how you balance the intellectual satisfaction with practical time management needs.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in healthcare revenue cycle work - from the careful verification processes your hospital has in place to that rewarding feeling when a complex appeal gets paid - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
