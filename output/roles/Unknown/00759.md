Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope. continue

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for search, communication, summarization, and planning

AI: That's a nice range of applications. Can you walk me through what search looks like for you when you're using AI? How does that fit into your workflow?

User: I work for an enterprise organization with a lot of diverse documentation. Given the diversity, it's nice to be able to ask a question with natural language

AI: That makes a lot of sense - natural language search through diverse documentation sounds really valuable. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: In my experience, AI *sounds* accurate, but it still needs to have validation... it can't be trusted entirely. So, although I'd like to be able to say, "write up this document..." or "craft an email that says...", I still have to make sure that it's wordsmithed accurately.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the validation piece. So it sounds like you're still very much in the loop even when AI is helping with writing tasks.

When you do use AI for something like drafting an email or document, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you going back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it the full task and then review everything at the end?

User: I haven't found the "full task" and then review to be very effective. That said, while going back and forth is more effective for achieving a goal, sometimes the AI doesn't make the intended adjustments. At that point it's more frustrating. At least, that was my experience today

AI: Ah, sounds like you had a frustrating experience today where the AI wasn't picking up on the adjustments you wanted. That back-and-forth approach requiring multiple rounds can definitely be taxing.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people generally open about using it, or is there a particular approach your organization has taken?

User: I'm one of the more early adopters. That said, my boss is very pro AI, and over the last couple months we have had greater accessibility to enterprise AI tools. This is significant since a year ago legal and security were quite restrictive of our using it

AI: That's a significant shift - from legal and security restrictions to having enterprise AI tools available. It sounds like having a supportive boss has helped too.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfaction: Building an agent that *seems* to achieve the objective it was made for. Frustrated: that same agent was hallucinating its answers

AI: That's such a perfect example of the double-edged nature of AI right now - the excitement of building something that appears to work, followed by the letdown of discovering it's not actually reliable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think about it this way: AI won't take my job. But someone who knows how to use AI will

AI: That's a really pragmatic way to frame it. You're positioning yourself to be that person who knows how to use AI effectively.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It may not be immediate, but the ubiquity of "online" or "web" or "the cloud" ... One has to be online to do their job effectively... AI is going to be ubiquitous in the same way. Likely more revolutionary than the iphone in 2008-ish

AI: That's a powerful analogy - comparing AI's potential ubiquity to how essential being online became for work. The iPhone comparison is particularly striking given how fundamentally that changed how we interact with technology.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI "sounds" accurate but still needs validation - that really captures a key challenge people face.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from the validation challenges to building agents, and especially that perspective on AI becoming as ubiquitous as being online - that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
