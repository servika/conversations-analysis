Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI primarily for drafting communications. This could be emails, bulletins, portions of job aid documents where I can't get the wording right, and similar tasks. I may also use it to help me get organized for different projects, but I work with a lot of sensitive information in my job so I can't get too in depth with it.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you've found a specific niche where AI really helps you. When you mention using it for communications where you "can't get the wording right," what does that look like? Walk me through what happens when you turn to AI for help with wording.

User: If there is a step in a job aid that is going to be published for use across our department, sometimes I struggle with how to word the step so that someone unfamiliar with the process could easily understand it. Sometimes these aids can get too "wordy" and AI can help put it into simpler terms.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - turning technical knowledge into clear instructions for others is really challenging. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you work with sensitive information, so there are some natural boundaries there. But even setting that aside, are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to plan project outlines myself because I have years of experience and a better understanding of the reality of timelines when working with different teams. On paper, a team might say a process should take a week, but from experience and knowing how different times of the year can affect these departments, I know it can be closer to two weeks.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you're talking about the difference between theoretical knowledge and lived experience with organizational dynamics. It sounds like there's a lot of institutional knowledge that you've built up over time.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task. Since I primarily use it for writing assistance, I often ask for tweaks in tone or content and keep going until something feels right.

AI: That iterative approach sounds like a real conversation - going back and forth until you get to something that feels right. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people around you using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: We haven't had too many discussions about AI usage other than being aware of the security and data concerns. We use Microsoft software so we would likely use Copilot if there was a company- or department-wide push for its use.

AI: So it sounds like AI use is still pretty individual right now - people are figuring it out on their own rather than having formal guidance or shared practices.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I turned to AI to help me with my annual self-assessment and gave it information about my role and projects I completed to help it better understand what I might want to include for my short- and long-term goals. It wasn't quite grasping what my job is and what areas I would naturally explore as my career progresses. This is an instance where it would probably take specialized knowledge of not only this job, but the company I work for, to know what realistic opportunities are available to me.

AI: That's a really telling example - it highlights how AI can struggle when it needs that deep contextual knowledge about your specific role and organization. It sounds like there was a gap between what you could explain about your job and what AI would need to truly understand the career landscape you're navigating.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, it is a very real concern for many of our operations. However, we've worked with automated BOTs recently, and even they mess up. They are essentially following "if, then" instructions, and they still encounter many errors that require human intervention. The industry I'm in has MANY variables, and I think that there will still need to be human eyes on most (if not all) of the processes for a very long time.

AI: That experience with BOTs seems to give you a pretty grounded perspective on automation's limitations in complex, variable environments. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from how you use it now?

User: I could see using it more when it comes to project planning -- not in an "overall" sense, but hitting on specifics of each step of the project. I will very likely continue using it for communications. I consider myself good with grammar and drafting professional communications, but it never hurts to have options. Otherwise, I would have to see how the technology grows across our industry before knowing how it could apply to our mid-size company.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your experience with BOTs has shaped your realistic view of automation's limitations in complex environments.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that sweet spot for AI in communications work, the importance of institutional knowledge in project planning, and how real-world complexity creates natural boundaries for automation - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your experiences with me today!
