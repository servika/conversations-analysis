Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI fits in various different ways, from the equipment that I use as a rad tech to patient triage tools. I also use LLMs to complete tasks such as creating learning materials for students and staff and creating rotas. The MRI and CT scanners use AI based reconstructions, dose optimisation and protocol selection/adaptation. Patient triage systems will flag high priority patients based on various factors and data which will affect my workflow and order of priorities.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across so many different levels of your work as a rad tech. It sounds like some of these AI tools are built right into your equipment while others you're actively choosing to use for tasks like creating materials.

When you're using LLMs to create learning materials or rotas, what draws you to use AI for those particular tasks?

User: They are mundane and boring tasks that I prefer to delegate to LLMs to save time and essentially my own effort. These are things that need to be done on a weekly basis and AI could do it in less than 2 minutes whereas sometimes it takes me 20 minutes or more.

AI: That makes complete sense - getting those routine weekly tasks done in 2 minutes instead of 20 is a huge time saver. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you're happy to delegate?

User: I would not use an LLM for decision support or clinical decision making. I find that a lot of the advice given (pertaining to MRI and CT scanning) is often based on American ways of working and not British. For example, scanning protocols vary massively, and I have noticed that it often gives incorrect information that is very different to the widely accepted protocols. I would therefore prefer to do these sorts of things myself, and reach out to other members of staff, seeking advice from NICE guidelines or medical journals. These are typically things that would carry high risk and a potential impact to patients and therefore I would not use LLMs for this. For things that carry very little risk or implications, such as rotas and learning materials, I would delegate these tasks to AI.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - the risk level and potential patient impact seems to be a key factor in your decision-making. The point about AI giving American-based protocols that don't align with British practice is particularly interesting.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For those low-risk tasks like rotas and learning materials, are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to delegate the complete task for it to handle independently?

User: I will give it a strict list of requirements and constraints all in one prompt and see what it comes back with. If I think it needs refining, I will collaborate with it further but I would prefer if it could handle the entire task independently. I do find that there is quite a bit of fine tuning that I need to do and the LLM does not always follow my constraints or meet all my requirements.

AI: So you're looking for that independent handling but finding you often need to go back and forth to get it just right. It sounds like the constraints and requirements don't always get followed perfectly on the first try.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this differently than your coworkers?

User: I find a lot of my colleagues are using it for writing emails to clinicians, writing letters to patients, writing standard operating procedures, sometimes anonymised image interpretation, creating checklists, putting audit data in to extract key takeaways and findings, creating meeting minutes, presentation slides etc

AI: It sounds like AI use is fairly widespread among your colleagues for administrative and communication tasks. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was very satisfied when I gave AI data for a cannulation audit - that's when I collated data about the number of failed vs successful cannulations attempts in chemotherapy and immunotherapy patients in order to create a convincing business case for ultrasound guided cannulation training for the staff and funding for cannulation aids. It produced very good insights from the data given and produced a persuasive business case after presenting the data and giving me presentation slide suggestions.

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful success - using AI to help build a case that could ultimately improve patient care through better cannulation training and equipment. It's interesting how AI was able to take your audit data and help you present it in a way that was persuasive for getting the resources you needed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am really interested in the deployment of AI in various aspects of medicine and in my field of work technology is at the forefront of everything and AI is no exception. I am no stranger to AI, a lot of the equipment I have worked with has incorporated AI long before everybody became aware of the concept of AI and its prevalence. I am very open to AI and embrace it even in areas that it could possibly take over. I am actually welcoming the opportunity to improve my AI skills and work with it rather against it.

AI: That's such an insightful perspective - recognizing that AI has been part of your field for years, even before the current wave of awareness. Your approach of working with AI rather than against it seems really pragmatic.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that it will automate processes more for me at work and help me work quicker, ultimately improving the throughput of patients and the diagnosis of patients. For example, we have just deployed a software on our scanners and reporting systems that will create a radiology report and flag any abnormal findings. These patients will come through a national targeted lung health function check programme and AI will use heat maps to identify even the most subtle abnormalities that the human eye would be unlikely to pick up. This means there must be oversight of the technology, but also that a larger volume of patients scans can be reported and therefore the prognosis of such patients can be mitigated. Furthermore, I will continue delegating tasks to LLMs that can reduce the time I spend on such tasks drastically so that my efforts and attention can be concentrated elsewhere.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has actually been part of radiology for years, and how you think about risk levels when deciding what to delegate versus what to keep doing yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing else from me.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into healthcare work - from the equipment-level AI that's been around for years to the newer LLM applications, and especially how you navigate the risk considerations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
