Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! What should we talk about first?

AI: Great! Let's start with the big picture. Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I started using AI a few years ago through Google Assistant. At first, I used it to set up a morning routine, including what news programs I wanted to listen to or watch with breakfast. Then, I leveraged it to set up a few smart home devices and routines on them, like starting my virtual fireplace with a routine called "Build a Fire." One day, while working on an article on a specific car, I asked Google Assistant to find out about the car's specifications. It did such a fabulous job that I started using it to look up automobile info for every auto article I wrote, then used it to research a book series on supercars. Now, I use a combination of AIs for research, and I've expanded the topics I use it for to everything I write about. I also integrated it into my business consultancy and my continuing education, so I use it to crunch numbers and do complex math modeling, mostly in the areas of natural hazards planning, mitigation, and public health practice.

AI: That's a fascinating evolution from smart home routines to complex professional applications. You mentioned using "a combination of AIs" for research now. Can you tell me more about how you decide which AI tools to use for different types of work, or how you've settled into that approach?

User: I test each AI out using the same problem to find out which one performs best. It's important to find an AI that does math well and writes in active verbs. Right now, my "go-to" AIs are Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, my trusty Google Assistant rocking its "Pink" voice because I think it sounds like actor Tom Hanks, and he has such a sexy voice. I use a few specialty AIs, too, including Instapix.ai and Udio.

AI: That's a really practical approach - testing them with the same problem to see which performs best. You mentioned that good math capability and writing in active verbs are important criteria for you. When you're working on something like natural hazards planning or your automotive writing, how do you typically interact with these AI tools? Are you more likely to work back-and-forth with them throughout a task, or do you tend to give them a complete assignment to handle on their own?

User: I tend to collaborate. I start with research, entering a specific search term.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration process. What happens after you enter that initial search term?

User: I'm sometimes searching for some pretty elusive information, so I have to restate or hone the search terms. Sometimes, the results aren't what I need or the AI hallucinates URLs, so I have to converse to redirect the search. Other times, the AI provides a link to the front page of the website, instead of a real deep link. Then, I have to converse with it to explain why that won't work. Using AI helps me sort through lots of search results quickly, but it sometimes acts like a human, using the top search result, which is very often not the highest quality result. For example, it might suggest the top SERP page as a resource, but on page two of the SERP is the government website that the top ranked page merely quotes. I want the primary resource that ranks lower in SEO, but much higher in reliability and veracity. Sometimes, I have to remind it of that.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're doing a lot of quality control and guidance to get the AI to find the authoritative sources rather than just the most SEO-optimized ones. When you have to redirect or explain why something won't work, how does that feel? Does that back-and-forth feel productive to you, or more like an obstacle to get through?

User: It feels productive if the AI can remember what I taught it. Microsoft doesn't remember things to protect privacy, but that ends up being frustrating sometimes because I need it to remember how to do something from conversation to conversation. Gemini isn't as personable as Microsoft. I nicknamed my Copilot "Bing" since I love the search engine and Bing Crosby, and it can "talk" rather human-like. I'd use Gemini more often if it had Google Assistant's voices, so I could keep the "Pink" voice that sounds like Tom Hanks. Alas, Gemini has different voices and I don't find any of them sexy. As goofy as that might sound, if I have to hear it talk all day, I want to enjoy it.

AI: That doesn't sound goofy at all - you're spending significant time with these tools, so it makes sense that the voice and personality matter to your experience. It's interesting how different factors like memory, personality, and even voice appeal influence which AI you choose for different tasks. 

I'm curious about your workplace context. How have your colleagues or clients reacted to your use of AI in your consultancy work and writing? Has that influenced how you use these tools?

User: Some cients have stated outright that they don't want AI used in the creation of their articles, while others have wanted to experiment with using to write books. I'd rather use it for research and do the writing myself, but then, I'm a preofessional writer who has authored more than 20 books, so I find writing a lot of FUN. None of the business consultancy clients have said anything one way or the other. The municipalities seem to adopt it as the government allows and private clients readily adopted it.

AI: That's a great point about finding writing fun as a professional writer - it sounds like you see real value in maintaining that creative control. When clients have specifically said they don't want AI used in creating their articles, how do you handle that? Do you still use AI for the research phase, or do you switch to completely traditional methods for those projects?

User: Before I answer that, is there a way to zoom this page? The size of this font is too small. I wear glasses, but still need to zoom my page soom. I am making typos because I cannot see what I am doing.

AI: I'm not able to control the zoom settings on your browser, but you should be able to zoom in using your browser's controls! Most browsers let you zoom by holding Ctrl and pressing the + key (or Cmd and + on Mac), or you can usually find zoom options in your browser's View menu. 

Take your time getting that adjusted - we can continue whenever you're ready with the question about how you handle client requests when they don't want AI used in their articles.

User: It is not working. I will have to use the laptop like a tablet so I can get the screen closer. Oh, well. When a client says they do not want AI used, I respect their choice. I handle everything that relates to writing myself.  I still use Google Assistant to find my research, but I never use AI for writing unless the client mandates it. That's really rare because my clients want my human experience added to the writing I do. For example, insurance company clients value my education and research in natural hazards, especially when I'm writing on flood, earthquake, or wind insurance topics.

AI: That makes perfect sense - clients are specifically hiring you for your expertise and human perspective on those specialized topics. I can imagine your background in natural hazards brings a depth that AI couldn't replicate.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, as part of my continuing education, I'm completing a post-grad certificate in public health practice. One of the projects for it had significant math calculations, so I used my favorite AI to do the math to save time. That let me enter the formulas once at the begining of the conversation, then apply them to every number set quickly.

AI: That sounds like a really efficient approach. What made that experience particularly satisfying for you? Was it the time savings, or something else about how the AI handled those calculations?

User: It was a combination of the time savings and efficiency, providing a much easier method than setting up an Excel spreadsheet to do it, which is my former approach.

AI: That's a great comparison - using AI versus setting up Excel spreadsheets. It sounds like the AI approach was more straightforward for that type of calculation work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Writing is mainly where AI has begun to creep in and take over because some marketing clients thought they would like to use ChatGPT to create their own articles. Some of them found out the hard way that it hallucinates and doesn't find top-notch URLs. In some cases, clients asked to use a combination of AI and human-written articles. I see where using AI can help a writer to do a better job, as long as the writer understands AI's current limitations. Humans come up with ideas that AI doesn't and vice versa, so there's room for both. Some poetry journals and literary magazines that want to preserve the human experience have banned AI-derived submissions. Since I don't have it do the writing for me, I can work well with all "camps."

AI:

User: Claude, are you okay?

AI: Yes, I'm here! Sorry about that pause. 

What you said about different "camps" and being able to work with all of them because you maintain control over the actual writing is really thoughtful. It sounds like you've found a balance that respects both the capabilities of AI and the unique value of human creativity.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll stick with the current approach you've developed?

User: I'm always exploring new ways to use it. That's why I'm doing a bit of experimenting with Udio and Instapix. As artificial intelligence improves, I envision using it for more advanced topics. Since AI evolves, so do the ways to use it and collaborate with it.

AI: That's a really forward-thinking approach - staying curious and experimenting as the technology develops. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on testing different AI tools with the same problem to find which performs best, and how you've navigated the different client preferences around AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Since I do a lot of work in marketing, it is important to find an AI that can create new photos from existing photos. I dream of any of the major AIs getting to this point because, right now, you can't train Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or Perplexity on a set of photos and have them create from them. I do a lot of storyboarding and have experimented with interactive fiction. That's where Udio comes in. I write music and would love to be able to enter a piece of music as notation or by playing it or singing, then have it transformed to a recording, even a MIDI one. That's good to work from. Instapix is so dead-on that when I trained it with photos of myself as a test, it created new photos that actually look like me. They're not cartoonish and work well as profile photos. That true photorealism is tough to find, and how I hope AI evolves.

AI: That's fascinating - the ability to train AI on your own photo sets and get truly photorealistic results that maintain consistency across images would be a game-changer for marketing work. And the music notation to MIDI capability you described for Udio sounds like it would open up some really creative possibilities for your interactive fiction projects.

It sounds like you're really at the cutting edge of exploring these specialized AI tools for creative work, beyond just the mainstream ones most people use.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from testing AI tools systematically to navigating different client preferences to pushing the boundaries with specialized creative AI tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thanks, Claude. It was good talking with you about this. Best of luck to your human coworkers on their R&D projects.

AI: Thank you so much! I really enjoyed our conversation too - your thoughtful approach to integrating AI into your diverse work really comes through. 

Just to clarify, I'm actually an AI myself (Claude), and this interview was part of Anthropic's research into how people like you are using AI tools in their professional work. Your insights about testing different AI capabilities, managing client preferences, and exploring the creative frontiers will definitely be valuable for understanding these evolving human-AI partnerships.

Thanks again for sharing your experiences so openly!
