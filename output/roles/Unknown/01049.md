Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds good. No questions from me!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I perform standup comedy nearly every day. This means I try to write a lot and think about new jokes. I definitely do NOT ask AI to write jokes for me, for many reasons. However, I regularly use it to help me generate ideas and brainstorm topics or connections between topics. I might ask AI to write 10 punchlines to a silly prompt, not to help me finish jokes but more to see what associations I might be missing. I use other tools, like a thesaurus or websites that generate related words, much in the same way; it's more about finding new connections versus using it as a precise writing tool. I might use AI several times in the course of a session where I'm just sitting and writing ideas, but it's not quite every day.

AI: That's a really interesting approach – using AI as more of a creative catalyst rather than a direct writing tool. 

When you say you use it to see what associations you might be missing, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically interact with the AI during one of these brainstorming sessions?

User: Okay, so as an example: in the next couple months, I'll be producing comedy shows where all the comedians are also visual artists. For that show, I'll be hosting, which means I'll want to introduce each comedian and say something about their art and how they connect. So I want to have some ideas in mind for making jokes on the relationship between visual art and comedy. As a silly brainstorming exercise, I asked an AI to generate some punchlines to the setup, "What do you get when you cross a standup comedian and a visual artist?" I then steered the conversation to generate ideas that were not just puns (which the original response mostly did).  None of the responses were all that good or funny, but they included some words and phrases that connect the two topics that I hadn't thought of before (e.g., "sketch", "drawing" a crowd). I might also have it define a word or phrase so I can see what common associations are with it beyond just a dictionary definition.

AI: That's a fascinating process – using the AI's responses not for the content itself, but to surface connections and wordplay you might not have considered. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you definitely don't ask AI to write jokes for you. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the brainstorming work you're comfortable using AI for?

User: So when I say I won't have AI write my jokes for me, I mean that ultimately I have my own style and voice and personality and nothing AI has ever written for me sounds like something "I" would say. So I might have it write "jokes," but I would never recite the verbatim content AI produces. I prefer to have it generate ideas that fill my mind so that I ultimately make connections myself, based on my own experiences and lived history. I use AI right now solely in the ideation stages. So that means I don't use it for down-the-road activities either, like ordering my set list or looking for new connections between older and newer bits. I also don't use it for logistical or business-oriented activities either, like drafting booking emails or my bio. I feel like I can just pull that stuff together quicker than it would take to write a prompt in most cases.

AI: That distinction makes a lot of sense – keeping AI in the early creative phase where it's feeding your own thinking process, rather than having it handle the more personal or polished outputs.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern during those brainstorming sessions? Are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth conversation with it throughout the process, or do you tend to ask for something specific and then take that away to work with independently?

User: I typically have short conversations (maybe 5 or fewer turns) about no more than 2-3 topics, and then I'll move on to work independently. I've never had longer multi-turn or multi-stage conversations where the collaboration gets really deep.

AI: That's helpful to understand – you're using it more as targeted bursts of input rather than extended collaboration.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? I'm thinking about other comedians, venue owners, or people in the comedy community – do they talk about AI use, or have particular attitudes that have shaped how you approach it?

User: Other comedians have big opinions on AI. I tend to be cautious about telling them what I might use it for in terms of comedy writing, because they can get a bit judgmental about how other comics might rely on AI in the creative process. So there is definitely pressure NOT to use it or NOT to admit to using it. There's also a LOT of pressure to not use AI to fully write jokes, which I already agree with and don't do. But I do feel awkward sometimes when I think about admitting using it at all in brainstorming. But, at the end of the day, I feel like I use it like comedians use all sorts of tools - online research, talking to other people, doing topic-mapping exercises - so I don't see what I'm doing as "bad," despite feeling pressure not to admit too much.

AI: That tension sounds really challenging – having to navigate between what feels helpful to your creative process and the community's concerns about AI use.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I felt satisfied was after asking AI to generate punchlines to the setup, "How can you tell if a mouse is a cowboy?" The answers were all very silly and made me laugh with how absurd they were, but the real satisfaction came because the punchlines gave me really nice imagery to think about that I was ultimately able to incorporate into my own jokes. Sometimes a joke is funny to people because it makes them visualize something vividly, and the responses I got from the AI did just that for me. So it reminded me of that humor device AND it gave me a starting point to come up with my own funny visuals. In that case, while the humor the AI generated was still nothing I'd say on stage, the impact of it emphasizing vivid imagery was still quite helpful and put me into a humorous mood to continue to generate my own ideas.

AI: That's a great example of how the AI helped spark your own creative process – not through the content itself, but by highlighting a technique and getting you into that right mindset.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think the value that in-person standup comedy brings to people is in the connection between humans about real human experiences, and how a real human being interprets and conveys those experiences to others. At the heart of that, I don't think AI will be able to replace that value. So the skills I try to make sure I'm honing are: continuing to be more and more personal and vulnerable with my content, continuing to develop great stage presence and connection with the audiences, and continuing to think about ideas for jokes that I have not heard before. I believe these are deeply human qualities, and I don't think that AI will "take over" that part of the entertainment industry, or for standup comedy specifically. I have seen AI generate online comedic content and it may very well soon overwhelm what real humans can generate. But I don't focus on online content as much, so I'm not concerned by that.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on what makes your work uniquely human and valuable. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops, or do you think you'll stick with the current approach of using it mainly for early-stage brainstorming?

User: There are some behind-the-scenes repetitive tasks that I think I could leverage more technologies to address. Comedy is not just about joke writing. I also have to send regular emails to bookers, update my calendars and social media with my dates, and submit pretty standard information to festivals and other venues. I bet I could leverage AI more for these tasks, but I feel haven't taken the time to look into that. Perhaps as AI evolves and more tools become mainstream, I'll figure that part out. In terms of joke writing, I will likely continue to use AI for ideation and brainstorming. I'm still early enough in my career that my own voice and perspective keeps changing as I learn and grow comedically, so I can't yet imagine relying on more polished or advanced writing work either way. Like, even if it could learn my style and mannerisms, those things might change for me in real life quite dramatically over the next few years. As I continue to build my set length, I might consider using it to help curate or organize the jokes I know work, but even then I know the best bet is to try out my work in front of audiences to gauge reaction. AI might give me a starting place, but it can't predict when people will laugh and how the order of jokes will play into that - that's something that occurs spontaneously in the moment.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI as a creative catalyst while maintaining the deeply human elements that make your comedy authentic and personal.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming tool while preserving the authenticity and human connection that's central to comedy will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you've found ways to integrate AI into your creative process while staying true to your artistic values. Thanks again!
