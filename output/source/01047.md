Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions for now. We can start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my typical workday, as an AI researcher, the key tasks I conduct are:
* Reading (scientific papers, books, websites, etc.)
* Writing (notes, scientific papers, emails, etc.)
* Coding (mainly prototyping)

I use AI assistants in all these activities. While reading, I use AI to ask questions and clarify my doubts. While writing, I use AI to improve my text. While coding, I use AI to generate code, fix bugs, or understand existing code.

More practically, I have:
* A browser window with several AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Gemini, etc.)
* Two AI coding assistants integrated in my developoment environment, specifically in Neovim, as plugins. The plugins are CodeCompanion and Avante. 
* An AI assistant integrated in the terminal. The tool is called aichat.

AI: That's a really comprehensive setup you've described. It sounds like AI is deeply integrated across your entire workflow.

When you're using AI for these different activities - reading, writing, and coding - can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like? For instance, when you're reading a scientific paper and have questions, how do you typically engage with the AI to clarify your doubts?

User: If I'm reading a paper and I have questions/doubts about it, I typically upload the PDF to the AI chatbot and ask the question. The question is typically very short and direct. For instance, I might copy the excerpt that I triggered the doubt and express my doubt.  

Then, depending on the response, I might have follow-up questions or topics that I don't know. In case of follow-up questions on the paper, I keep chatting in the same chat. Otherwise, if I need to ask kind of separate question (e.g., a related topic), I might use a different AI chatbot so that I don't clutter my original chat about the paper.

AI: That's interesting how you organize your conversations - keeping the paper discussion focused in one chat and branching out to other chatbots for related topics.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: For very practical tasks such as coding, I want to keep control on everything I do. So, for me AI is an assistant that can help me do low-level tasks quicker and more directly than I would if I had to do it on my own (Googling -> finding what I need -> understanding -> applying to my use case). 

What I don't like to do is to completely delegate coding tasks to AI. I'm not a vibe-coder. I think a vibe-coded codebase is unmaintainable. It could have bugs you don't know and see. Since I code experiments producing scientific results that will be published, I prefer to keep full control on what I do.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI as an assistant for efficiency while maintaining full control over the actual implementation. The term "vibe-coder" is particularly striking.

When you use AI for coding assistance in the way you described - helping with those low-level tasks - could you describe what that interaction typically looks like? How do you engage with your coding assistants to get that targeted help while maintaining control?

User: For coding I use AI coding assistants in two main modes:
* Code completion: I get completion hints while typing, which I can accept or not.
* Chat: I can chat about the code, let AI explain a piece of code, or brainstorm. This is similar to how I use web-based AI chatbots in the browser, but the advantage is that I can easily share the necessary context (code).

So, I always use code completion, and I find it very very useful. About the chat, I use it on-demand when I have some question or I need to generate some code skeleton (e.g., a new class).

AI: It sounds like you have a really clear system for how you interact with AI across different modes - the always-on completion versus the deliberate chat interactions when you need specific help.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with how others around you are using these tools?

User: Yes, most of my colleagues use AI in a similar way, perhaps in a less structured approach and with different tools. I'm quite structured and I thought thoroughly about my workflow. Also, I like open-source and tinkering. For example, I use Neovim while most of my colleagues use VS Code.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like there's a shared approach among your colleagues, but you've put more deliberate thought into optimizing your specific setup.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the most satisfying experience was when I managed to describe exactly the code changes I wanted, and the AI agent updated it perfectly. 

The most annoying one, instead, is for sure related to writing my thesis. I was asking the AI to rephrase some parts, but it took many iterations to get a satisfying version.

AI: Those two experiences really highlight the contrast - the precision and efficiency when the AI understood your coding request perfectly versus the back-and-forth struggle with the thesis writing.

When you were working on rephrasing parts of your thesis and it took many iterations, what do you think was making that process so challenging? Was it the AI not understanding what you wanted, or something else about that particular task?

User: I think the key problem was that I wanted the output with specific constraints and I wasn't expressing them exactly (e.g., how long, which kind of words to use, the tone, etc.). Now that I think about it, having some knobs to tune the output specific to writing would have helped.

I was quite frustrated but I think it would have been better to spend more time crafting a better prompt instead of iterating over and over.

AI: That's a really insightful reflection - recognizing that the issue was more about the specificity of your constraints rather than the AI's capability itself.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I reasoned about that extensively in the last period. I really like coding and I was considering a slight career shift to software engineering. However, since I think AI is making enormous progress in that area, I believe it is better in the long-term to stay in research.

AI: That's a significant career consideration - weighing your personal interests against where you see AI's trajectory heading.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use these tools, or do you think your current approach will remain fairly stable?

User: I think my workflow and tools will evolve and change very quickly. We are seeing so much progress in AI tools, so I think maintaining flexibility is key in this period. I believe AI will be integrated in more and more tools. Most tools will probably be redesigned around AI completely, like it already happened with code editors like Cursor.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining control while leveraging AI's efficiency, and your strategic thinking about career paths in light of AI's progress.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, nothing more. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that balance between AI assistance and personal control, along with your thoughtful approach to workflow optimization, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the satisfying and frustrating moments - that kind of honest feedback is exactly what helps us understand the real-world experience of working with AI tools.

Have a great rest of your day!
