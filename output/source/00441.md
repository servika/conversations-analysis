Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No we can begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically only use AI to automate any sort of low-risk mundane task I need to do. Like transferring data from one format to another that doesn't have an easy automatic conversion, or listing out events from calendars, or writing skeletons for code but not any actual functional code itself.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned you use AI for code skeletons but not functional code itself. What makes you draw that line there?

User: I find it to be more time efficient for myself to write the code and fully understand what is happening so if there is a problem debugging will be much easier. However if I have AI write the code, then I have to spend extra time understanding what is actually being done and I do not possess the level of trust required to insert this into my programs.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the debugging and trust aspects seem really important to your decision-making. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the data transfers and calendar listings you mentioned?

User: It's more of just a balance of time. If AI can handle it and it will take me significant time to do, I will try to outsource this to AI. But if it is something I feel AI could handle, but won't take very long, I'll just do it myself to limit any possibility it is done incorrectly.

AI: So time investment seems to be a key factor in your decision-making process. 

When you do use AI for those higher time-investment tasks like data transfers, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to delegate the complete task for it to handle independently?

User: It depends on the complexity of the task. It is is a multi-staged process, as in part two depends on data from part one, I will collaborate and help it walk through the process one part at a time to ensure that if there is an issue, it is caught in the middle of the process and corrected instead of just getting an incorrect end-product and having no idea what went wrong. If it is a relatively straightforward process, I will allow the AI to do it all at once.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - breaking down complex, multi-staged processes to catch issues early. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with how others around you are using these tools?

User: I've noticed that my older more experienced colleagues are very reluctant to use AI and do not trust the output at all. However younger less experienced colleagues I find over-rely on it and do not properly examine the code and it causes them more issues than it helps them, as their tasks are typically pretty easy anyway. So the juxtaposition of those two types of colleagues with me somewhere in the middle, a healthy skepticism but openness to using it.

AI: That generational divide you're describing is really fascinating - you seem to have found a middle ground between complete avoidance and over-reliance.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I find myself being overly frustrated when the AI cannot understand my request. I am never as annoyed if the AI gives me the wrong output but clearly understands the goal. However if it struggles even understanding the goal of my request it becomes very very frustrating.

AI: That distinction is really telling - it sounds like communication breakdown is more frustrating than execution errors. When the AI doesn't understand your goal, what do you typically find yourself doing in those moments?

User: Typically in those scenarios I am trying to achieve something, that is not a well defined cookie cutter problem. Like if I am playing with some hobby electronics with say an arduino and breadboard and I have an idea to try a weird combination of things.. it will often struggle to understand what I mean.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those creative, experimental scenarios where you're combining things in novel ways would be much harder for AI to grasp than standard problems.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No this is not something I consider at all. I'm pretty confident in my ability to learn new things so even if I do get pushed out of a field by AI I could absolutely just pivot into something else without much worry.

AI: That's a really confident perspective on adaptability. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use these tools as they improve or as your own experience with them grows?

User: I absolutely think that part of growing and being open-minded at work would encompass efficient use of the tools at my disposal. If AI were to improve I would feel more confident using it for more involved tasks that otherwise I would just do myself.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on finding that middle ground between the over-reliance and complete avoidance you see in your colleagues, and how you break down complex tasks to collaborate step-by-step.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between trust and efficiency, and how you navigate AI collaboration based on task complexity, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
