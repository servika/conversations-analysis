Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No go ahead

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use AI to quickly write base scripts for use in IT Infrastructure, the next most important thing I use it for is researching best practices for deployments like in Azure

AI: That's really helpful - so you're using it both for hands-on coding and for research. 

When you say "base scripts," can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Are you starting completely from scratch with AI, or do you come to it with specific requirements already mapped out?

User: I might have a task I need to complete, like generate a report of license usage on Office 365 filtered by an organizational unit in the company, and then I might need it to change/adjust licenses on criteria.  Usually it does not build out what I need fully, but gets me 95% of the way there and then I can make my own adjustments to finish it out

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - getting that 95% foundation and then customizing it yourself. 

Tell me more about those final adjustments you make. What kinds of things does the AI typically miss or get wrong that you need to fix?

User: Usually it's out of date information on powershell and graph calls.  It might have recommended a deprecated feature that is no longer in use

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the tech stack moves so quickly. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: AI could probably increase speed of resolution on outages/errors, but I have enough experience that I usually know when something breaks what it is.  But I'm also worried AI takes me down the wrong rabbit hole when fixing something difficult

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - trusting your instincts during critical moments versus the risk of being led astray. 

Can you tell me more about that "wrong rabbit hole" concern? Have you had an experience where that actually happened, or is it more of a worry based on what you've observed?

User: Well say I have an issue with mail delivery, I have a multi tiered environment where mail flow hits proofpoint spam filters, then is delivered to exchange 365.  If I just typed in "my users can't receive email", and there's actually a problem with public DNS, it would probably steer towards common 365 issues or proofpoint issues

AI: That's a perfect example - you need to diagnose systematically through your specific architecture, but AI might jump to generic solutions without understanding your environment's complexity.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I always collaborate with it, I don't trust it to handle tasks independently, and even if I did I'd still have to take time to verify correctness

AI: That verification step makes total sense given the stakes in your role. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or do you see different approaches?

User: AI is a tool in your toolset you need to have, not using or understanding the way it can be useful can be seen as almost a scarlet letter in IT.

AI: That's a really striking way to put it - a scarlet letter. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It's most frustrating when it uses a deprecated version, and then I ultimately have to research the correct call myself, and feed the website page to the AI so it acknowledges what is correct and rebuilds the functioning script

AI: So you end up doing the research work anyway, plus the extra step of teaching the AI what's current - that sounds like it can actually slow you down in those moments.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's always important to maintain your skillset, if your favorite AI model breaks or you have no internet, you need to rely on yourself

AI: That's a really practical perspective - maintaining that self-reliance as a backup.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As I stated, it's a tool in my toolbelt, but it needs to be held at an arm's length.  If you use it too much it becomes a crutch and harms you down the line.

AI: You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that balance between leveraging AI as a necessary tool while maintaining healthy skepticism and your own expertise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I don't believe so

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance - using AI as a necessary tool while keeping it "at arm's length" and maintaining your own skills - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your workflow and being so candid about both the benefits and the frustrations. Have a great rest of your day!
