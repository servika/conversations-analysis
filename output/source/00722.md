Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good Claude, I'm ready when you are!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I suppose at a basic level, I see first hand how AI can be utilized to carry out certain tasks. I work as QA Tester for a gambling company and we use automation to carry out some of the tests. I know AI is more complex and broad in it's capabilities than running automation scripts but that is my experience with it. The gaming industry is fast moving, with regulations updates constantly changing, new software being introduced to make the gaming experience faster and smoother for customers so there is a lot of coding constantly taking place. I don't see this side of the business but I can see how AI could be used to write code quicker in these areas.

AI: That's really interesting - you're seeing AI from both the testing automation side and recognizing its potential in the development side of things. 

When you mention the automation scripts that you work with for testing, how hands-on are you with those? Are you setting them up, monitoring them, or more on the receiving end of the results they produce?

User: Automation of certain tests came into the company about a year and a half ago. Initially I worked with the coders to confirm the steps and expected outcomes. I saw the amount of data the coders needed in order to do a simple task like placing a single bet. The process was long but now a year and a half later these automation scripts run in the background every cycle and we only need to manually step in if there is an issue, which there hasn't been in a long time. Now, it's just the managers really that review the test completion reports which I imagine are at 100%.

AI: So you were part of that initial setup process - that's a unique perspective on how AI automation gets integrated into workflows. 

Tell me more about what that transition felt like for you personally. When those automation scripts started handling tests that you used to do manually, how did that change your day-to-day work experience?

User: I honestly felt like I was helping write the code to take over my job and replace me lol, but I soon realized that the automation process was limited, and could only carry out certain tests. As mentioned earlier, regulations are constantly being introduced to the industry so new enhancements have to be made to the processes. As these are brand new processes, it's quicker and easier to run these types of tests manually. I'm not overly familiar with coding but I do know it can take a while to get it right, and in terms of regulations for this industry there are deadline dates to have the new processes in place, so it makes more sense to run these tests manually.

AI: That's such a candid way to put it - "helping write the code to take over my job!" But it sounds like you discovered there's a natural division between what works well for automation versus what needs that human touch.

When you're doing those manual tests for new regulatory processes, what is it about that work that makes it quicker and easier for you to handle rather than trying to automate it?

User: The developers write the code and release it into the UAT environment for me to test. Once I read the document of the enhancement it will usually take me few clicks here and there to complete a test. Now to automate that same test, a coder would have to work alongside me, write the code, trial it, fix any issues, retest again and repeat until it completed the test successfully. It seems like overkill in a situation like this.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the overhead of creating the automation can outweigh the benefit, especially when you can validate something in just a few clicks. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: For regression testing I'm all for automation, we have a suite of about 5,000 regression tests and only about 20% of them are automated. I'd like to see that number increase. But when it comes to new enhancements, I think it's more beneficial to test these manually, not only for the reasons stated earlier but it's good to see the process working in real time. Another part of our testing process is giving the business stakeholders a walk through of the new enhancement in action. I don't think this can be mimicked by AI or at least it would take too long to code the process.

AI: That walkthrough with business stakeholders is a really important point - there's a human element there that goes beyond just running the test. 

When you're doing those walkthroughs, what's happening in those interactions that makes your direct involvement valuable? What are you picking up on or providing that you don't think could be replicated?

User: I think the biggest value is experiencing it from a customer's point of view. By me doing the test I can go through the exact same steps as the customer would. We have experienced on many occasions where the idea sounds good on paper but when you actually test it in the test environment it doesn't feel right, it does what it's supposed to, but it could be better. The stakeholders are great at noticing things like that. I thin when some new change comes on the scene it's better to test it manually first, and then when it's perfect according to the stakeholders experience it can be moved into the regression test pack and be automated at some point in the future.

AI: That's a great insight - you're essentially the bridge between the technical implementation and the actual customer experience. The stakeholders are catching those "it works but doesn't feel right" moments that might slip through pure automation.

When you use AI or automation for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to set it up to handle complete tasks independently?

User: My input is generally at the beginning of the process when the coders are gathering the data points, for example I'd confirm to the coders that this button is to clicked first, a value entered next, user cannot click this button etc. Now that the automation team have a lot of these processes mapped out, I personally don't see the automation in action, it runs in the background. I do look at the end reports just to see how things are progressing.

AI: So you're more in a setup and monitoring role rather than actively collaborating with the automation once it's running. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI or automation in your work? Has there been encouragement, resistance, or something else from the people around you?

User: Yea once it's running I'm totally hands off. At first we thought there might be job cuts when the automation of the regression test scripts got to 100% but I don't think it will ever reach 100% and there will always be a need for manual testers. For me this was a great realization as it's not nice to think you could lose your job at some stage. Initial resistance for sure but now it's being used as an effective tool and the test team are happy with it.

AI: That initial worry about job security is so understandable, and it sounds like the reality turned out quite different from those early fears.

Can you share a time when using automation at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've always had a fear of automation as I'm a manual tester so I'd always see it as the competition but when I worked with the automation coders I found a new appreciation for it. It's a tough job, especially in the dynamic environment that is the gaming industry. Our company has offered beginning workshop classes for automation so there are opportunities now that it has arrived on the scene. That gives me more satisfaction with the job rather than automation itself if that makes sense.

AI: That absolutely makes sense - it sounds like automation went from being this threatening force to actually opening up new learning opportunities and career paths for you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where automation could potentially take over more tasks? Is this something you actively consider or plan for?

User: If it came to a point where I thought my job was at risk I would definitely consider pursuing courses on automation coding. At the minute it doesn't appear to be like that, I work mostly with the new enhancements so I get to manually test new processes mostly.

AI: That's a practical approach - keeping an eye on the landscape but not feeling immediate pressure to pivot. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI or automation at work evolving? Where do you see things heading?

User: I do know our coders check code with AI applications to ensure it has everything in check before releasing to me. It's not perfect but it's pretty good and I can only see it being used more and more. The industry is very computer based so it has to see the advantage of using AI. I think there could be a nice balance of AI and automation, especially in the coding side of things.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with automation and AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you went from seeing automation as competition to recognizing it as a tool that actually opened up new opportunities, and your point about being the bridge between technical implementation and the customer experience.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI or automation in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: One area I would like to see it used more is around fraud detection. I'm not too familiar with my company's policies on this and how much they use AI in this regard, but I think that is an area in general that could be run completely by AI.

AI: That's a really insightful addition - fraud detection does seem like a natural fit for AI given the pattern recognition capabilities and the need for continuous monitoring.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution from initial resistance to finding that balance between human expertise and automation, especially in that fast-moving regulatory environment, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you and have a nice day!

AI: Thank you so much, and you have a wonderful day as well! I really appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences with me.
