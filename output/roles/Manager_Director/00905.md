Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No I'm good to begin, thanks

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in marketing and have a team I work with. We typically create direct response marketing campaigns and work with a multitude of clients from various industries ranging from insurance to casinos. AI usage is typically creating new ad creatives including headlines and descriptions. It is also used to come up with ideas for images which make up a large part of the ad and what the user is drawn to. Aside from creative elements, it is used to analyse data on the performance of the ads it comes up with, and how they compare to ads created in-house by our staff. It then uses this information to improve and provide reasoning/listen to reasoning as to why those creatives worked/did not work.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow you've described. It sounds like AI is deeply integrated into multiple stages of your campaign development process.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do enjoy creating ads, however enjoyment doesn't factor into it as if data shows one ad works better than another, then we keep the winning ad. So, although I prefer handling the ads, I'm open to collaboration with AI. Things like daily menial tasks like collecting the previous days ad spend and revenue from various sources I handle myself. AI would probably be able to do this if we set it up correctly, however as these figures pass through to our accounting/bookkeeping team, we prefer it to be handled by humans. I would be more open to letting AI do this, but as clients come and go at a rapid pace, there are various platforms to pull this data from (mainly revenue data), so setting up AI to work with a clients platform which may not be around in a month could be troublesome

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the temporary nature of client relationships and the accounting sensitivity really shapes those decisions.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Definitely collaboration. Most industries have rules and regulations which means ads can't cross certain boundaries. For example, one of longstanding clients is a life insurance company. We do use emotion in our ads to gain clients, however there is a line that cannot be crossed, or certain things we cannot say. Same goes for clients which operate online casinos, there is a LOT of regulation around what can be said, and this varies country to country. Therefore I prefer to collaborate with AI and correct it when it provides an ad creative which may be against any rules it may not be privy to

AI: That's a really insightful point about the regulatory complexities. It sounds like your industry knowledge becomes crucial in guiding the AI away from potential compliance issues.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Most of our workplace are either data focused or creative focused. As a marketing director I have to have knowledge across both aspects. The whole team are open to using AI and do utilise it well, although it does vary individual to individual. Some may prefer AI to provide a direct answer e.g. "write an ad for xyz". Others may prefer to be provided with ideas such as "why do people take out life insurance" and use their skills to create ads based on the results. The same goes with the data side, some may want an answer to a set of data, some may want the raw data and analyse themselves. I can say the overall view of AI in our workplace is positive and a feeling of collaboration rather than competition.

AI: It's interesting how different team members have developed their own approaches - some wanting direct outputs versus others preferring AI as more of a brainstorming partner.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustration is not particularly a feeling I have when working with AI on projects as I get answers directly and utilise data to see if the ads work or not, even if I think the ads are poor as this sometimes translates to profitability. So I think a feeling of satisfaction is more suitable and one which stands out to me is when we first adopted AI into our company and certain individuals (higher ups at the time) were not so sure about doing so but I did push and emphasise that the data is all that matters, we'll test every ad that we come up with and every ad that AI comes up with. In the end AI outperformed human ads by a few percent but it showed the power of AI, and this was before the new features became available in modern AI apps.

AI: That's a great example of letting the data speak for itself to drive adoption. It sounds like that early validation was important for getting organizational buy-in.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Fortunately I have been in marketing/advertising for around 15+ years now, and have a good understanding of how companies work as a whole including the data side, creative side, accounting side, client side, and many other aspects which may not be fully able to be replaced by AI. But some of these skills could be taken over by AI. Ad creatives and just general ad ideas is an area which AI could take over, but it would need some collaboration with humans. Data analysis could be another aspect, but AI would need a lot of context when analysing the data. I do not consider AI "taking over", as I view it more complementary to skills and more of a collaboration

AI: That collaborative mindset is really striking - it sounds like you see AI as enhancing rather than replacing your expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: There have been a few colleagues who have looked at using AI for non creative/data work, such as invoice management or other daily tasks. They have more of a say on these sorts of tasks, so I'm sure they will be implemented into the company at some point. Directly related to my role and marketing in general, I can see AI just getting better at creating ads including images. The images part of the ad is most interesting. Initially the images which AI came up with did not outperform our internal images, however month by month it is improving and that is an aspect of our work with AI which could evolve

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how data-driven decision making has helped your organization embrace AI collaboration, and how you view it as complementary rather than competitive.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks, take care

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach to AI in marketing, especially around regulatory compliance and data-driven validation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Take care!
