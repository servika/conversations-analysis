Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Since I am operating my own business as a mobile notary loan signing agent (estate planning, apostilles, etc), I use AI a lot to generate ideas for content for social media, blog posts, etc

AI: That's interesting - using AI for content creation to support your notary business. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're working on social media content or blog posts, what does that typically look like from start to finish?

User: First I would look for interesting topics. For example, I'm really interested in notary history right now, and I might ask if there were any famous notaries in the past who either contributed greatly to further the profession or who influenced history significantly

AI: That sounds like a fascinating angle for content. 

What happens next once you get those initial ideas or historical information from AI? How do you take it from there to create the final content that goes out to your audience?

User: I ask it for ideas to be used in a blog post based on the info that was found.  I plan on rewriting the blog post for the most part, as well as making sure that the "facts" listed there are, indeed, facts.

AI: So you're doing your own fact-checking and rewriting - that's a thoughtful approach. 

What drives that decision to rewrite most of it rather than using the AI-generated content more directly? What are you looking to change or add when you do that rewriting?

User: I build out some sections more, I also incorporate some marketing where appropriate.  I also really don't want it to sound like it's written by AI, I want my own style to be evident.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining your authentic voice while building out the content strategically.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your business that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to interact with my clients on my website myself rather than through AI chat.  AI can get a lot of the quirky NC laws wrong, and I don't want my potential customers to feel like I should be able to do something when in actuality it's not legal in NC.

AI: That's a really important distinction - protecting both your clients and your professional standing by handling those direct interactions yourself.

When you do use AI for work tasks like content creation, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a task and then take what it gives you to work with independently?

User: I do go back and forth quite a bit, especially using AI for image generation as most images found online have watermarks or are behind a pay wall. I have also used AI to generate ideas for tables that I convert into spreadsheets for data, expenses, customer contact info, etc

AI: Interesting - so you're using that collaborative back-and-forth approach across different types of tasks, from images to data organization.

How have your colleagues or others in the notary field influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or approaches in your professional community?

User: I do know a lot of people in the notary industry use AI to get ideas for blog content on their websites, as well as for outlines of their blog posts. Also for professional headshots on sites such as LinkedIn, etc. I have also used it for ideas on better content for sections of my LinkedIn profile

AI: It sounds like there's pretty broad adoption in your industry for these creative and professional presentation tasks.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Image generation tends to be very quirky, especially when AI tries to incorporate text. Regardless of how the rest of the image is oriented, the AI always seems to make the text "face me" like I was the reader instead of, say, the person behind the desk. It seems to not understand what I want. Or things that AI spells correctly all of the time suddenly become gibberish in the image. Usually have to solve by asking AI not to use any "words" in the image, unless by some miracle the perspective and spelling are both correct

AI: That's a really specific and frustrating example - the AI missing those spatial and contextual details that seem obvious to you. It sounds like you've developed some workarounds though.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your work?

User: Given that I am in a service type position, going directly to the customer, it's not as likely that AI would take over a lot of what I am doing. I am also constantly learning new skills, currently brushing up HTML and learning Python, Javascript, SQL, etc. Considering a few years ago I was a chemical engineer in quality management in the plastics industry, learning is something that I'm used to always doing.  When you're in a field that could be "tech" or have advances, you always need to keep up with them.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - staying adaptable and continuously learning across different fields. Your transition from chemical engineering to running a notary business definitely shows that adaptability in action.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see it fitting into your business as the technology continues to develop?

User: I'm constantly looking for new ways to incorporate AI into my work.  At this point, I keep finding so many errors, I don't see it taking over from me anytime soon in terms of content creation, etc. I believe firmly in work smarter, not harder, and I feel like AI should be able to help me significantly with marketing, generating new leads, etc.

AI: That's a great perspective - leveraging AI as a tool to work smarter while recognizing its current limitations.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining your authentic voice in content creation while still using AI strategically, and how you've adapted AI use based on the specific requirements of serving clients directly.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we've covered the main topics I have had as well!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with professional authenticity, the importance of direct client relationships, and your continuous learning approach will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how someone running their own service business navigates these tools thoughtfully. Have a great rest of your day!
