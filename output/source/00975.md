Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Go ahead.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I really don't use it too often. But sometimes I find it useful when I need to create learning or marketing material. Usually, I'll have an idea, but feel a little overwhelmed as to what information to include and that sort of thing. Then I might use AI to help me.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI helps you when you're facing that initial hurdle of organizing your thoughts. 

When you say you use it for learning or marketing material, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you go from feeling overwhelmed to actually working with the AI?

User: For example, I might want to create an information sheet that I can pass out when I am marketing my business at a small market. I have a general idea of what I want, but I have so many directions that I can take, so I might start a conversation with an AI to get ideas. Then as I pick ideas, I might ask for definitions or specific examples of things. I still want to be doing the writing so that the material represents my perspective, but I can save time on both crystallizing the ideas and researching the minute details with AI.

AI: That's a really clear example, thank you. It sounds like you're using AI as a brainstorming partner and research assistant while keeping the actual writing and your voice in your own hands.

I'm curious about that distinction you made - you mentioned wanting the material to represent your perspective. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are lots of tasks that I like to keep to myself, like bookkeeping. I enjoy creating systems for myself and doing things efficiently, and I don't want to lose touch with important details of my business. It's similar with the writing. I could just ask AI to write me a sheet, but I find that the struggle of writing it myself actually leads me to better ideas and a better understanding of myself and my work. So partly, it may be a trust thing at this point, and partly, the tasks help me be a better representative of my own work.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - the idea that the struggle itself has value and leads to better understanding. It sounds like you see certain tasks as opportunities for self-discovery and skill development.

When you do use AI for those brainstorming and research tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth conversation with it throughout the process, or do you tend to ask for specific pieces of information and then go work on your own?

User: A bit of back and forth. First, I might use AI to get an idea of what I'm going to write, then I start writing and go back to the AI if I feel caught between two choices, need a definition, or want a couple of ideas to get me back into the writing.

AI: That sounds like a really fluid workflow - using AI as a touchstone you can return to when you hit specific roadblocks while keeping the main creative process in your own hands.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself adjusting how you approach it based on what others around you are doing?

User: I'm a solopreneur, so I don't have anyone to compare myself to. I haven't worked in an office since before AI was available. I used to be a computer programmer and now I'm a mental health therapist, so I have a rather different perspective than others in my field. I'm slow to adopt new technology because I'm a creature of habit, but never afraid of it. I also work with a lot of clients who have objections to AI, so I don't want to bring it too obviously into the client-facing side of my work.

AI: That's really insightful - being a solopreneur gives you complete autonomy over how you integrate these tools, but your clients' perspectives still influence your choices. Your background as a programmer is interesting too.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes I get frustrated when the ideas I get don't quite match what I'm looking for. That's a felt sense for me. But it doesn't surprise me because I feel that way with people too. I don't fully embrace mainstream perspectives of mental health, so getting information about standard views and perspectives isn't what I want.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation - recognizing that the mismatch isn't necessarily an AI problem, but more about finding perspectives that align with your particular approach to mental health work.

It sounds like you have a pretty non-mainstream perspective in your field. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given your programming background and understanding of how technology evolves?

User: What do you mean by "maintaining my skills?" Maybe you're talking about me keeping control of certain aspects of my business? Yes, I can imagine myself eventually incorporating AI into more of my work. Part of the problem is that I'm slow to change, even if I know that something might benefit me. I need time to test things and find what works for me, but my life has been pretty hectic over the last year or two, which hasn't left me much time for experimentation or really working on my business at all. If I got into the habit of using AI more, I would keep using it more. There's an initial hurdle that makes it tougher.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're describing that classic challenge of needing time to experiment and build new habits when you're already stretched thin.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? What would need to happen for you to get over that initial hurdle and incorporate it more into your routine?

User: Well, even this conversation is helping. It's forcing me to take time and think about the ways I could get AI work for me without necessarily sacrificing creative or detailed control. Either way, I'm sure I will need to make improvements to my business at some point and I'll be forced into making changes that will likely include AI. I say "forced," but I don't necessarily mean it in a negative sense; just that I'll get pushed over my own hurdles. I don't know if I can point to anything specific that would help. I tend to just trust that life will move me to the right changes at the right time.

AI: That's such an interesting way to think about change - trusting in that natural timing rather than forcing yourself over the hurdles. And it's great to hear that even just talking through it is helping you see possibilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the struggle of doing certain tasks yourself leads to better understanding and ideas - that's a really nuanced view of where AI fits and where it doesn't.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that covers things pretty well. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI as a tool while maintaining the aspects of work that drive your own growth and understanding will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you continue to find that natural timing you mentioned for incorporating these tools in ways that work for you. Take care!
