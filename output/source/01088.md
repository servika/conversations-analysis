Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have any questions. We can begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: A typical workday for me is elementary instruction from 9-12 and then in the evening I have students come for Spanish tutoring. I use it to come up with lesson plan ideas for teaching an advanced Spanish student and for creating dialogs, worksheets, quizzes, reading comprehensions,etc.  When teaching my younger kids, I use it for learning background information before instruction. I also use it for finding links to songs I can use.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helps you with both preparation and content creation across different age groups. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for background research with your younger students. What does that process look like for you?

User: Well, they are learning from a Classical curriculum which means there is a lot of memory work to learn. These are songs or chants about topics way above their grade level. For example, the four year olds learn in week one about King Charlamagne, William the conqueror, the timeline of the Age of Ancient Empires up to and including the Creation to Circa 450 A.D., the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476AD, the names of the European Waters, the multiplication tables for 2, The 8 parts of speech, and the first conjugation present tense endings in Latin. None of this makes sense to a four year old when just a stand alone song/chant so I use AI to provide me with background knowledge of the history, time period, etc. to understand and also to look up videos that they would comprehend, ideas for crafts, pictures to use--anything that would help me (because I was never trained in this curriculum) and them to have a bigger picture of what they are learning.  The point is that some of this sinks in and is reactivated later when they go over it again the following years.

AI: That's fascinating - so you're essentially using AI as your research assistant to bridge the gap between this very advanced classical content and what four-year-olds can actually grasp and engage with.

When you're doing this kind of background research, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you ask it one big question about a topic like King Charlemagne, or do you find yourself going back and forth with follow-up questions to dig deeper?

User: Both actually. I probably start with a big question and when this is understood, more questions pop into my mind and I ask those.

AI: That makes sense - sounds like a natural conversation flow develops as you learn more.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Sometimes. For example, when creating test questions for my older students, I always have to revise the format and organization so many times when using AI that I end up asking AI for help with generating test questions but then I just pick and choose and plug them in myself. It seems to have difficulty knowing that all the answers shouldn't be the same letter (in multiple choice questions) or that the difficulty level should be higher in other questions. One time I asked for a long test and it repeated the same 5 questions over and over again in the document.

AI: That's a really concrete example - it sounds like AI gives you good raw material for test questions, but you've learned that the final assembly and quality control is something you handle better yourself.

When you do use AI successfully - like for creating those dialogs or worksheets you mentioned earlier - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it a complete request and let it handle it independently?

User: Most of the time I can give it a complete request and it handles it well, especially if I give it very specific criteria. For example yesterday I provided it with a sample diaglogue/email and a series of comprehension questions. I asked it to create three more sample dialogues/emails and questions for each (in Spanish). I asked for strategies, useful connectors and time saving techniques, to help a student who is trying to speed up her response time in written essays for an upcoming AP test.

AI: It sounds like you've developed a knack for giving AI detailed, specific instructions that lead to successful outcomes. That Spanish dialogue example shows you really know how to set it up for success.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other teachers using it similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: The teachers I am around are actually against using AI. They hate that their students use it and it sours them against it. I find it to be a valuable time saving tool and could be used in the classroom with the students to learn.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're kind of going against the grain in your environment. It sounds like you see potential that your colleagues might be missing.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I once had students use AI to ask it questions about what we were learning (subjunctive present tense). I provided some sample questions like "What is a main clause trigger" "Why is it called a trigger", "When do I use the subjunctive?" "Quiz me on the subjunctive"to get them started. Most students claimed that they learned more than they expected. They had the ability to ask questions without the entire class listening to them ask and getting embarrassed. They could ask multiple questions and dig deeper. It was a good experience.

AI: That sounds like a really successful experience - giving students that private space to ask questions and explore at their own pace. It's interesting that you found a way to use AI as a learning partner rather than just a content generator.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Sometimes. But Im not sure what I think about that yet. Maybe it frees me to do other things in the same field. I don't think AI can take over everything. People are still needed.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - the idea that it might free you up for other aspects of your work rather than replace you entirely.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: Probably for different things. Not sure yet.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning partner for students - that example of them asking questions about the subjunctive without embarrassment really stood out to me as a creative way to enhance learning.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Just that I love using AI to learn, teach and create. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a research tool for curriculum preparation and as a learning partner for students will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes - like those Spanish dialogues and the subjunctive learning session - and the challenges you've encountered with things like test formatting. Your perspective as someone pioneering AI use in an environment where colleagues are more skeptical adds valuable depth to our understanding.

Thanks again for participating in this research. Take care!
