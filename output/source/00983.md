Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great, thanks! No questions, please proceed.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Being a copywriter for a Graphic Design and Branding firm, I typically use AI for help with ideation and brainstorming tasks for messaging, as well as for refining copy after I write it.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI at both ends of your creative process. 

Can you walk me through what that ideation and brainstorming looks like? How do you typically approach AI when you're in that initial creative phase?

User: Sure! When I'm using for ideation/brainstorming, I approach using AI as I would if I was in an in-person brainstorming session. I will give the model all the pertinent information I have about the task at hand. Often, this is for messaging around a certain product or even ideas for ways to structure poetry in some cases, as our client list is diverse. I will write out an extensive synopsis of what I'm trying to accomplish with the model, for example saying "let's come up with some ideas for engaging, creative headlines and subheadlines for a product that does XXX. I'll then include a product description that I've previously written as well as some examples that I came with on my own to start.

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative approach - treating AI like a brainstorming partner rather than just a tool. 

When you mention including examples you've come up with on your own to start, what happens next in that conversation? How does the AI typically respond, and how do you build on what it gives you?

User: I like giving examples that I've written on my own for several reasons. Number 1, it helps keep my mind engaged and helps to humanize the work I'm doing. Number 2, I've found that it helps steer the AI models more in the direction that that I'm looking to go in vs. it just going off on its own. When I send my own examples, what happens next is that the model typically mirrors the structure, cadence and stylistic feel that I've given it with other examples.

AI: That's a thoughtful strategy - using your own work to guide the direction while keeping yourself actively engaged in the process.

You mentioned that including your own examples helps "humanize the work" you're doing. Can you tell me more about what that means to you?

User: Being in a creative field, I feel it's very important to not just rely on Artificial Intelligence for my work. As helpful and incredible as AI is, it has not had the experiences and real-life feelings that a person has. It's never actually used a product and can't truly understand what's it's like to shopping for one. By starting with original thoughts and using AI to refine and make them better, I feel it leads my work to be more grounded and "soulful" for lack of a better word. Without infusing my work with that, I feel that it comes out more rigid and emotionless. As much as AI tries, in writing you can often tell if it's strictly artificially generated.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective on maintaining that human element in your creative work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle all rough drafts of what I'm writing on my own, before engaging AI. I could absolutely do the opposite and plug in some criteria, let the model generate copy and then revise and it would probably go much quicker. However, I feel that it's necessary to maintain creative integrity for myself and my clients and keep that real, human component grounding everything we do.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - starting with your own creative foundation before bringing in AI assistance.

When you do use AI for that refinement process after you've written your rough drafts, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout revising a piece, or do you tend to give it specific tasks to handle independently?

User: It all depends on the specific project, but if it's a block of product copy I've written, I'll often just paste the entire long form copy into the model and ask it to finesse or make it better, more engaging or whatever my goal is. I then read through what the model comes up with and will revise my own copy based on things I like about the model's suggestion. This is nice because it sometimes thinks of things in ways that I wouldn't have. I also will often ask it to make things more concise because I can be overly descriptive with my writing. After I copy the large copy block, then I'll finesse my original and if there's anything I want to refine further, I'll pull out those specific sentences and ask it to rewrite and see what it comes up with. If I'm not liking something or a certain word, I'll then even ask for it to act as a thesaurus and provide other words that we could use instead.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - it sounds like you move between different levels of collaboration depending on what you need in the moment.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: Not really. We don't yet have any policies in-place regarding AI. Being a creative firm, we see its benefits but are also wary of using it too much and degrading our own work. We strive to be great partners to our clients and they need to be able to rely on the fact that we are engaging with their brands and doing thoughtful work vs. just using AI to speed up our workflows.

AI: That balance between efficiency and maintaining quality partnerships with clients sounds like an important consideration.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm regularly both satisfied and frustrated with AI models. There are days and projects where it works fantastically and others where it falls flat. One area I was pretty satisfied with was with poetry writing. I write some children's poetry for a client and it's particularly helpful with coming up with certain rhyme schemes that I necessarily wouldn't have and much quicker than I could. However then there are times when it really misses the mark and comes up with words and rhymes that are way too advanced for children, despite the instructions to keep them simple.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can be both incredibly helpful and surprisingly off-target, even within the same type of work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It absolutely is. This is part of the reason I always make sure to write my own drafts first. I have to keep my skills sharp and detailed and specific to each client in order to set myself apart from a simple AI model. I make sure my work is thoughtful and that I'm always keeping it authentic.

AI: That intentionality about maintaining your craft really comes through in how you've described your process.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I feel that AI is here to stay and we have to find a good balance of using it to create efficiencies, while also maintaining the integrity and quality of our work. I feel that I will continue to use it to refine my work, help me brainstorm and push my skillset even further. I'd also really like to explore more ways to utilize AI for some more administrative/redundant tasks. I feel that will help me incredibly if I can harness that feature of it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using your own work as a foundation to keep that "soulful" human element in your creative process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we've covered most of what's on my mind. At the forefront of my mind is keeping the human element evident in creative work, while also utilizing AI to push boundaries and make myself even better!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with creative authenticity, and the thoughtful way you've integrated AI into your workflow while maintaining your own creative foundation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: This has been very interesting! Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! I'm so glad you found it interesting too. It was really valuable to hear your perspective as someone working in the creative field and how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your process.

Thank you again for participating in our research - your insights will definitely contribute to our understanding of how people are navigating this evolving relationship with AI at work. Have a great rest of your day!
