Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a fibre artist and I do crochet projects for a living.  Because most of my income stems from selling patterns, I use AI almost daily to help me.  I haven't been doing it for very long, so I like to use AI to give sample patterns and to check my patterns for spelling/grammar errors before I send them to be tested.  I also use AI to generate colour combination ideas, ask for advice on selling at markets, and to predict trends in crochet and knitwear.

AI: That's fascinating - I wouldn't have immediately thought about AI's role in fiber arts and pattern creation. 

When you mention using AI to generate sample patterns, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically interact with AI when you're working on pattern development?

User: I usually start with a statement like: 'I want to make a raglan cardigan that fits sizes XS-XL.  What number of starting stitches should I begin with if I want to work from the top down for a cardigan that fits size M?'

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI as a starting point for the technical calculations. 

Tell me more about what happens after you get that initial guidance. Do you take that information and then work independently from there, or do you continue collaborating with AI throughout the pattern development process?

User: I take the response and use it as my starting point.  Then, I usually take measurements and stitch counts as I go.  From there, I ask the AI about altering stitch numbers to account for different sizes based on my gauge (I will always input my gauge when asking about this)

AI: So it sounds like you're having an ongoing conversation with AI as you work through the pattern - checking in at key decision points rather than just getting one piece of advice upfront.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of pattern creation that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks feel different to you?

User: I definitely like to decide what pieces I will be making patterns for without asking AI for ideas.  Ultimately, hand-knitting and crochet are quite hard to get assistance from an AI for as it is very visual, but I like to use it as a guide.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping the creative vision and visual aspects as your domain. 

Can you share a time when using AI in your work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've not had many (if any) frustrating moments, but I always feel very satisfied when I finish a piece based off of the AI's calculations/advice and it works out perfectly!  The first time I used AI to help me, I had already undone and redone the bottom half of a tank top because I couldn't get it to fit right.  With the AI's help working out stitch count alterations, I was able to make it fit perfectly!

AI: That must have been such a relief after struggling with the fit! It sounds like that first success really built your confidence in using AI as a collaborator.

How have your colleagues or the broader fiber arts community influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that other pattern designers or fiber artists have particular attitudes about AI that have shaped your approach?

User: I haven't personally heard of any fibre artists I know/follow on social media who actively use AI and talk about it.  I feel like there is a bit of a stigma in the creative industry when it comes to AI, so it isn't very commonly spoken about!

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're navigating this somewhat on your own without much community discussion about it.

Given that atmosphere, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially help? Is developing your own technical knowledge and calculation abilities something you actively consider, even while using AI as a guide?

User: I definitely don't want to become reliant on AI to do calculations and workings out for me, as I want to maintain my own skills and develop them further.  As I am just starting out, it has been really helpful to get me kickstarted on my learning journey!

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI as a learning accelerator rather than a replacement for developing your own expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI evolving as you continue growing as a pattern designer? Do you think the way you use it will change as your skills develop?

User: I think as my skills develop I may use it slightly less, but I also think that if I am creating more patterns I might need AI's help to speed up the pattern-making process!

AI: That's such an interesting balance - potentially using it less for learning but maybe more for efficiency as your business grows.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in fiber arts. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning accelerator while being mindful about not becoming overly dependent on it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all, thank yoU!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in fiber arts - especially navigating that balance between leveraging AI as a learning tool while maintaining your own skill development - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really fascinating to learn about how AI fits into such a hands-on, creative field. Thanks again for participating!
