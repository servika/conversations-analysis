Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments, and anything you share won't be personally attributed to you.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: All good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: There are various way I use AI. I'll list them below:-

AI: Perfect, I'd love to hear about them. Go ahead and tell me about the various ways you use AI in your work.

User: * Coding: I use AI to help complete code that i'm writing. E.g. I'm in an IDE and typing out code and Copilot will suggest code. This could be a simple completion of a word, a whole function, or even a whole block of code. Sometimes I'll go to another AI and ask it to make an entire function/repo for me. Though I'd never copy/paste the whole thing. I use it as a way of leaning about functions/methods I never knew existed. Basically to point me in the right direction
* Summarising (read): For long documents that I just want a summary of to understand the key points and takeaways.
* Summarising (write): For helping me write summaries for PRs or documents that I write myself.
* Creative writing: For help with me making a LinkedIn post, Slack post etc. General small pieces of communication. Again, i rarely copy/paste the whole thing. But it gives me a good starting block.

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses. I'm curious to dig deeper into your coding approach - you mentioned you use AI to learn about functions or methods you didn't know existed, and that you'd never copy and paste a whole function or repo.

Tell me more about that. What drives you to avoid copying the whole thing, and how do you typically work with the AI-generated code suggestions?

User: There's a few reasons:-
* Trust: I generally don't trust AI. I've had it hallucinate functions/methods before which makes me wary of copy/pasting huge blocks of code. I've had it suggest ways of doing things which are not the most optimal as well. AI is a bit of a black box, copy/pasting it's code into my repo means i'm essentially putting part of that black box into my own work which I don't like.
* Self Learning: I like to know what i'm coding, how it works, how I can apply it elsewhere. Even if the AI produces perfect code I still like tweak it slightly and make it my own. I like to go line by line to understand the methods being used. If I blindly copy/paste I'll never learn anything.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the trust issue and wanting to understand what you're actually implementing. 

When you mentioned you've had AI hallucinate functions or suggest suboptimal approaches, can you walk me through what that experience was like? How did you discover the AI had given you incorrect information?

User: It was when I was looking to build out some Airflow functionality. I was relatively new to it all and it can be very confusing with OOP to know what objects have what functions. And the documentation has you looking all over the place to find the thing you want.
I asked the AI to write some code that would be executed when an Airflow task failed. Rather than using the on_failure callback it hallucinated it as dot notations. E.g. task.failure.execute(f) which was completely wrong and doesn't work at all. But to the untrained eye it totally looks legit.

I found it it didn't work when I tried to run the code. Then after a lot of googling and searching docs I found that there was no such method and I had to use callbacks instead.

AI: That's a perfect example of how convincing AI can be even when it's completely wrong. The fact that `task.failure.execute(f)` looked legitimate but was entirely fabricated is exactly the kind of thing that would make someone wary.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You've described this careful approach with coding - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself completely, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes there are two main types I prefer to do myself:-
1. Large tasks: Things like refactoring repos, creating complex systems with more than one file etc. This is because there would be so many points of failure and things to check it'd just be easier for me to do it myself and just have AI as a sidekick pointing me in the right direction for a specific ask.
2. Repetitive tasks: Things like updating all of the YAML files in our repo to have certain tests added, formatting applied, spelling changed etc. Or going through a large SQL query and applying certain repetitive changes.  I've had AI completely veer off task before for repetitive stuff. It often starts doing things well and then starts to do weird stuff that I didn't ask it to do.
Again, it comes down to the trust piece.

AI: That's really insightful - the trust factor keeps coming up, especially with repetitive tasks where the AI starts well but then goes off track. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you mentioned having AI as a "sidekick" - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it smaller, contained pieces to handle independently?

User: Yea I use it throughout a task, going back to it now and again if I get stuck or need help. Or, as mentioned before, using it for auto complete. I'll rarely give it an independent task unless that task is small and contained in of itself. E.g. make a small function which accepts A and outputs B

AI: That collaborative approach makes sense given your concerns about trust and wanting to maintain control. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others around you have similar approaches, or are there different attitudes toward AI use in your workplace?

User: We're generally very pro AI and even have our own RAG AI for internal use. Other people also use AI to ask it generic questions or point it in the right direction from what I understand (for engineers). Non technical roles tend to use it for writing documents and meeting minutes from what I know

AI: That sounds like a pretty AI-forward environment with the internal RAG system. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated: That example above around it hallucinating the Airflow code. I spent a lot of time working out that it wasn't right. I thought I was on the wrong version or something. It's just that it never existed.
Satisfied: Explaining things to me in Bash that not even google could tell me. I asked it to help me write a bash script, which has many different flags and syntax nuances that change depending on the context. I'd ask AI to explain each one and it would do so very well. Getting that information from google was hard or almost impossible.

AI: That's a great contrast - the frustration of wasted time on hallucinated code versus the satisfaction of getting clear explanations that even Google couldn't provide. The Bash example sounds particularly valuable since that kind of contextual explanation can be so hard to find in traditional documentation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It goes back to that piece around self learning and why I'll never copy/paste code. I want to keep learning and growing as I'm very aware that AI could overtake me. I don't think it would ever replace me, you always need a human to understand the business context. But I'm worried AI may make the output of my role higher; setting a new standard

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the idea that AI might not replace you but could raise the bar for what's expected. The concern about output standards changing is something I hadn't heard put quite that way before.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you interact with it, or do you think you'll stick with this collaborative, cautious approach?

User: I think I'll maintain the collaborative approach for now. When we get more robust AI which I can trust more, then I'll let it do larger tasks for me or even integrate it into my code.

AI: That makes sense - trust seems to be the key factor that would unlock more substantial AI delegation for you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while preserving your own learning and staying cautious about trust.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope all good thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the trust dynamics, the collaborative approach, and how you think about skill development in an AI-enhanced workplace will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through those specific examples - they paint a clear picture of how you navigate working with AI tools. Thanks again!
