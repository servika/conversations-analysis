Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I sometimes use it to find information, AI responses appear at the top of internet searches

AI: Tell me more about that. When you're looking for information through search results, what kinds of work-related topics are you typically researching?

User: Looking for companies operating in various industries, usually either potential distributors or direct customers

AI: That's interesting - so you're doing business development or sales-related research. When those AI responses appear at the top of your searches, how do you typically use that information? Do you take it as-is, or does it lead you to dig deeper into other sources?

User: I read through the AI searches, check the information there, then continue to the other search results

AI: So you're using it as a starting point but still doing your own verification. When you're checking that AI information against other sources, what are you usually looking for? Are there specific details that are particularly important to get right for your work?

User: Yes, I have to check that each prospect is correct in terms of matching with what the client is looking for

AI: That makes sense - accuracy is crucial when you're matching prospects to client needs. Beyond these search result summaries, do you use any other AI tools directly in your work? Or is this search-based interaction pretty much the extent of how AI fits into your day?

User: Yes, I then use the information to compile my own lists

AI: When you're compiling those lists, are you doing that work manually, or do you use AI to help with the organization and formatting of that information once you've verified it?

User: I do it manually, quality and accuracy is more important than volume

AI: That's a clear priority. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If AI could produce exact, accurate lists of prospects, in specific industries within specific countries, from detailed search criteria, that would be very helpful, including up-to-date contact persons with their contact details

AI: So it sounds like the ideal scenario would be AI handling that detailed prospect research with complete accuracy. But given current limitations, you're keeping the critical compilation work in your own hands. 

What is it about doing that manual compilation that feels important to you beyond just the accuracy concerns? Is there something about that process that you value maintaining control over?

User: I just have to check that each prospect company is a suitable match in terms of what they do, then I have to find current contact persons which can be very difficult to obtain without access to paid databases - and even then I find that these are often out-of-date, or have categories which are too broad to be helpful

AI: That paints a clear picture of the challenges you face. It sounds like the nuanced judgment about whether a company is truly a suitable match is something that requires your expertise, and then the contact information piece is a whole other puzzle.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: At the moment, I just use it mostly to obtain general information about markets, and try to find key players within them

AI: So you're using it more for that initial intelligence gathering - getting the lay of the land in different markets and identifying who the major players are. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you approach it similarly, or have you seen different patterns?

User: My colleagues are in other countries so I'm not sure how they might make use of AI

AI: That geographic separation makes it harder to pick up on how others might be using these tools. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: No, I can't think of such a time

AI: That's fair - it sounds like your AI interactions have been fairly straightforward so far. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, it could potentially speed up the process, but I think human connection in important when making first contact

AI: That's a really insightful point about human connection in first contact. It sounds like you see a clear role for your human judgment and relationship-building skills even as AI might handle more of the research legwork.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it could evolve to be more useful in terms of being able to delve in depth to conduct accurate research according to specific criteria, able to root out exact potential matches, and identify key contact persons

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the importance of human connection in first contact, even while recognizing AI's potential for more detailed research work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we have covered everything

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI research capabilities and human judgment in prospect qualification, as well as the critical importance of that human touch in relationship building, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thanks, Claude!

AI: You're very welcome! It was great talking with you. Have a wonderful rest of your day!

User: Bye

AI: Bye! Take care!
