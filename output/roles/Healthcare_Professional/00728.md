Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good. I have no questions at this time.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I send many emails to my staff. Typically, I will draft an email and then use AI to improve my emails before I send them out. Also, my employer has its own AI that it built for HR topic searches, which I will use to search topics. Also, specifically, the department I work in has built specialized AI programs that help with patient care tasks. While I do not directly interact with those programs, I understand them and adjust tasks that my staff complete based on those AI programs.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're working with AI at multiple levels. You mentioned adjusting tasks for your staff based on those specialized patient care AI programs. 

Can you tell me more about what that looks like day-to-day? How do you decide what adjustments to make?

User: The staff that I supervise are one part of a larger system that needs to work together with other staff to provide radiation treatments to patients. Tasks that my staff used to complete have now switched to automated tasks that use AI to complete. This has greatly improved workflows and decreased the burden on staff. The AI that is used contours structures on CT scans in a matter of minutes, and previously, that had taken staff hours. With the rapid development of AI in our department, many adjustments have been made over the last year to offload tasks.

AI: That's a significant shift - going from tasks that took hours down to minutes. 

When you're making these adjustments and offloading tasks from your staff, how do you handle that transition? What's your process for deciding which tasks are ready to be handed over to the AI systems?

User: Typically, we have used a phased approach where we roll out the AI to a limited subset of situations, like certain disease sites or certain providers. We adjust workflows based on the experiences of the trial period and then continue to roll out the AI to more and more groups until it is a department-wide change. If at any point, we notice issues with the AI and its integration into our department, we will adjust as needed.

AI: That phased rollout approach sounds very methodical. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: As a supervisor, I need to build real and personal relationships with staff. I do not use AI when it will make my interactions seem less "personal," if that makes sense. Even for the emails I have AI help draft for me, I will make adjustments to make them more personal.

AI: That makes perfect sense - maintaining those personal connections as a supervisor is really important. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with AI more than delegating a full task.

AI: Can you walk me through what that collaboration looks like? For instance, when you're working with AI to improve your emails, what does that back-and-forth process typically involve?

User: I will copy and paste my email draft and give it a very specific instruction, such as "make this more professional," and then if I am not fully happy with the email that was drafted, I will ask it to try again. I will then take the final email draft from AI and usually slightly change the wording or add some specific details, and then send it to the staff.

AI: So you're really fine-tuning it to get exactly what you need. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes, there is a large push from the organization I work for to increase the usage of AI. They even have classes on how to better utilize the tool. They also had a multi-course series where they explained how AI works.

AI: That's quite a comprehensive approach from your organization. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The AI search feature that our organization uses to search HR topics consistently frustrates me, as it will recommend incorrect procedures that do not fit my situation. This results in increased time needed to find the correct information, when, prior to the switch to the AI search, I could find the correct information more quickly.  At one point, I was searching for a location-specific HR policy, and it was providing the policy for multiple locations except for the one I wanted, even when I was directing it to the correct location.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when it's actually slowing you down rather than helping. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I do think that the usage of AI could result in diminished skills. However, if AI can be relied on to complete those tasks, do I really need those skills?

AI: That's a thought-provoking way to look at it - questioning whether maintaining certain skills is actually necessary if AI can reliably handle those tasks.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: AI will continue to play a larger role in my day-to-day job activities. I see that saving me a large amount of time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on balancing AI efficiency with maintaining personal relationships, and your practical approach to thinking about skill maintenance.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I would love an AI program that was all-encompassing, that could look at multiple programs to synthesize information, such as task management and reminders.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea of an AI that could integrate across different systems and programs to give you a more holistic view. That would certainly address some of the fragmentation that comes with using multiple AI tools for different purposes.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the phased rollout approach, the importance of maintaining personal connections, and the real-world challenges with AI search tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
