Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, lets go

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI is not used very often in my workday, the most it would be used is in emails when writing emails when AI will suggest what to write or to add events to my calendar etc.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like your AI use is more on the peripheral, with those built-in suggestions rather than actively seeking it out for specific tasks.

When you do get those email suggestions or calendar prompts, how do you typically respond to them? Do you find yourself accepting the AI's suggestions, or do you usually modify them?

User: Half and half, when I'm writing and AI suggests the next word, sometimes it is correct and sometimes it is not so it depends.

AI: That makes sense - you're evaluating each suggestion as it comes.

Tell me more about those times when the AI suggestion isn't quite right. What tends to be off about it - is it the tone, the content, or something else entirely?

User: Normally just the wrong words for the context of the email or situation.

AI: I see - so it's more about the AI not fully grasping the specific context you're working in.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Sometimes AI suggests to send a response with a specific response. I want to write it myself and make sure I send it so I can review it first.

AI: That's a really important point - you want that review step to make sure it aligns with what you actually want to communicate.

When you do choose to write those responses yourself instead of using the AI suggestion, what goes through your mind during that decision? What are you thinking about as you decide to take control of that task?

User: Normally it is I have a specific way I want to respond that the AI has not captured and I think I need to step in to make sure the specifics are written.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like there are nuances in your communication style or specific details that you feel the AI misses.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate in partnership with it, I do not let it do anything by itself without me at least reviewing it before being sent off. But I always use it at the same time I am working on it, I never just set it off to do tasks.

AI: That collaborative approach is really interesting - you're working alongside it rather than handing things off.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you notice differences in how people around you approach these tools?

User: There hasn't been any discussion on the use of AI in the workplace by my colleagues. I have not noticed how people use it if any.

AI: So it sounds like AI use isn't really something that's openly discussed or visible in your workplace environment.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I feel satisfied when AI can succesfully predict what I am typing so I can finish my emails quicker without writing full words, or automatically corrects my spelling as it is rather bad but if it autocorrects as it writes I don't have to go back and sort it.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like when AI works seamlessly in the background to speed up your workflow, that's when it really adds value for you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think there will ever be a full AI takeover in the important areas in my work as there always needs to be a human component. So if there is any AI takeover, it will just make my role easier. However, I would want to maintain my skills in all areas to allow myself to be able to work with or without AI.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - maintaining your independence while still being open to the efficiency gains.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see AI still being used in communications at work and maybe being used for tasks that do not need human intervention, which can make my job easier.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to maintain your skills while being open to AI making your role easier, and how you approach AI as a collaborative partner rather than something you delegate to completely.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining that essential human oversight will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
