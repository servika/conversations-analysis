Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use it for data analytics (Excel, google sheets) helping me compile & compare data for my role. I also use it as a research tool, helping me gather information faster than I could manually

AI: That's helpful context. When you're using AI for data analytics with Excel and Google Sheets, what does that process actually look like for you? Are you asking it to write formulas, interpret results, or something else?

User: Help me write complex formulas that would take me very long to research & develop

AI: I see. So you're turning to AI when you hit those formula challenges that would otherwise send you down a research rabbit hole.

When you think about your work with data analytics, are there parts of that process you still prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with those areas too?

User: I always double check the results, as I don't fully trust AI yet. I also prefer to only use AI for mundane, repeatable tasks. Not so much for one-offs

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned preferring AI for mundane, repeatable tasks rather than one-offs. Can you tell me more about that distinction? What makes you draw that line?

User: Usually data that is included in reports on regular intervals (monthly budget reports, monthly benchmarks, quarterly, yearly, etc.) For specific projects, I prefer to do it myself.

AI: That makes sense. When you're working on those regular reports with AI - like your monthly budget reports - how do you typically structure that interaction? Do you find yourself working back and forth with the AI throughout the process, or do you give it the task and let it run with it?

User: I usually go back & forth with it. I think AI isn't where it should be for me to give it a task & let it run with it. Especially with integrated AI tools such as Copilot in Excel. Again, it is a good tool but I don't trust it completely yet.

AI: You've mentioned trust a couple of times now - not fully trusting AI and feeling it's not quite where it should be yet. Can you walk me through what that looks like when your trust gets tested? Have there been specific moments where the AI got something wrong or didn't meet your expectations?

User: Yes, sometimes it doesn't correctly call back to certain cells, rows, columns so I always have do double check. I'd say 50% of the time its right & there's no need for me to go back & forth to correct the mistakes.

AI: So you're essentially working with a 50-50 success rate on those formula references. That's quite a bit of back-and-forth correction.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this pretty independently?

User: It has been presented to us as a tool, however I find that I'm really the only one using it in this manner. Most use it for summarizing memo's or stuff like that. Not much data analytics as far as I know

AI: So you're somewhat of a pioneer in your workplace when it comes to using AI for data analytics. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have a spreadsheet of hundreds of projects with information such as: project identifier, cost estimate, actual costs as well as many more fields that is static. I also have live data on another tab of that file that is living that has  project identifier, cost estimate, actual costs that is up to date. I asked the AI to pull all the estimates & charges from the live sheet & match them up by project ID & display them on my project static sheet so I can easily track if I'm over or under budget on my projects. It performed flawlessly after a few back & forth conversations & saved me days of time instead of doing it manually.

AI: That sounds like a significant win - saving days of manual work on budget tracking across hundreds of projects. What made that particular interaction work so well compared to other times when you've had to go back and forth more to get things right?

User: May have been how I inputted the information. I was sure to be very specific on this request.

AI: That's a valuable insight about being specific in your requests. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or are you planning to keep it within these current boundaries?

User: As long as AI keeps evolving & proving its value & worth, I plan on expanding my use of it

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on drawing that line between using AI for routine, repeatable tasks versus keeping the one-off projects for yourself, and how being specific in your requests makes such a difference in the outcomes.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about trust, the importance of specificity in requests, and how you're pioneering AI use for data analytics in your workplace will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thanks

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
