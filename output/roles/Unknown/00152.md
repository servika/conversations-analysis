Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine. I do not have any questions, and am ready to begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical work day I use it to come up with a unique snow cone flavor, name, and description. I then have it create a post for me to use on social media.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI for creative marketing content in what sounds like a food business. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're working on these snow cone flavors, are you starting completely from scratch or do you give the AI some direction about what you're looking for?

User: So I will usually provide a list of about 10 to 15 flavors that are not used as much, and allow it to make a combinations that would sound appealing to customers. I then request a fun name for the creation and a brief description on why customers should try it out.

AI: That sounds like a really creative approach to menu development. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes there are some task that I prefer to handle my self. All of the financial tasks are done by me as well as the scheduling. Those task are more important and I do not want to blindly trust AI to do them. I feel as if I would go over the AI work anyway to double check it so I might as well just do it my self. The creative aspect is easier to let go of.

AI: That's really insightful - you're drawing a clear line between tasks based on their importance and the consequences of errors. 

When you use AI for the creative snow cone content, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the task, or do you tend to delegate the complete flavor creation process for it to handle independently?

User: If the suggestion is bad and I do not think the flavors will taste good I will tell it so and have it try again. Usually I let it handle it independently.  Sometimes I will mention if there is a holiday or a silly national day of (something) so it can use that for inspiration. If the suggestion is good though and not something that we have used recently though I will just use it as is.

AI: That gives me a clear picture of how you work together. It sounds like you provide the parameters upfront and then evaluate the output, stepping in when needed.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: There has not been any outside influence. I usually work alone.

AI: I see, so you've developed your own approach to using AI without external workplace pressures.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I struggle with being creative and have a hard time making things sound fun and exciting so when the suggestions are good its great! When I have to keep asking for another idea or correct something a few times I get frustrated.

AI: That really captures the double-edged nature of working with AI - it can be such a relief when it fills a gap in your skills, but frustrating when it's not quite hitting the mark.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I honestly don't think I will every to be  comfortable with it taking over some areas completely. I think running the numbers myself will always be how I work.  On the other hand I do see potentially having it run the numbers on projections just to give me estimates of things. I would probably run the same numbers and see if they are similar.  I never want to rely on AI to the point that I could not run my business without it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - maintaining that independence while still leveraging AI as a tool when it makes sense.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think so. It seems to be getting better all the time and able to do more things correctly consistently. Emails, scheduling, and keeping track of things are some areas I would consider using it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining independence from AI while still leveraging it strategically for creative tasks where you feel less confident.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance creative collaboration with AI while maintaining control over critical business functions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
