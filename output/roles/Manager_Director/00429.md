Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As an IT manager I use AI to automate email creation as well as generate spreadsheets for tracking projects. I utilize AI to fine tune research of processes that involve multiple steps. I've also used AI to generate blurbs for company newsletters, to draft emails to employees and vendors and to generate RFP's.

AI: That's quite a range of applications you've found for AI. You mentioned using it for multi-step process research - can you tell me more about that? What does that look like in practice?

User: For example I've used AI to help me create a process that creates a list template in Microsoft Lists and the corresponding forms and then automate the creation of emails and calendar entries. I have also used it to automate the creation of emails that compile information from multiple sources such as spreadsheets and resource documentation.

AI: That sounds like some pretty sophisticated automation work. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If an email involves a conversation that should be more personable I tend to create it myself. I also avoid using AI to create or research anything that involves our security set up or secure processes. I utilize well documented and secure methods to research sensitive topics that involve these types of company information.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the personal touch and security considerations are important distinctions. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: At first I will delegate the task to the AI and then as I make the search or the request more granular and streamline it to produce the output I need, it becomes more conversation and less instructional.

AI: That's an interesting evolution - starting with delegation and then moving into more of a collaborative back-and-forth as you refine what you need. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace is embracing AI as we look forward to developing our own in house chatbot to use for helpdesk purposes. My director is enthusiastic about the benefits that AI can provide and we actively look for ways to use it to our advantage.

AI: It sounds like you're in a pretty AI-forward environment, which must make experimentation easier. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have had many successful AI interactions, with the most satisfactory ones being when I realized how much time it save me throughout the day as I have been able to use it to create automated tasks that I may have done manually to this day. I have had some frustrations. I have noticed as the conversations grow it takes alot of computer resources to run the AI. This causes some slowness of the computer and the AI response. I have also found that sometimes AI will say it generates a document for download, but does not provide a link to the document. That can be frustrating for sure.

AI: Those are really concrete examples - the time savings from automation versus the technical limitations you bump up against. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: While I can see AI becoming a key part of IT in the programming and coding realm, I mainly manage Systems and Network infrastructure, which requires a set of hands to perform the job. There are some aspects of AI that we use that are great. For example our WiFi access points rely on AI monitoring our Wireless environment and making changes to the channel and power levels to prevent co-channel interference.

AI: That's a great point about AI working behind the scenes in your infrastructure while still needing human oversight and hands-on management. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe it will free up many tasks that just take up time and free me an my team up to focus on more complex and important tasks. This will benefit the organization in both ingenuity and efficiency. I see myself utilizing it more to compile information about my staff to better guide them to success in their jobs.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI is already working behind the scenes in your infrastructure, and your vision for how it could help you better support your team's development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: NO

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing automation with security considerations, the evolution from delegation to collaboration, and your vision for AI freeing up time for more complex work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
