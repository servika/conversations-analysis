Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not. Thanks for inviting me.

AI: Perfect, thank you for being here. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI constantly at work. I was definitely an early adopter of AI and was very intrigued by its possibilities. I work in a contact center and I am strong believer that language choices matter so when I saw a tool that could help me find the right words I was obsessed. I considered myself pretty skilled at crafting a message, but having that extra boost when I was struggling to find the words was amazing. I regularly using to help tweak my messages to convey the perfect tone and sentiment I am looking for. I have also used it to create templates for agents to use, draft presentations, and create training materials among other things.

AI: That's fascinating that you recognized AI's potential for language crafting so early on. You mentioned using it to "tweak messages to convey the perfect tone and sentiment" - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you work with AI when you're struggling to find the right words?

User: Typically I will have a pretty good idea of what I want to say, but I can be a bit verbose. I will typically draft a message and then ask for edits to tone and to make it more concise without losing the key points of the message. I often find there will be just one sentence that is not landing right and I love being able to ask a model to give me 5 options for how to word that sentence. Even when I do I find I will pull the beginning of the sentence from one option and the end of another and mash them into the exact option I was looking for. I also like letting it do the cleanup work for grammar and typos so I can spend less time proof reading and more time on getting the message right.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - it sounds like you're using AI almost like a collaborative writing partner rather than having it write from scratch. When you mentioned pulling parts from different sentence options and "mashing them together," it suggests you're staying very involved in the creative process.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I think calling it a collaborative process is hitting the nail on the head, and even though I love to use it as a tool to help me achieve that goal I could never just release that control and let a model take over my communication. Even the model that knows my style the best still can't get the nuance of my tone right without me there for final edits.

AI: That's a really insightful point about maintaining control over your communication. It sounds like there's something about that final layer of nuance and tone that feels uniquely yours.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern in more detail? You've touched on this collaborative approach - are you more likely to work with it back-and-forth throughout a task, or are there times when you delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am really looking for AI to be able to handle more tasks directly in the future and I would love to be able to hand those off to an AI independently. For example there is a daily process where I go through all of the contacts for a contact center. I have to check them for accuracy on a lot of different points. We are talking about hundreds of contacts a day. Once I have gone through them all I then have to compile the needed corrections and create emails to send to each agent alerting them of the list of corrections that are needed. I would love for an AI tool to go over the list, flag likely errors for review, and then once I approve them automatically pull up and email to the agent, draft and send it. This would save hours of time for me. The tech is getting close, but we still aren't there yet that I can access.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of repetitive, detail-oriented work where AI could really shine - reviewing hundreds of contacts and then generating personalized correction emails. It's interesting that you can envision that future workflow so clearly.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your contact center as enthusiastic about these tools as you are?

User: That's actually quite interesting because I get a lot of flack for being the AI guy and being the guy who is gonna help the machines take over, but I also get approached for helping them find creative solutions to their problems and get the most out of the tools available. I typically liken it to a calculator. When my parents were growing up there was lots of pushback because you were never going to have a calculator with you, but now we all have one in our pocket at all times. This is that new tool that can help make our lives easier, and it isn't going away either, so burying your head in the sand is foolish. More and more the organization has come around to understand the importance and they are looking to drive initiatives to maximize the ROI from these tools so it is cool to be at the head of that movement.

AI: That calculator analogy is really compelling - and it sounds like you're experiencing both sides of being an early adopter. People tease you about being "the AI guy" but then come to you for help when they need it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can share both. At work they recently adopted an AI tool that integrates with all of a major tech giants offerings. There was an extensive training that needed to be completed that promised the world, but in practice it has fallen significantly short of those promises. It spends more time telling me that it can't do things I know it should be able to do or telling me that it did do something when it didn't, then actually doing what I need. On the flip side I was particularly satisfied when I was able to create an "agent" that could help respond to a new product that we launched that was quite complicated. This product is high stakes and the response to these contacts needs to be very specific, but with some effort and trial and error the agent is able to deliver responses that only need minimal tweaking before they can be sent to the consumer saving me significant time and effort.

AI: That contrast is really striking - the frustration with a tool that overpromises but can't deliver basic functions versus the satisfaction of building something that actually works for your high-stakes communications.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: There is concern about AI taking over and eliminating jobs. For me, that is a big part of why I wanted to learn about the tool, and understand how it operates. While the models are incredible at creating quality work, getting them to deliver something very specific when it comes to tone, content, and accuracy is a skill in itself. I want to continue to learn about AI so when a role does transition I can be the guy who is responsible for going into the backend and adjusting the settings and prompts and doing QA work.

AI: That's such a strategic mindset - positioning yourself as the person who understands both the human side of communication and the technical side of making AI work effectively. It sounds like you see prompt engineering and AI management as becoming valuable skills in their own right.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It is going to become a requirement that we innovate and find ways to drive goals using the tool. It will be a part of everyone's workflow in some way.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being a collaborative partner with AI rather than just delegating tasks wholesale, and how you're strategically positioning yourself to understand both sides of the human-AI equation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I just think it is important to be responsible as we look towards the future. AI should not replace humans in the work force, but instead should be a tool to help reduce time consuming low importance tasks to free them up for higher stakes and more creative endeavors.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to frame it - AI as a tool that elevates human work rather than replaces it. The idea of freeing people up for higher-stakes and more creative work while handling the time-consuming routine tasks seems to align perfectly with how you've been using these tools yourself.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the importance of maintaining control over nuanced communication, and your strategic approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
