Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions, go ahead

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use AI to quickly explain things that I don't have the time to manually search myself on the internet (like programming languages' documentation), and when the response seems dubious to me I ask the AI for links to its sources. I also use it to code small portions of code that I could perfectly write myself but I prefer giving him the task to save me time.

AI: That's interesting - you mention using AI for both research and coding tasks where you could handle them yourself but choose not to. 

Tell me more about how you decide when something is worth delegating to AI versus doing it yourself, especially for those coding tasks you mentioned.

User: I'd say something is worth delegating to AI when it's not too complex and I can easily verify its correctness. It's basically when it's a task I could definitely do myself in 15 minutes but I'd rather let the AI do it in seconds to save me time.

AI: That's a helpful way to think about it - using that 15-minute threshold and your ability to verify the results.

When you do delegate those tasks to AI, how do you typically interact with it? Do you give it the complete task upfront and let it handle everything, or do you find yourself going back and forth with it as it works?

User: I try to fit as much context as possible into the initial prompt and test the result, then go into more detail, add some preferences and provide specific fixes if the result from the initial prompt doesn't completely fit my initial need.

AI: So you start broad and then refine - that sounds like a collaborative approach where you're guiding the AI through iterations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: We're working on building proprietary software so we're highly prohibited to share code into our AI conversations as that code is intellectual property, so I can't just copy paste a script from our source code and say "Fix it". It has made me use AI in a more thoughtful way, making my way through generating code from scratch from a simple text description. without explicitly providing an existing piece of code. As for my colleagues, I've started working with them only a few weeks ago so I didn't really have time to discuss their approach with AI with them.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the IP restrictions actually changing how you interact with AI - having to be more descriptive and thoughtful rather than just copying and pasting code.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I remember that very specific time where in order to manage different revisions of our main software, we had to copy paste a long, tedious command line with just a folder name that changes, that creates a git worktree and puts it in a specific directory. since we already know the directory and it's a fixed one, I just had to ask the AI to make a cshell script that takes the folder's name as argument to then call that long command line. It was pretty easy, I could do it myself but I was busy learning other things on the side so I delegated that task to the AI and it gave me the perfect solution, first try, in seconds. Then I just had to use that script to create my git worktrees faster.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI fitting into your workflow - a task that was straightforward but tedious, and you got exactly what you needed immediately.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I personally think that I'll still need to maintain my skill in those areas as AI is still prone to make mistakes, so there will always be a need for human expertise to not only figure those errors, but also explain to the AI what went wrong and guide it the right way to fix it instead of just copypasting the code and saying "fix that". That's why I also think the future will be a mix of hard development skills and prompt engineering, so that we have the knowledge to understand what to ask and how to ask it, how it should be done, to determine accurately if those specifications were met by the AI's response or not, and to know exactly what debugging insights to provide if the AI messes things up.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on how technical expertise and AI interaction skills will work together. You're seeing AI as a tool that requires deep understanding to use effectively rather than something that replaces that understanding.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as both the technology improves and you get more experience with it?

User: I can only see it growing, although I still may be scared of actually losing my job in the end if the AI manages to gain the capacity of thinking independently to analyze its own mistakes and fix them with 100% accuracy. But I think it highly depends on its context window, which is limited in size due to requirements and/or issues out of my knowledge, so I guess it will take longer depending on how the technology evolves

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how IP restrictions have actually made you more thoughtful about prompting, and your view of the future requiring both technical skills and prompt engineering expertise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yea I just want to ask you not to steal our jobs lmao

AI: Ha! I can definitely understand that concern - it came through in your earlier response too about being scared of potentially losing your job if AI becomes completely independent.

That's actually a really valuable insight for our research - that even people who are actively using and benefiting from AI tools still have that underlying worry about job displacement. It sounds like you're navigating this balance of embracing AI as a productivity tool while also being mindful of its broader implications for your field.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly, including that honest concern at the end. Your insights about everything from IP-conscious prompting to the future skills mix will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
