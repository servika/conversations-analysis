Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments, and anything you share won't be personally attributed to you.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: When I use AI it's typically to brainstorm, to help create proposals for new clients and bounce ideas off before taking them to a client.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a thinking partner in your client work. 

Tell me more about that brainstorming process. What does a typical session look like when you're bouncing ideas off AI?

User: Usually I'll outline my needs like, give me a tagline for business XYZ. I describe the business and then work with AI to come up with some options to take to my clients.

AI: I see, so you're working in what sounds like marketing or branding. When you're developing those tagline options with AI, what happens next in your process? Do you take the AI-generated options directly to clients, or do you modify them first?

User: Yes, that exactly what I'm doing. And now, usually I go back and forth with the AI until I get acceptable options or that the options they provide, trigger an idea I hadn't thought of. I'll then compile a list and provide it to the client for their feedback.

AI: That back-and-forth process you described is really interesting - where the AI options sometimes trigger ideas you hadn't thought of. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like? How do you know when an AI suggestion has sparked something new for you?

User: So often I'll ask something along the lines of "give me a list of taglines for business XYZ. Include some are alliterative, some that a fun, and some that are more professional." And a lot of times after some back and forth, I'll see an option in one list and an option in another that may cause me to combine to two or find words that are synonymous to have the suggestions align better with the business' brand.

AI: That's a fascinating process - using AI suggestions as building blocks that you then combine or modify. It sounds like you're really collaborating with the AI rather than just taking what it gives you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your branding work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: So there are two. Logo development/image sourcing/branding and content writing. I have yet to use a model that effectively develops a logo to a standard that I'm comfortable providing to a client. I have also tried to use AI for creating logos for presentations and websites and haven't been able to produce realistic enough content to include. As for content writing, I might use AI as a starting point or to help outline things, but one of the best skills is writing tailored content for clients and putting it into their individual voices which AI tools can't do as they don't know  my client.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're keeping the tasks that require deep knowledge of your specific clients and visual quality standards that meet your professional bar.

When you do use AI for content writing as a starting point or for outlining, how do you typically transform that initial AI output into something that captures your client's individual voice?

User: So I'll often take it to a Word document and revise and add to each section, paying attention to the tone.

AI: I see - so you're doing significant revision work to get it to sound right for each client.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like with taglines you collaborate throughout the process, but are there other tasks where you tend to delegate something complete for AI to handle independently?

User: You're right. It does vary based on the type of interaction I'm after. Usually I'll start by clearly identifying my intent and outline what I'm looking for from the AI. I typically determine this before going to an AI platform. At this time, I would say that there isn't task where I completely delegate something to AI to handle independently. I see AI as more of a collaboration tool vs. something to do my job, if that makes sense. Also as a consultant, its my work needs to be consistent and I haven't found that consistency yet from the platform's I've tried.

AI: That makes perfect sense - consistency is crucial when your reputation and client relationships are on the line. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your field talking about it, or is this something you're exploring more independently?

User: I would say in my field, I'm an early adopter. Its seen somewhat as something that can replace our profession, but I strongly believe that when used a collaboration tool, its transformative. I have noticed a trend where non-professionals are using it for things like website content and media/social media statements. And you can tell it was written by AI, so that might be where the fear of being replaced is coming from.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the difference between professional collaboration with AI versus non-professionals using it as a complete replacement. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was working on branding for a client's new business and felt I hit multiple walls trying to come up with its tagline. It was a pet business but the suggestions didn't align at all with what I was going for. I tried a couple of platforms and they resulted in the same frustration. I felt like I asked for gentle redirects, however the models went way out to left field. I wasn't able to find the balance I was looking for.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to give the AI gentle course corrections but it's not picking up on the nuance you're looking for.

What do you think was missing in that interaction? Was it that the AI didn't understand the specific balance you were trying to strike, or something else about how it was interpreting your guidance?

User: It definitely seemed like the AI didn't understand the balance I was after. Given the nature of the business, a balance between professional and whimsical was required and I tried a few different approaches and was satisfied at the end of it.

AI: That's really telling - it sounds like that nuanced balance between professional and whimsical is exactly the kind of subtle understanding that requires deep knowledge of the client and industry context.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I've definitely considered this, but it honestly doesn't concern me. I've already found ways to upskill using AI.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - using AI as a way to upskill rather than seeing it as a threat.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it becoming more integrated with my life. I've also been a curious person and thrive when I'm learning new things. AI is a wealth of knowledge at my hands and why wouldn't I use it. Specifically related to work, I see using it to expand my skillset into areas of interest that I wouldn't be able to reach if I didn't have AI to guide me there.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - AI as a guide to help you explore new areas of interest and expand your capabilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you distinguish between using AI as a collaboration tool versus a replacement, and your view of AI as helping you upskill rather than threatening your expertise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, nothing that I can think of.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner in your branding work, the importance of maintaining professional standards and client voice, and your perspective as an early adopter in your field will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the successes and frustrations - that gives us a much richer understanding of how these tools are actually being used in practice.

Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
