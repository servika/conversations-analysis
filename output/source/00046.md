Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good, do you know how many questions there will be and how detailed should I be with examples?

AI: Great questions! I have about 6 main questions planned, though we might dive deeper into certain areas based on what you share. The whole conversation should take around 10 minutes.

As for detail - I'd love to hear specific examples when you have them. The more concrete you can be about actual projects or tasks you've worked on, the better. Real stories and experiences are much more valuable to us than general thoughts, so don't hesitate to get into the specifics of what you've tried, what worked, what didn't, and how you made those decisions.

Ready to jump in?

User: Yes, please.

AI: Perfect! Let's start with the big picture.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I recently submitted a mini-project style assignment on The Millennium Bridge. This project was part of some small group work that I did, more specifically I completed this with a colleague. We had to choose a topic that was an area of mathematics that interested us, we chose this as we both enjoy music in our free time. Initially, we brainstormed doing a project on how frequency and amplitude change the sounds of a sound wave. We then moved to The Millennium Bridge as it is a famous engineering fail that with a small consideration could have had no issues. After we had chosen our topic, we individually researched different areas. My focus was on the mathematical equations that we wanted to include. I then looked at graphical representations of damping and the equations associated with this. After, we presented this in a Latex document. Once the Latex assignment was completed, we performed a verbal presentation without this document as a reference point. We were allowed a whiteboard and pen only and presented this to an audience of 14 people.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - I can see why the Millennium Bridge would be compelling from both a mathematical and engineering perspective.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I had some issues with the images that we included, when I inserted these into the document in the suggested way (in the Latex reference document I had), the image was formatted on the left hand side of the document. I wanted the document to be centred, so used AI to edit the Latex script so that the image was central. I used AI to include the correct spaces and formatting so all of the text was in the centre of the image and not trailing beyond the page. I used AI to produce a key of all of the variables in the equations. I included the image of the graphs that displayed the damping effects and used AI to check which example was relevant to The Millennium Bridge.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for those specific formatting and verification tasks.

User: I chose to use AI because I felt the resource document I had for Latex was dated. I felt the resources available online had too much confusing and conflicting information on them. When I copied information from these online resources to paste into my own Latex script and adapt, my document got progressively more jumbled. There was a deadline I felt I had to meet soon and so I had to ask AI to meet this deadline. At points, I felt I had exhausted all of my traditional options so used AI to aid me.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like AI became your go-to when traditional resources weren't working and you were under time pressure.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you didn't use AI - like the initial brainstorming, the mathematical research, or preparing for the verbal presentation - what kept you from trying it there?

User: As we were having a discussion as a pair for the initial brainstorming and we both felt as though it was important to collaborate and work together as opposed to using AI. A group interaction is a powerful skill to have as this is an expectation for many jobs. I also have a passion for learning, we both wanted to extract this information ourselves and learn with the additional context that many documents provide. The preparation for the verbal presentation was not done with AI as I feel confident in my skills with this as I am experienced.

AI: We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

I'm curious about something you mentioned - when you used AI to check which damping example was relevant to The Millennium Bridge, how did you verify or validate what it told you?

User: I checked with my group partner who had gone away and done their own research that was not AI based and she verified what I had stated with a report she had.

AI: That's a smart approach - using your partner's independent research as validation.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I wish that AI could understand more complex equations and formulas without needing to be guided. For example, AI tends to make common mistakes with calculus. I recently ran into some issues asking AI to find the Fourier Series expansion for a function f(x). It completely missed out on dividing by certain integers.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a backup when traditional resources fail, while still valuing human collaboration and independent learning, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, thank you!

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into your workflow as a complement to - rather than replacement for - traditional research methods and collaboration really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real academic work. The way you described using your partner's independent research to validate AI outputs was especially valuable.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
