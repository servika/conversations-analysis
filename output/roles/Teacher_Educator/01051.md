Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a homeschool teacher and teach multiple grades. I use AI on a daily basis to look up information for lessons. I ask it to find applicable websites or videos to enhance learning on specific topics. I use it to develop lesson plans and routines for students and for teaching schedules. I use it to look up specific curriculum content and state standards for lessons to make sure i'm adequately covering content required. I use it for find creative ideas to enhance learning like hands-on projects, crafts, music, activities that correlate with topics.  It has been very helpful as I teach multiple grades to help me tailor lessons on the same topic but at age appropriate levels.

AI: That sounds like AI has become quite integral to your teaching. You mentioned using it to tailor lessons for different grade levels on the same topic - could you walk me through what that process looks like for you?

User: For example I tell AI that we are learning about marine biology and I have student in Pre-K, Kindergarten, 3rd grade, and 5th grade. Can you find marine biology activities tailored towards younger kids about a Kindergarten level and activities to help enhance learning for about 4th grade level I can use with the older kids? So they all are studying the same subject but have age appropriate activities.

AI: That's a really practical way to differentiate instruction. When you get those activity suggestions from AI, what happens next - do you typically use them as-is, or do you find yourself modifying them based on your knowledge of your specific students?

User: AI usually gives me great ideas but then yes, I do often modify them to best work for my specific students.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I've asked AI to help me structure my day, make a daily lesson plan and schedule but I prefer to do this on my own as it doesn't understand the specific variable I have to consider and takes longer to keep having AI modify it to work best for me and my students than to just do it myself. I think if I put in the time to customize it and then could go back in and it would use that previous information to make small adjustments it could be helpful. It would just take alot of time upfront to get to that point.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like the daily scheduling requires too much specific context about your situation for AI to be immediately helpful. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate with it throughout a task as it needs modifications most of the time.

AI: Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like? Maybe walk me through a recent time when you worked back and forth with AI on something?

User: I asked it recently to help me find ideas for age appropriate books to read aloud to my students and develop lists of appropriate books for each student to read independently. Collaboration helped as I then gave specific topics I'd like the books to cover, balance of classics and more modern books etc. Collaboration was necessary for me to give details and specifics on exactly what I wanted to help AI make customizable lists that included what I wanted and not just a random, irrelevant list of books that wouldn't work for our educational needs.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Many colleagues don't use AI at all as they don't understand how to use it as a tool or are even scared of it.

AI: Tell me more about that. When you say they're scared of it or don't understand how to use it - what have you observed or heard from them?

User: Older teachers aren't great at implementing new technology and fear AI will eliminate their jobs in the future.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I get frustrated when I have to spend alot of time going back and forth to modify responses if the AI doesn't seem to get what I'm looking for.

AI: What does that back-and-forth look like when it's not going well? Can you describe a specific instance where you found yourself getting stuck in that cycle?

User: It's not great at correlating standards from various areas ( state standards, specific school standards, my personal standards as a teacher) and combining all of that in responses. It is good at giving specific information from a single source but not when combining a variety of factors.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I worry that AI becomes so efficient that it could teach students without a live teacher. I try to stay up to date and find positive ways AI can support me and hope for the best in the future.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision it as removing many of the administrative, repetitive tasks that take up a lot of my time and don't require a "personal" teacher.  I will continue to use it as a tool to support my job and enhance my profession.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI works well for single-source information but struggles when you need it to synthesize multiple standards and requirements.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool in homeschool teaching, especially around differentiating instruction for multiple grade levels, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
