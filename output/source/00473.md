Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No. That all sounds good to me. Let's get started.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I  am a writer so I use it for a lot of things. Mainly in a supportive role. I write both fiction and non-fiction and find it useful for everything from checking grammar and syntax to brain-storming ideas.

AI: That's really interesting that you use it across both fiction and non-fiction writing. 

When you say you use it in a "supportive role" for brainstorming ideas, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does a typical brainstorming session with AI unfold for you?

User: I use it to brainstorm in a variety of ways. So, for example, if I am struggling to work out how to resolve a plot point, or am trying to develop a character I might ask it a series of questions that help me focus my thoughts. It's like having a really good assistant who I can bounce ideas off of.

AI: That's a great analogy - having it as someone to bounce ideas off of. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I love to write so I never ask the AI to do that for me.  The closest I get is when I ask it for advice about whether or not a sentence makes sense or not.  This is particularly the case when I'm writing fiction. I like to use language in a way that pushes the boundaries, so it's good to be able to check whether what I've written is intelligible.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI to check if your boundary-pushing language still comes across clearly to readers. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: No, I collaborate with it throughout – as a sounding-board, I suppose. I don't delegate it to complete any tasks for me, as such. I never lift anything it writes, for example, and use it in my work. It's more like having someone sitting across the desk from me  who I can check in with if I'm in doubt or need to spark off of.

AI: That collaborative, back-and-forth dynamic sounds really valuable for your creative process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I don't have any colleagues. I work alone, which is why AI is such a useful tool for me.

AI: Ah, that makes complete sense - AI filling that role of having someone to check in with when you're working solo.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes I write a sentence or two that attempts to pushes the form, for example, I might use a neologism or irregular syntax. It can be incredibly gratifying when the AI recognises what I am trying to reach for and critiques it a genuinely helpful way.  It can be surprisingly good at understanding my thought process. It's less satisfying is when I try to brainstorm ideas with it. It can be a little obvious sometimes.

AI: That's really insightful - the difference between when AI grasps your creative intentions versus when it falls into predictable patterns.

When you say the brainstorming can be "a little obvious sometimes," can you tell me more about what that looks like? What happens in those moments that makes it feel less useful?

User: I might ask it for some plot ideas for example, that are related to the shell of a story I've provided it with and what it comes back can sometimes feel stale or clichéd. There may be one good idea out of half a dozen that I can work with. Occasionally, there are none.

AI: That's a really helpful distinction - the hit-or-miss nature of creative brainstorming versus the more reliable feedback on your experimental language.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do some work as a commercial copywriter and I think AI is fast making that kind of role redundant. I also work as a journalist and some of that kind of work is being replaced – or at least assisted – by AI. I could use it to write a piece of fiction for me but what would be the point? I write fiction o express myself  and because I love to write.  Does that answer your question?

AI: Yes, that really does - you've drawn a clear line between work that's about expression and passion versus work that's more transactional.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm looking forward to developing an even greater understanding of how I can use it as a collaborative tool. I'm surprised how quickly it's become an integral part of my daily routine and I"m interested in learning how to get even more from it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as that collaborative partner when you're working alone, and the interesting distinction you made between using it for creative expression versus more commercial work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes. Because of how it helps me and how I use it, it gives me greater confidence in my work. This wasn't something that I was expecting from it. As unintentional byproducts go, it's a very welcome one!

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the confidence boost as an unexpected benefit. Thank you for sharing that.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a collaborative creative partner, especially in solo work environments, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtful and detailed your responses have been throughout our conversation.
