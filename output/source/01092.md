Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. I'm ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as an accounts payable clerk and there are several tasks that I do bi weekly or monthly that can be repetitive and I use AI to help me automate these tasks or give me ideas to simplify them and make them quicker to do when they come up. For example. I email 8 assistants about open purchase orders. I take their open PO's and give them to AI along with my notes on each and ask it to put them into an email that summarizes those PO's and ask for a follow up. I also use AI when I have technical questions especially in Google products (sheets, mail, forms, etc.) since we use these at my workplace. I created a spreadsheet that I shared but wanted to protect certain cells, and I asked AI to show me how to do this and change permission settings. I am also in the process of digitizing a lot of our paper forms and working with copious amounts of paper. AI helped me with running scripts to sort and rename several files which has been tremendously helpful. For other digitizing related tasks, I ask AI for assistance

AI: That's really interesting how you've found ways to integrate AI into those recurring tasks. It sounds like you're using it both for streamlining communication and for technical problem-solving.

Tell me more about that email summarization process with the purchase orders. How does that workflow actually play out for you when you're putting together those emails?

User: I have a list of purchase orders that were submitted by a particular person and I export it from our internal source and ask AI to summarize them by vendor and include a friendly message to provide on update on each. I tweak it a little based on how urgent some of the PO's are (such as long outstanding items) and for that specific person, I may have additional AP items to add, so I will ask AI to add another blurb to the email such as "please remember to bring down your deposit too." This makes up the info I send out for my monthly AP check in

AI: That's a clear picture of how you've structured that process. It sounds like AI handles the initial organization and drafting, but you're still very much in control of the nuances and personalization.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do not copy emails verbatim because I like to have my own personal voice. Also, I manually check off items on invoices and PO's to make sure all items were invoiced/received. Most of the time there aren't too many so it isn't a big deal and it would seem cumbersome to ask AI to compare the two documents and confirm that each item is accounted for. I perform most math calculations myself such as when I have to calculate mileage and mileage rates for reimbursements. Much of the paperwork I need to turn in requires me to "show my work" so my supervisor can verify the information and make sure I am calculating the right amounts, so I do this on my own

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're keeping control over tasks where accuracy is critical and where you need to show your process to others. The personal voice in emails is interesting too.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I work on tasks together. I have to verify everything I do myself. I am handling payments and money and its critical that I understand what I'm doing. I may have AI do the "heavy lifting" and I will ask follow up questions and for clarification and more nuances to be added throughout. I never say "here do this" and then just trust that it is all correct. There are some tasks (such as renaming files) that are largely independent to AI but I still check. Longer tasks (such as creating a script in google sheets) are collaborative between me and AI so I can understand and explain to others.

AI: That collaborative approach makes perfect sense given the nature of your work with financial data. It sounds like you maintain oversight while leveraging AI's capabilities.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Most of my colleagues are/were very old fashioned. Doing everything by hand and with a lot of paper and a lot of manual work. The two oldest people (and most old fashioned) recently retired actually, but while they were still working I was always thinking "how can I make this quicker/better?" The workflows they showed me were so tedious and that encouraged me to find better ways to work. The business as a whole is beginning to adopt AI, but within my department, very few people leverage it.

AI: It sounds like you were really motivated to innovate in an environment that was quite traditional. That contrast between the old methods and what you knew could be possible must have been frustrating at times.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was particularly satisfied when I wrote a script in google sheets that had pop up warnings and conditional formatting and real time updates. That was very satisfying to see the final product and then to see it being used throughout the company. A frustrating time was when I had a bunch of scanned documents that I wanted AI to pull the name from, but it was unable to due to the low quality of some of the images or the handwriting or other imperfections in the file. It would pull the name from the wrong line or nothing at all and we could not troubleshoot it to be able to read it. I had to do a lot of manual work afterwards. For the clear files, it worked fine, but it had limitations when trying to read handwriting

AI: That satisfaction from creating something that got adopted company-wide sounds like a real high point - especially in a traditionally manual environment. And the document scanning frustration is such a good example of where the technology still has clear limitations.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: There is a lot of repetitive work to my job, and with the right prompting and infrastructure, it could take over, but someone has to feed it with the information. We get data from several different sources (email, shared drives, physical mail, inter-office mail) and I think organization is a big skill to performing this job correctly. I try to make everything transparent and easy to follow. If AI were to do more of the work, I would be focused on optimizing the work that it does

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - focusing on the organizational and optimization aspects that require human judgment. It sounds like you see yourself evolving into more of a systems designer role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will learn patterns from AI so that I can figure things out a little quicker on my own or know where to troubleshoot. I think AI will be used to create a lot of the content that I see from my employer such as memos and updates and reports. I think I will use it more heavily as I establish a baseline for digitizing documents and then less so. I think I will also have templates to fall back on that will make certain tasks very fast. I have already seen that AI is building my profile in its systems and learns more from me with each prompt so that it offers helpful suggestions to move forward. these may influence my future tasks and goals

AI: That's fascinating how you're noticing AI learning your patterns and building that profile - and how you're thinking about learning from it in return. It sounds like you see it becoming more seamlessly integrated into your workflow over time.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that collaborative approach rather than just delegating tasks completely, and how you're innovating in a traditionally manual environment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I have seen others I work with seemingly use AI blindly. For example, a new form for fundraisers was sent out as well as a follow up financial report that my department needs to review. But some of the questions contradict each other and I can tell by the formatting and the style that it was created with AI. I think that while it is nice to have AI do these things like create a form based on some criteria, people need to closely pay attention to anything they publish as official documents for the business. AI can help at work, but anything that reaches the public or the company as a whole needs to be vetted by real people to avoid making yourself look foolish.

AI: That's such an important observation - the risk of publishing AI-generated content without proper review, especially when it becomes an official company document. It sounds like you've developed a good eye for spotting when something might have been generated without sufficient human oversight.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing collaboration with AI while maintaining critical oversight, and your approach to innovation in a traditional workplace, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
