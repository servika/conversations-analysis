Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I have no questions right now.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for a variety of tasks during my work week. Since I am a High School Engineering Teacher in Texas, I often ask questions related to associating appropriate TEKS with the lessons I am teaching and vise versa. I sometimes ask about creating anchor charts or posters tide to concepts I teach. I also use AI for writing college recommendation letter and other correspondence.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you with both the pedagogical side and the administrative aspects of teaching. 

When you're working on those college recommendation letters, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically approach that task with AI?

User: When I receive a request from a student I will ask the student for a "brag" sheet that highlights their academics, successes, and interests. I will then make a list of highlights of my time with and observations of the student.  With that information I will create a prompt like this: Help me write an exemplary letter of recommendation - (college application) The male student has been in my engineering classes for the past 3 years. Keep the tone less formal than professional. Make sure to incorporate the following information about the student: Academic Information: GPA: 3.85 Test Scores: 92 and 96 average score for major    grades (Sem1 and Sem2)

AP, Honors, or Specialized Classes taken: All 4 years of engineering in high school to achieve my endorsement – Taking AP Calc AB currently

My goals: My main goal is to end up working for a big aeronautics company preferably in the top 5. I want to help society push farther into the universe away from Earth. I want to get a bachelors and possibly masters in Aerospace Engineering

AI: That's a very detailed process - I can see how you're combining your personal observations with the student's own information to create something comprehensive.

Tell me more about that balance between what you provide and what the AI generates. Do you find yourself editing or revising what the AI produces, or does it typically capture what you're looking for on the first try?

User: Yes, I find that the AI often fabricates information or embellishes. I will have to correct these inaccuracies.  If the information sounds too generic I often remove the information. I find that I do not have to modify my personal observations and insights as the AI is typically intuitive enough to effectively integrate my information. One of my biggest issues is AIs typically write these letter too formally. For instance, a recent letter stated, "His dedication to his studies." I felt this was too formal for the context, so I modified the sentence. If the letter is too formal I may just respond with, "Less formal."

AI: That's a fascinating insight about the formality issue - it sounds like you have a pretty specific tone you're aiming for that's somewhere between casual and professional.

When you tell the AI "Less formal," how does it typically respond? Does it adjust in the way you're hoping for, or do you find yourself having to give it more specific guidance about what "less formal" means to you?

User: If the response is not perfect, I usually have enough content between the 2 options to create a useful letter. I don't get very specific at that stage in the conversation.

AI: That makes sense - you're essentially using the two versions to give you a range to work with.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There is nothing I prefer to do myself. If I could collaborate throughout my day with AI I think I would be an even better teacher. I would like to just say, "Hey AI, please grade abc assignment that is in Google Classroom," but LLMs haven't developed to that point yet. Some things are off limits. I do not include student PII in my requests. For example, those recommendation letter requests never have student names or contact information.

AI: That's really thoughtful about protecting student privacy while still leveraging AI's capabilities.

You mentioned wanting to collaborate throughout your day - that's an interesting way to put it. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it handle things independently?

User: I tend to give it all of the information for one task. I may come back to that task later, often in a new conversation.

AI: So you're approaching it more as discrete tasks rather than ongoing collaboration within a single conversation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other teachers using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: I find that AI adoption is slow in education. Most teachers probably don't use it to the level that I do. Often, teachers use these tools for administrative work, like I do. In my normal work environment, our IT department has restrictions and firewalls that limit my interaction and use of AI.

AI: Those IT restrictions sound frustrating, especially when you can see the potential for AI to help with your teaching.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I really like to use ChatGPT plus and Claude in my personal life and would love to use these at work but I do not want to log into these systems because I tend to share personal information I do not want my employer to have access to.  One recent satisfying experience I had was having an LLM create a poster based on information I have been handwriting each year. That's one less thing I have to prepare each year.

AI: That poster example is a great illustration of how AI can take something repetitive off your plate. It sounds like there's a real tension between wanting to use the more advanced AI tools and maintaining that separation between your personal and work digital footprint.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: That's not something I worry about because I already have the foundational skills. Real teaching  and learning come with the interactions I have with my students, and if AI can take the administrative and busy work off my plate, then I will have more time for my students. Each summer, teachers are required to take part in professional development, which can be used to keep my skills sharp.

AI: That's a really confident perspective - focusing on what's uniquely human about teaching while letting AI handle the routine tasks.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: That's a question only the future will reveal. I really like having voice conversations with AI and I could see this being something that would be great to have throughout the school day to validate, elaborate on, or correct what I say. I can see a time when AI begins to build custom profiles on students by subject. This could be utilized to supplement my teaching to provide specialized instruction for each student.

AI: Those are some fascinating possibilities - especially the idea of AI building custom student profiles to personalize instruction.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI could free you up for more meaningful student interactions, and your vision for voice-based AI collaboration throughout the school day.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in education - from the practical challenges with IT restrictions to your vision for personalized student instruction - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the current limitations you're experiencing. Have a great rest of your day!
