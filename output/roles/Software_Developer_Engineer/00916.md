Assistant: Hi there, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Ready to start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: On a typical day I will use ai to help craft messages to potential clients, which can include researching those businesses and their contact information. I will often run strategies by AI to get an alternative opinion, or refine a strategy. This includes refining different ways to send a message/email, finding different/more effective ways of getting information, coming up with different ad ideas etc.
On days designated for building, I use ai primarily to create flutter/js/python code. I will normally have it working with a limited section/scope within a project in order to achieve a specific goal or set of goals I had for that day.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of creative and technical work. You mentioned using AI for both client outreach and coding projects.

When you're working on those coding tasks, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? Are you giving AI the specific requirements and having it generate the code, or is it more of a back-and-forth collaboration as you build?

User: For most of it, since I will be generating code for an existing project, I will typically have a specific goal I want to achieve within that project broken into smaller steps that I will either explain or have a back and forth through the conversation to create the functionality I want. I pretty often allow it to generate the code in the way it wants and verify the code afterwards. It will usually stylize using the surrounding code if I pass any of that through. Does that answer the question?

AI: Yes, that gives me a clear picture - you're breaking down your goals into smaller steps and then letting AI handle the implementation while you verify the results afterward.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Not really, at least not fully. When coming up with ideas/creative systems/writing ideas it often struggles to give something I would use as given. So I have to do this, but I will also run this by AI in case it can produce something that sparks inspiration. And I imagine, I will still do this at least a little bit even if AI gets better that this specifically. I also like to do the company research myself, I'll take pointers from AI web searches but I both have to and enjoy verifying the output and learning about the potential clients.

AI: That's really insightful - so even when AI struggles with the creative work, you still find value in bouncing ideas off it for that spark of inspiration. And it sounds like with the company research, there's both a practical need to verify the information and genuine enjoyment in that discovery process.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'd say it is somewhere about 50/50. Similar to the previous message, I will bounce ideas of it as well as ask it to perform tasks, but I will verify it's findings and use the findings to do things manually. Like further researching a businesses social media, coming up with a message to send to a client, verifying a function works then fixing it manually or passing it back to the AI if it wasn't implemented correctly.

AI: So you've got this fluid mix - sometimes collaborating throughout, sometimes delegating but then verifying and taking it from there. It sounds like verification is a key part of your process regardless of the approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Colleagues or workplace culture do not have any effect on my use of AI

AI: Got it - sounds like you have a lot of autonomy in how you approach your work with AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think my biggest annoyance is asking for something and it will assume I'm asking for something else that's closely related or typically used together. It will often repeat my sentence back to me at the start of the response, but will add words into it that I didn't say. On one hand it has made it clear that it didn't fully understand specifically what I asked, or that I didn't give it enough context (possibly because I didn't know enough about the topic), and on the other hand, I now have to restart the conversation, adjust my prompt and try again hoping it would be more specific. Sometimes this can happen mid conversation, so I can't just restart in a new chat, and have to go through the back forth process of understanding and explaining exactly what I meant. Ideally I would use custom instructions that double checks what I mean when its unclear, but usually I think its a simple request, and then my words get misunderstood to mean something else.
I think in general I'm incredibly satisfied with how models perform on coding tasks. For a specific instance where I was impressed, I gave it top level goal then we created an output spec for a flutter project, we walked through all the pages and functionality we needed at a top level, created a routing table, then had it create the basic functionality of each page. This saved a lot of time and created a base layer of the project to then do specific requests for each page later.

AI: That contrast is really striking - the frustration when AI assumes or adds words you didn't say, especially mid-conversation when you can't easily restart, versus that satisfaction with the Flutter project where you could build systematically from top-level goals down to specific functionality.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes since using AI, instead of developing code/syntax specific skills, I have found myself learning where the limits of the models are. Then this is where I would research myself, have AI help research, verify the code or errors, then repackage the problem back to the AI to help assist. I find it hard to "loose skills" I already have, but I am aware that I might not be fully learning if relying on AI, which is why I will verify the output and ask the AI for explanations on something or provide documentation so I can verify its output. I have coded in languages I do not understand the syntax of but have learned the syntax by focusing on building and asking questions where I don't understand.
Does that answer the question?

AI: Yes, that really does - you're essentially shifting from learning syntax to learning how to work effectively with AI's capabilities and limitations, while still making sure you understand what's happening through verification and asking for explanations.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Right now I am doing a lot of manual outreach, I think it's possible that the next steps are to systematise this somehow and use agents to take care of outreach and and incoming messages with some human verification.

AI: That makes sense - moving from using AI as a tool for crafting individual messages to potentially having it handle entire outreach workflows with you overseeing the process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're shifting from learning syntax to learning AI's limits, and that interesting contrast between the frustration when AI misinterprets your requests versus the satisfaction of that systematic Flutter project build.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's all.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution from syntax learning to understanding AI limitations, the importance of verification in your workflow, and your vision for systematizing outreach will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your day-to-day experiences with such detail. Have a great rest of your day!
