Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm good. Ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have 2 main jobs and I use AI heavily in both. As treasurer of a nonprofit, I use AI heavily for seeking and writing grant applications, fundraising idea generation, creating communications  and marketing materials. As a CPA/ consultant,  I use  AI for research on trends, risk analysis, looking up accounting principles, excel formula help, and to plan my audit travel efficiently.

AI: That's a fascinating range of uses across two very different professional contexts. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for grant writing - what does that process typically look like for you?

User: For grant applications, I upload the info I have about the grant to AI and ask for advice on how to proceed. Do  we qualify? If so, how much should we apply for?  What documents do we need  to present? What are the terms? Make me a list of dates and documents needed and how to apply. Write me a cover letter.  For grants approved, I  upload the grant documents to AI, and ask AI for a detailed summary, and compliance checklist. When preparing the receipts and schedules to request reimbursement under the grant, I submit it to AI and ask if it looks good or what might be questioned/ revised. I ask AI to write me a  cover letter explaining the background of our organization, to submit with the  documentation, etc.

AI: That sounds like a very thorough process where you're getting AI involved at multiple stages. 

When you're working through those grant applications, are you more collaborating back-and-forth with AI throughout each step, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle on its own?

User: I am collaborating. I am not at the point where I can rely fully on AI  so I double check the work.

AI: That makes sense - you're maintaining oversight throughout the process.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: It is not really that I prefer to handle them myself.   I am responsible for the output so I need to confirm everything.

AI: That's a really important distinction - it sounds like responsibility and accountability are key factors in how you approach working with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or practices around you?

User: I am shocked that most colleagues do not embrace AI.

AI: Tell me more about that. What do you see happening with your colleagues that surprises you?

User: It surprises me how fast people my generation have fallen behind with AI, and all their missed opportunities, distrust, and fear .

AI: That sounds like you're seeing quite a contrast between your own experience and theirs.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I am extremely satisfied with letter writing and idea generation/ brainstorming.  This has saved me time  and improved / enhanced quality of my work.  I am frequently frustrated with attempts to make graphics, flyers, visuals, etc.  I rarely get the result I want quickly,  and I think I waste time going back and forth with AI to the point I should have tried to create it myself from scratch in canva or other.

AI: That's a really clear contrast between where AI works well for you and where it doesn't. The back-and-forth struggle with visuals sounds particularly time-consuming.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am not worried about AI taking over. I welcome the time  when it is actually good enough to be more heavily relied upon, because then I can focus my attention on higher level things.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - you're looking forward to that evolution rather than being concerned about it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It is obviously hard to predict. My audit mind needs to be comfortable with the accuracy so I need assurances before I can let go and rely more heavily on AI.

AI: That audit mindset makes complete sense - accuracy and reliability are obviously crucial in your line of work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're collaborating with AI while maintaining oversight, and how you see it as a tool that could eventually free you up for higher-level work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, just that I am very interested in  using AI responsibly. I welcome it and these surveys

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about responsible AI use, the collaborative approach you've developed, and your perspective on generational differences in AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your thoughtful responses and your willingness to participate in this research. Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for such an insightful conversation. Take care!
