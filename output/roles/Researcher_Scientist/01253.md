Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good, let's begin!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent research project I worked on involved drafting a research proposal for a scientific study about how dogs and cats learn communicate with each other within a household. I brainstormed for a while to come to that topic. Then I had to find published scientific research that was related to behavior and forms of communication that have been documented about dogs, cats, and any research related to them communicating with each other and the species coexisting. Following the background research, I had to come up with a specific question that could be tested and I had to make a strategy for how communication between the species could be tracked over time, studied, and accurately documented, as documenting behaviors requires a different approach than gathering and documenting numerical data does, for example. I had to finish up the research proposal by explaining the significance of the research.

AI: That's a fascinating topic - the communication between dogs and cats in households sounds like it would involve some really complex behavioral observations.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I mainly only used AI tools to help with the beginning stages of my research project, where I was brainstorming many topics related to animals to get to this topic, as well as trying to narrow down what exactly I wanted to learn from the study. I think I occasionally used AI tools to help with clarity/conciseness in my phrasing and proof-reading, also.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for brainstorming and narrowing down your research focus - what did that interaction look like?

User: I started out by asking the AI to help me think of animal-related topics that could be used for a research project. I don't remember specifics about the conversation anymore, but I do remember the AI giving some good ideas for species and potential topics. Eventually, I settled on my topic because it was the most practical and realistic topic that I came up with, with the help of the AI. I also remember asking the AI for help incorporating other feedback I had received, while sticking to the process and research methods I wanted to use, by explaining my vision for the study and asking the AI for help incorporating what other scientists had mentioned throughout the different drafts of my project, without losing my main focuses and goals for the project.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. For those brainstorming and feedback incorporation tasks, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach - what made you think "I'll try AI for this"?

User: Before AI, I would just have to try to figure out if/how to incorporate feedback on my own, or maybe ask friends for help with reviewing feedback and incorporating good feedback in a way that made sense, but my friends aren't scientists, so there's only so much they can really help with. I thought it would be good to ask AI for help with some of these situations because sometimes, it can be hard to reflect on your own work and find things that could be tweaked or changed because in my mind, I understand everything I want to get from the research and I can "see the vision," but others might not quite be imagining things the same way I am or may be glazing over certain aspects that don't seem very relevant to them, but with my background knowledge, I know they are very important aspects of the research. Being able to put all my thoughts, ideas, and background details into an AI model, along with parts of my paper and feedback I received, and being able to say, "How can I make this aspect of my project more clear and easier for people outside the project to understand if they were reading this?" or "How can I make it more clear to readers that this part is an essential part of the research?" is really helpful, and isn't really possible to do with things other than AI.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI filled a specific gap where you needed someone who could understand the technical context but also provide that outside perspective on clarity. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the literature review, developing your methodology, or explaining the significance - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: Literature review is definitely a topic I would have liked to use AI to help with, because I can envision AI really being able to streamline background research by finding literature that is relevant to specific topics and picking out the relevant information much more quickly than a human would be able to. What stopped me in this case was that AI wouldn't have access to a lot of the scientific research I was using because the databases are behind paywalls, university websites, etc.
As for explaining methodology and significance, I probably used AI a bit to make sure my project sounded clear, concise, and kept a professional, scientific tone throughout (I don't quite remember specifics), but for this specific topic, I didn't need as much help with actual brainstorming of the methodology and significance as I might need for other topics. I think AI could be great to use for help with methodology or explaining significance, so it wasn't due to any potential shortcomings in AI that I didn't happen to use it much here.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the paywall barrier is a really practical limitation. You mentioned you did use AI a bit for tone and clarity in those sections. 

When you've used AI for brainstorming topics or incorporating feedback, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: I knew enough about the topic and the plans I had for my research to know whether or not I wanted to incorporate what AI provided in those situations. I didn't use AI for finding specific information or making claims/statements I didn't already have backed up with scientific sources, so it was really just a matter of using AI for advice and to guide my thought process. So, in my case, it wasn't really about "verifying" or "validating" what the AI came up with, it was more-so just a question of if I wanted to incorporate some of the ideas the AI came up with, or if it could give me an idea for changing phrasing or structure for clarity/

AI: That's a great distinction - using AI more as a thinking partner rather than an information source. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: As we talked about earlier, I think the literature review process could be an amazing way to use AI and I hope, in the future, that it could be possible to use AI in this way- it would save so much time digging through articles that look like they might be helpful, but in the end, are not, or maybe only have a tiny bit of relevant info. Of course, I would still want to verify that the sources found by AI are correct, relevant, and ensure the AI hasn't hallucinated or extrapolated information from sources- I would always fact-check, just in case. But again, I'm not sure how realistic that is, knowing that paywalls and other barriers exist that would simply not allow the AI to access the sources it needs to.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a thinking partner rather than an information source, and the practical barriers around literature access were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: That is all I can think of for now! I definitely think in science fields, it is important for scientists to not rely on AI to do all their work for them, but as you said, it can be incorporated as a great thinking partner to make the entire process go a bit more smoothly and to have someone there to bounce ideas off of and get advice from when needed! I hope my feedback is useful!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about AI serving as a thinking partner - helping with brainstorming, incorporating feedback, and providing that outside perspective on clarity - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The distinction you made between using AI for guidance versus information sourcing was especially valuable.

Your point about the literature review challenges also highlights an important gap between what would be most useful and what's currently accessible due to practical barriers like paywalls.

This has been incredibly helpful for our research. If you have any questions about this study or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
