Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: At times, I use AI to help me with diary planning by outlining my availability and the tasks, along with their estimated times.

AI: That's interesting - using AI for diary planning and scheduling sounds really practical. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're working with AI on your diary planning, what does that interaction typically look like?

User: So, I'll provide a list of jobs, the estimated times and then the time availability I have. For example, I might say I'm free from 8.00-12.00 and then from 2.00-3.45 and ask the AI to help me plan my day the most effectively. I usually do this the night before, so that I can start my tasks first thing in the morning. I also use AI in other ways - do you want me to tell you more about that or do you want to know anything else about this one?

AI: I'd love to hear about the other ways you use AI at work. What are some of those other tasks you turn to AI for?

User: At times, when I'm writing reports, I find that I can't quite phrase things effectively, so I'll often put in the part I'm struggling with and ask it to improve it. I usually specify that it needs to keep the langauge simple enough that a non-expert could understand it. I make sure that I replace any names with an X to keep things anonymous.

AI: That makes sense - having AI help refine your writing while keeping it accessible. 

When you're working with AI on report writing, do you find yourself going back and forth with it to get the phrasing just right, or do you typically get what you need from that first interaction?

User: So I don't use it for the whole report as the reports I write are usually around 30 pages long and each report is individual to the person I'm working with. Instead I just take short sections and ask for help. Sometimes it might just be a sentence that I need rephrasing or at other times it might be a few paragraphs. It's never usually more than three paragraphs. I often find that the first response gives me the result I'm looking for, but occasionally we'll go back and forth to tweak it.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - keeping it to specific sections rather than entire reports. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: If I'm creating resources to use in my tuition sessions, I tend to create those myself. It's only because when I've asked AI to create them for me in the past, they've never quite been able to create exactly what I'm looking for, so I find it quicker to make them myself.

AI: That makes perfect sense - when the back-and-forth would take longer than just doing it yourself. 

What is it about those tuition resources that makes them challenging for AI to get right? Is it something specific about your teaching style or your students' needs?

User: It just didn't seem to grasp what I was asking it to create. I wanted it to create an alphabet arc template but with squares for my students to fill in, instead of the letters of the alphabet already on it. I even gave it a draft image of what I wanted but it just didn't seem to understand. Instead it wrote out the alphabet in 4 rows.

AI: That's a great example of where the visual and spatial understanding just didn't click, even with an image reference.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you tend to give it specific, focused tasks rather than collaborating throughout an entire project. Is that accurate?

User: Most of my interactions focus on specific, focused tasks but there are times when I use it collaboratively to help me explore ideas. For example, when I decided that I wanted to create some products that would generate passive income based on my area of expertise. It helped me to brainstorm and narrow down what I could create. There are also times when I've asked it for suggestions of how to create more of a work-life balance seen as I work from home and we've worked collabortively on that.

AI: That's really interesting - so you use it both ways depending on what you need. The passive income brainstorming and work-life balance conversations sound much more exploratory and collaborative.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned working from home, I'm curious about whether there are any spoken or unspoken expectations around AI use in your field.

User: So I work for myself, although I have a range of colleagues who also run their own businesses and part of our focus in our assessor role is that we should be producing individualised reports, that are specifically tailored to the individual. As a result of that mindset,  I tend to ask AI for support in tweaking/rephrasing parts of my report rather than help with the whole thing. So I guess you could say that there's an unspoken expectation that if AI is used, it should only be used minimally.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a support tool while maintaining the individual focus that's so important in your assessment work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, the alphabet arc example that I shared above made me feel really frustrated - I think I spent about an hour trying to explain what I wanted and giving examples and it just couldn't grasp what I was asking it to do.

AI: That hour of trying to explain the alphabet arc template does sound incredibly frustrating! 

On the flip side, has there been a time when using AI left you feeling particularly satisfied with how it helped you accomplish something?

User: Yes, there was part of a report that I was struggling with. I knew what I needed to say but what I'd written down didn't sound right, in fact it sounded really complicated. AI helped me to rephrase it in a way that was coherent but accessible to a non-professional audience.

AI: That's such a great contrast - the satisfaction of getting exactly the right phrasing versus the frustration of not being understood at all.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is - I'd started a computer programming course. It was only a beginners one and something that I wanted to learn about mainly out of interest rather than it being something I would use in my current business. I got so far through it but then had a family member told me how they'd got AI to create a website for them and how it had written the code almost instantly and adjusted the site to fit in with his requests. After that, I didn't really feel inspired to continue with the course and decided to pursue other avenues of learning that interested me more.

AI: That's such an honest example of how AI's capabilities can shift our learning priorities. It sounds like it made you reassess where to invest your time.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: I'd like to explore how AI can automate tasks in my current business to free up time. For example, sending email replies, checking that all the paperwork I require has been completed and returned prior to me booking in assessments. I support using it as a Virtual Assistant. I'm also looking to develop my YouTube channel, so I'd like to explore how it can help me plan scripts or brainstorm ideas. I also see it having a bigger role in helping me to increase my passive income streams by continuing to help me plan and create products.

AI: Those are some really exciting possibilities - from automating the administrative side to creative brainstorming for your YouTube channel. It sounds like you're thinking about AI as a way to scale different aspects of your business.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found that balance between using AI as a focused tool for specific tasks while maintaining the individualized approach that's so important in your assessment work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically - from the practical diary planning to the collaborative brainstorming, and even the frustrations with tasks it couldn't quite grasp - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
