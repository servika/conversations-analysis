Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use AI to create content for my website. This ranges from helping me draft a page setup to a blog post to making sure my FAQ covers everything. I've also used it to help me evaluate the page layout and make improvements.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you across different aspects of your website work. 

When you say you use it to help draft page setups and blog posts, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: Yes. So my husband and I own a wildlife exclusion company. I do the office/phone/booking aspects of the job while he does the fieldwork. I ask AI questions like "what's a good way to set up a landing page", "here's my current page layout, am I missing any content", "can you improve this blog post", "can you draft a blog post about X (right now it's the end of bat season so a lot of my blogs are focused on this) but make it SEO friendly and remember that our company values humane practices", etc. From there, I'll take the content/suggestions and work with AI to improve it. Things like "make a little more SEO friendly" or "include a CTA", "that doesn't really fit our company, try again", etc.

AI: That gives me a really clear picture of your process - it sounds like there's quite a bit of back-and-forth refinement happening. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: To be honest, I love writing. I would honestly prefer to write the content and blog posts myself, but I simply don't have time. I have a 4 year old daughter and other priorities so I divvy out tasks where I can. Plus, AI can draft a really good blog post in just a minute or two. It takes me much longer.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - the time factor clearly plays a big role in those decisions. 

When you do use AI for these writing tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: collab for sure. If it's a new model that's unfamiliar with me or my husband's business, I explain what we do, our core principles, and a bit about our company that way the model has a good basis to work from. If the model knows who I am or I'm returning to our conversation, I dive in so to speak. But long story short, collab for sure even if I delegate a full task like "draft a blog post about X", I'm still going to look for ways to improve it.

AI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense, especially with the context you need to provide about your business values and practices.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since it's you and your husband's business, I'm curious how that dynamic plays out.

User: My husband also teaches college level history and AI has been instrumental for his job. He has had to learn the ins and outs and how to identify potential AI drafted work (students must write their own papers, not AI) and also uses AI to filter out work that isn't written by the student. His colleagues regularly discuss AI. For me, the need to save time and put that energy elsewhere led me to AI. Again, it takes me an hour to draft a blog post, AI can do it within a minute. After a 10 minute conversation or under, I have a valuable piece. I work from home so I do not have influence within my workspace. My husband and I do regularly discuss it though.

AI: It's fascinating how you both use AI in such different ways - him for detection and evaluation, you for content creation. The time savings aspect really seems central to your experience.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes. As I said, my husband and I co-own a small wildlife exclusion company. We have 2 other employees. One does fieldwork and the other (his wife) is supposed to do office work but does not. She created a website for us and published it... with placeholder text. I had no idea until we kept getting marketing calls talking about our site. I had assumed that she had filled it all out. Nope. Anyways, I was now in a rush to write an entire website before Google punished it or customers got the wrong idea about our business. What probably would have taken me days to fix was done in a matter of hours through AI's assistance.

AI: Wow, that's quite a situation to find yourself in - having to essentially rebuild your entire website content under pressure. That must have been both stressful and then relieving when AI helped you get it sorted so quickly.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is. I spent 10+ years as a freelance writer drafting content for websites, eBooks, etc. I also have a master's in literature. I work to maintain my writing skills (typically through creative means), but AI has already largely replaced my field (freelance content creation). Why pay someone when you can get a chat model to draft similar content for free in less time? However, the ability to write and understand will never stop being valuable. Instead of using my skills to draft content of my own, I use it to critique and improve AI's content.

AI: That's a really thoughtful adaptation - using your writing expertise to elevate AI's output rather than competing with it. It sounds like you've found a way to leverage your skills differently.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine that AI will continue to grow in its ability and in the future I likely won't even need a back and forth conversation- it will just produce something that needs no improvements.

AI: That's an interesting vision - moving toward AI that requires less iteration from you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've adapted your writing expertise to work with AI rather than against it, and how the time pressures of running a business with family responsibilities have shaped your approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that covers it, thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency needs with maintaining professional skills, and how AI fits into the realities of running a small business while managing family life, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
