Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI almost every day for creative writing.  I use it to write emails, Instagram post captions, product listings, and other content for my website.

AI: That sounds like AI plays a pretty central role in your content creation. When you're working on these different types of writing - emails, Instagram captions, product listings, website content - could you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I will attempt a very rough draft of what I am trying to accomplish and try to give as many details as possible and then say "can you help me make this sound better"

AI: That's interesting - so you're starting with your own rough draft first. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, I prefer to handle accounting, taxes, and analytics on my own.  What makes these different is that I am more worried about making a mistake on them.

AI: That makes sense - the stakes feel different with financial and analytical work. When you do use AI for your creative writing tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it your rough draft and let it handle the refinement independently?

User: No, I definitely have to collaborate.  Sometimes it is my fault because I dont feel I gave AI enough details to write what I am trying to accomplish.  In this case I will go back and try again with more detail.  If I feel I did give enough detail and it still didnt turn out the way I want, I will say something like "I dont like this, can you please make it sound more casual" or "can you try again".

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth sounds like a key part of your process. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes some, but we are all a little skeptical.

AI: Tell me more about that skepticism - what are you and your colleagues skeptical about when it comes to using AI at work?

User: Not that it would replace our job, but that we can sometimes do a better job than AI can.  Or I don't want it to seem or sound obvious that AI was used.

AI: That concern about maintaining authenticity in your work sounds important to you. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes I do get frustrated a lot.  Sometimes I feel like the first response that AI gives is always the best option.  If I try to collaborate, sometimes it ends up coming out worse.

AI: That's a really interesting observation - that the first response is often the strongest. When you find yourself in that situation where the collaboration makes it worse, what do you think is happening? Is it something about how you're giving feedback, or does it feel like the AI is misunderstanding what you're looking for?

User: The AI is misunderstanding

AI: That must be frustrating when you're trying to refine something and it moves further from what you want. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes I would consider and am open to it

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: To be honest, I would have to do more research.  All I can think to use it for is creative writing, but I know there are way more ways I could be using it, such as marketing, leads, Ads, accounting, analytics, organization,

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that tension between wanting to collaborate to improve the output, but sometimes finding that the first response was actually the strongest.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thats all I can think of at the moment

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative process - especially that interesting dynamic where the first response is often the best, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining authenticity in your work - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
