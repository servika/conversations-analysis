Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: It sounds nice. Lets start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for a lot of jobs. Actually, I feel that I have a really good developer coach, a content creator, a photographer, a secretary, and many more!
Some of the tasks that I use for are:

As a researcher, I use AI tools to organize presentations, to understand scientific papers faster, to answer my questions about bureaucratic issues, and much more.

As a programmer, It helps me a lot in speeding up code generation and debugging. This is very helpful as I can deliver high-quality code much faster.

Also I use it a lot for content creation, for example, for the creation of an article about my new mobile application,  or for PDF and PowerPoint editing

AI: That's a fascinating range of roles you've described AI filling! I'm particularly intrigued by your comparison to having a team of specialists at your disposal.

When you mention using AI to understand scientific papers faster - could you walk me through what that process actually looks like for you? How does AI help you engage with those papers?

User: Well, a creation of a scientific paper includes research of relative work in the field.  

So, I read several publications from SOTA on this topic. In the past, I had to spend a lot of time understanding the main points of each paper. Now I just attach the file (which is usually a PDF) and it gives me a complete summary of each publication that interests me. It also organizes them very nicely so that they are quite understandable for me and in my native language!

Obviously before I transfer something to my own publication, I confirm that it is in the paper it read as I still can't trust AI for something so important

AI: That's really interesting - you've found a way to accelerate the initial screening process while still maintaining your own verification standards.

When you say you "can't trust AI for something so important" and need to confirm details before using them in your own work - tell me more about that balance. How do you decide which parts of AI's help you trust immediately versus which parts require your double-checking?

User: When it comes to code, AI has earned my trust. So when producing code, I usually add what it produces to mine. In this case, even if it makes a mistake, it won't be serious, because when I run the code and see that there is a problem, I will identify it and fix it.
However, when someone makes a scientific publication, things are not so simple. What they write must be correct and well documented. If they write that another publication reports something that ultimately does not apply, then this is a serious mistake, and it can call into question their scientific work. Therefore, even if the AI reports something, the researcher must confirm it from the original source.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've developed different trust levels based on the consequences of potential errors. Code errors reveal themselves quickly through testing, but research errors can have lasting professional implications.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I don't see a reason not to use it as I always want to save time at work

AI: That's a clear efficiency mindset! It sounds like you approach AI as a tool that can enhance most aspects of your work.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, working back and forth, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I use it as a collaboration. 
For example, in my scientific publications, it can't produce an entire scientific publication on its own with just a prompt, but it can make me complete it much faster.

Also in coding, it can't give me a complete project from scratch but it can give me very good code snippets or help me integrate frameworks more easily.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really natural - like having a skilled partner who handles specific components while you maintain overall direction and integration.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself adapting your AI usage based on how others around you approach these tools?

User: As AI changes rapidly, we are vigilant and when a tool comes out that has significant added value and someone from the team discovers it first, they share it with others.

AI: That's a nice collaborative approach to AI discovery within your team. It sounds like there's an open culture of sharing useful tools.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It was when we had a bug in a project. The AI found what was wrong immediately. This gave us great joy as a problem was solved in 5 minutes while the estimate was that it might take us 3 hours

AI: That's such a dramatic time savings - going from a 3-hour estimate to 5 minutes must have felt incredible! 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or do you approach it differently?

User: So far, because of AI, I have a better job with much better money, so, I see AI as a partner

AI: That's a really positive outcome - it sounds like AI has actually enhanced your career prospects rather than threatening them.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular ways?

User: I believe it will become even more effective to the point where it will be noticeable to the everyday citizen and will improve their daily lives. This makes me feel that it will provide me with even more opportunities for work as we address this area.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has become like having a team of specialists, and how you've developed different trust levels based on the consequences of potential errors.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner, the different trust levels you've developed for different types of work, and how it's actually enhanced your career opportunities will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great day!
