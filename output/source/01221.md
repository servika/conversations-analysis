Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds great, I'm ready!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I regularly work with my students on creating research projects they can complete. I use this in the disciplines of ecology but also field studies in botany and ecosystem ecology. At the beginning stages, we work with AI to help organize or more efficiently look for scholarly articles that can help support our work. Once we are ready, we have worked with AI to help finalize our experimental design (think variables, number of replicates, controls, etc.). Once an experiment is deployed we've used AI to start editing our methods and have used it to help identify what statistical tests make the most sense to run on our samples. While I'm sure AI can help with data analysis, I usually use a different program for it, but occasionally use AI for the code I need to run the statistical analysis. Lastly, we use AI to help edit our final product (i.e. research papers, checking stats, etc.) and clean things up.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview - it sounds like you've integrated AI across almost every stage of your research process. 

Tell me more about that initial stage where you use AI to organize and look for scholarly articles. What does that actually look like in practice?

User: This could be as simple as looking for ideas about how certain organisms interact with one another and finding the citation for whatever the AI output is. For instance, I could request something like this: "Please explain how different diatom taxa could be found in waterways with different nutrient regimes and please cite your sources from scholarly articles"

AI: That's a really specific example, thank you. So you're essentially using AI as a starting point to identify relevant research areas and then tracking down the actual citations it provides.

When you get that response about diatom taxa and nutrient regimes with citations, how do you decide whether to trust and follow up on what the AI has given you versus using your traditional literature search methods?

User: I'm currently at the stage with AI where I won't take anything wholly from AI, rather, use it as a starting point to follow up on and rework, while lessening some of the load. Any citations that would be given by the AI I would absolutely follow up on, but what is nice is the starting point. Another way I could use AI is uploading PDFs of several potentially related scholarly articles and asking AI to summarize or look for certain ideas within the PDFs.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using it as a research accelerator rather than a replacement for your own scholarly judgment. 

When you mention uploading PDFs and asking AI to look for certain ideas within them - can you give me a specific example of how that's worked for you? What kind of ideas or patterns were you looking for across those papers?

User: I could upload PDFs and have AI organize by data/results. For instance, I could upload 10 papers and say "which of these papers found that diatom distribution varies dependent on nutrients and what species seem to be indicators of polluted water?"

AI: That sounds like a powerful way to synthesize findings across multiple studies quickly. 

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't used AI yet - you mentioned you usually use a different program for data analysis rather than AI. What's kept you from trying AI more extensively in that area?

User: I am quite nervous to handover all the computing power to AI since it is not as robust yet (at least I'm not confident it is). For instance, with an ANOVA, there are several conditions the data need to meet before an ANOVA could properly be ran, and I usually do this manually (checking for normality, residuals vs. estimates, etc.) before running the test itself. In short, I don't trust AI to say "your data do not meet the requirements for ANOVA, therefore I recommend running a Kruskal Wallis instead".

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the statistical assumptions and diagnostic checks are so critical to getting valid results. It sounds like you need that level of methodological rigor that you're not confident AI can reliably provide yet.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: I think AI could be a powerful tool when it comes to statistics and experimental design. I think that is where I'd see myself using it the most.

AI: That's fascinating - those are exactly the areas where you expressed the most caution earlier. 

Tell me more about what would need to change for you to feel comfortable using AI for statistics and experimental design. What would give you confidence that it could handle those critical methodological decisions reliably?

User: This is likely a two way street. I'd likely have to rip off the bandaid and use it more, while also checking to see if the results are accurate. Since this replicates my work (and I'm in the business of working smarter not harder, I haven't wanted to check AI's work yet.

AI: That's a really honest insight - the catch-22 of needing to invest time to validate AI's work when the whole appeal is saving time in the first place.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as a research accelerator while maintaining that critical scholarly judgment was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Are there areas in which you think AI could be used where I might not yet be using it in my research?

AI: That's a great question, and I appreciate you turning the tables on me! But as the interviewer here, I'm really focused on learning from your expertise and experiences rather than making suggestions. 

What I'm most curious about is - when you think about your research process, are there any pain points or time-consuming tasks that you haven't yet considered trying AI for? Maybe areas where you think "there has to be a better way to do this"?

User: organization and formatting of citations would be a good one here. I have not tried to use AI for this, though I'm not sure what this would look like.

AI: That's a really practical area that could save a lot of time! Citation formatting and organization can be so tedious.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point while maintaining that critical verification step - and that honest reflection about the time investment needed to validate AI's statistical work - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your perspective as someone who's thoughtfully integrating AI across multiple research stages while maintaining rigorous standards has been incredibly valuable.
