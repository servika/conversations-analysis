Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great, let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So, I work for a local news website. My role is quite multifaceted, I essentially run the admin of the website, dealing with any emails. I also am responsible for bringing in sales and advertising revenue, and also write some articles. I use ai in some aspect for all of this. In terms of emails, I have recently found Outlook's co-pilot useful for drafting emails quickly. In terms of sales, I use ai to search for potential businesses I can reach out to in the local area for advertising. In terms of my actual writing, I use ai for research, and occasionally to check a finished article for mistakes and any ideas about how it could be structured better.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across such a diverse range of tasks. I'm curious to dig a bit deeper into one of those areas. 

When you mention using AI to search for potential businesses for advertising outreach, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like for you?

User: One thing that I like to do is run a deep research in chat gpt, so I will write a specific prompt about what im looking for, an example would estate agents within West London. I also find it useful to ask ai to write the deep research prompt for before I activate its deep research setting.

AI: That's a clever approach - having AI help you craft the research prompt itself before diving into the deep research. 

When you get those results back about estate agents in West London, what do you typically do with that information? How do you move from the AI-generated list to actually making contact with those businesses?

User: With the deep research prompt, I will often ask the ai to also provide relevant email addresses. However, these are not always that accurate, so I double check them. I will then email the person at the businesses, and sometimes use ai to help me draft that email as well.

AI: So you're doing that verification step to check the email addresses - that suggests you've learned where AI tends to be reliable and where it needs that human oversight.

When you use AI to help draft those outreach emails to the businesses, how much of the actual email ends up being your own words versus what the AI generates?

User: I would say its around a 50/50 split. As I use AI quite a lot, and see a lot of emails and copy from businesses, I feel I can now tell very easily and quickly if something has been written by AI. So I always try to tailor my emails at least a little so it doesnt seem its been written by AI without any editing whatsoever, as I feel this just makes you look lazy.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - recognizing that completely unedited AI text can come across as impersonal or lazy. It sounds like your experience with AI has actually made you more attuned to spotting AI-generated content in general.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think its important when writing to try and limit AI use as much as possible. Writing is an art, and if everything ends up being written by AI, i would view it as a problem.

AI: That's a compelling perspective - viewing writing as an art form that deserves to be preserved. 

Can you tell me more about how you draw that line in practice? When you're working on an article, what specific parts do you make sure to keep as your own work versus where you might let AI assist?

User: For example, I would never ask AI to write an entire article, cos if you're doing this, whats the point, we might as well surrender to the computers now. I also think its best to try and limit asking it to use any metaphors or turns of phrase, as this is inherently human, and should remain that. I would let AI assist in grammar checking, and perhaps giving a review of the article at the end and asking if the structure work, and if it would appeal to its intended audience.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making - keeping the creative, inherently human elements like metaphors and turns of phrase for yourself, while using AI more for technical review and structural feedback.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I've tried to delegate it work on complete and large tasks in the past, but I find it still largely struggles with this. I find it to be much more successful and accurate when you work through a project with it step by step, so you can be as specific as possible with what you're trying to achieve.

AI: That's really insightful - you've discovered that breaking things down into smaller, specific steps works better than trying to hand off entire projects.

Can you give me an example of how you might work through a project step by step with AI? What does that collaboration actually look like in practice?

User: So for example, I was looking for a way to build an entirely new CRM from scratch in google sheets for our business. This was a huge project, and without the help of AI I would have no idea with how to achieve all the technical things I wanted to. But, by using chat gpt, using screen shots of what I'd done, describing very specifically what I was after, it helped me build a working and automated CRM for our business that saves me hours every week.

AI: That sounds like a really substantial project that had a meaningful impact on your daily work. The fact that it's now saving you hours every week is impressive.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with how others at your organization are using these tools?

User: No, not really. The team at our work is very small, its the editor, and me essentially, she is somewhat clueless with regards to AI so doesn't use it her self but trusts me to.

AI: So you're essentially pioneering AI use at your organization - that puts you in an interesting position of having a lot of autonomy in how you integrate these tools.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: As previously mentioned, upon completion of the working CRM, I was delighted. My boss was impressed as well, and it contributed towards me achieving a payrise. With some other projects however, I have found it to be frustrating. For example, I was trying to get it to automate a project where emails from clients would be automatically put into google docs, each business having one google sheet with all the communications in it. Chat GPT told me that this was very possible, but as we worked through the task, it quickly became apparent that it was way more complex than the AI had originally led me to believe, and as I tried to tell the ai this it seemed to become increasingly confused, but insisted it could do it. In the end, I abandoned the project and wasted hours on it.

AI: That's such a telling contrast - the CRM success that even led to a raise versus the email automation project that became a frustrating time sink. It sounds like AI initially oversold its capabilities on that second project.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not entirely sure what you mean, could you re-phrase?

AI: Sure! What I'm getting at is - since you use AI for things like research, email drafting, and technical projects, do you ever worry about your own abilities in those areas getting rusty from not practicing them as much? Or do you think about making sure you stay sharp at doing certain things without AI's help?

User: Yes, this is something I have been thinking about a little more in recent times. Whilst my workflows and efficiency have definitely improved with AI, I do worry about the cognitive effect it might be having on me.

AI: Can you tell me more about what you mean by the cognitive effect? What kinds of changes have you noticed or are concerned about?

User: I worry that as I'm increasingly challenging my brain less and less to problem solve, I might be losing the ability to think critically in the same way I used to be. A similar example is when I was younger I used to read vociferously, but as I grew older and became more exposed to instagram reels/tik toks etc, I know find it quite difficult to concentrate on a good book as my attention span is damaged. I worry this could also be the case with AI, if i was to conduct an in depth research project without the use of AI, I worry that i'd be able to.

AI: That's a really thoughtful comparison - the way your reading habits changed with social media and how AI might be affecting your research abilities in a similar way. It sounds like you're quite aware of this potential trade-off.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: If you had asked me six months ago, I'd have said i would use it more and more and more. Now however, I will definitely continue to use it, but I'm a little more mindful with how I do so - both for my own cognitive function and general unreliability from the AI.

AI: That shift in perspective over just six months is really interesting - moving from enthusiastic adoption to more mindful, selective use.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining the human elements in writing and your honest reflection on the cognitive effects you've noticed.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that just about covers, but just a final note that it seems strange that even with the release of Chat GPT 5, it seems less reliable than previous models, perhaps this is a sign that the rise of AI will be not be as inevitable as I previously thought.

AI: That's a fascinating observation about ChatGPT 5 seeming less reliable despite being newer - and how that's shifted your thinking about AI's trajectory. That kind of real-world experience with the tools can definitely change one's perspective on where this is all heading.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency gains with cognitive concerns, the importance of keeping human creativity in writing, and your hands-on experience with both AI successes and failures will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you've reflected on both the benefits and the potential downsides - that nuanced perspective is exactly what makes these conversations so valuable.

User: ok brilliant, can I just leave the chat now to end this task?

AI: Yes, absolutely! You can just leave the chat now. Thank you again for participating in this research - your insights were really valuable.
