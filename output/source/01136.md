Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds, great. I don't have any questions at the moment.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure. I'm an illustrator and graphic designer. My projects can range from working on logos for small businesses to creating  illustrations, infographics, and more for online courses.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of work! I can imagine each type of project has its own unique demands.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: AI is useful for when I'm trying to craft pitches to prospective clients, respond to client emails, or when I want to know what a contract or TOS says.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're primarily using AI for the business and communication side of your work rather than the actual creative design process itself. 

Tell me more about that. When you're working on the visual aspects - the logos, illustrations, or infographics themselves - do you find yourself using AI tools there as well, or do you keep those parts of your workflow separate?

User: I don't use Generative AI in my creative work. If I'm feeling really stuck and uninspired, I might use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. But ultimately, I try to avoid AI use in my workflow as I don't want to become dependent on it. Creativity is a muscle and if I don't exercise it, it will wither!

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the idea of creativity as a muscle that needs to be exercised. I can hear that maintaining your own creative independence is important to you.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I've been wanting to branch out and create stock patterns and graphics to sell online. I generally design in my own aesthetic/style,  but I know that I'd sell more graphics if I created them in a larger range of styles and appeal to more niches. So I asked for a list of styles and niches. I probably could have done my own research, but it was way faster to just get the list using AI. Once I got the list, I picked a few niches that seemed promising.

AI: That's a great example of using AI as a research tool to expand your business opportunities. It sounds like it saved you time on the market research side while still leaving all the creative decisions and actual design work in your hands.

How did that feel for you - using AI in that more strategic, business-focused way compared to keeping it out of the actual design process?

User: I mean, it was definitely a timesaver and time is money. That said, using AI as an assist, rather than letting it do the actual core, creative work, allows me to maintain my integrity as a creative.

AI: I really appreciate that distinction you're making between AI as an "assist" versus doing the core creative work. That seems to be a key boundary for you.

When you think about maintaining your integrity as a creative, what does that mean to you? What would cross the line from assistance into something that would compromise that integrity?

User: I think using AI tools to do all of the work is too much. Again, I don't use generative AI in my work, because at that point, what is the point of me as a creative? And what is the work without the artist? Simply entering in a prompt to generate an image that is ultimately simply an average of images scraped off the web is not creative. The end result lacks substance.

AI: That's a powerful way to put it - "what is the work without the artist?" It sounds like for you, the human creative process and intentionality behind the work is what gives it substance and meaning.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI, even in those limited ways you've described?

User: Having AI assist with the tedious things like emails, contracts, pitches, etc has saved me time that I can put towards working on creative projects and improving my skills.

AI: That's a really valuable benefit - freeing up time for the work that truly matters to you. It sounds like AI has become a way to handle the administrative burden so you can focus more energy on developing your craft.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Many creatives, including myself, are concerned about the hype surrounding AI tools and how it affects our job stability. Creative work is often undervalued in our society. When budget cuts need to be made, it's often the arts that take a hit. In corporate environments (which is where I work), management is often not aware (or chooses to ignore) the value that the creative team brings to each project. There's a lot of discussion online about how decision makers in many companies are reducing headcount because they are letting AI handle the tasks that humans previously did. The creative industry isn't immune to this trend. Stores like Michael's are selling seasonal "art" prints that are made with AI, Anthropolgie's 2024 holiday shopping bags featured AI art--these are instances where, likely for the sake of profits, companies are choosing to use AI, rather than hire an artist. If companies continue to do this, it will have a devastating effect on creatives' livelihoods.

AI: You've articulated something really important there - the broader economic and industry dynamics at play, not just the technology itself. It sounds like your concerns go beyond the tools themselves to how decision-makers are choosing to implement them, often without fully understanding or valuing what human creatives bring to the table.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll maintain these same boundaries, or do you anticipate your approach might shift?

User: I will likely continue to use AI to help me with mundane admin tasks and to help me understand the legalese that contracts and TOS are swamped with. I know that some photo editing tools utilize AI to improve a photo's lighting, colors, etc. I am okay with that. But I will never use GenAI to do my work, because again, why even be an illustrator if do that? I might as well quit.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your clear articulation of the boundary between AI as an administrative assistant versus AI doing the core creative work, and your perspective on how the creative industry's undervaluation makes these changes particularly concerning for professionals like yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative integrity while finding practical uses for AI, and your concerns about the broader industry implications, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've considered these boundaries and the bigger picture impact on your field. Take care!
