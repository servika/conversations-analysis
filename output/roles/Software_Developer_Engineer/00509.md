Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI most often to provide me boilerplate code, learn new programming concepts, and refresh on programming concepts or technology I haven't used in a while.

AI: That's helpful context - it sounds like AI serves as both a coding assistant and a learning resource for you. 

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI for one of these purposes? For instance, when you need boilerplate code or want to refresh on a concept you haven't used recently?

User: I work in web development so an example coding prompt I might ask is:
"I want to create a webpage for a [REDACTED] business with a navbar, hero section, contact us, footer, and services section.
Create an HTML file with all of these elements.
Use 'Some Company' as the placeholder company name and include basic styling with a blue and green theme.
Ensure the webpage is responsive.
The 'main' section should include 4 equal sized cards that hold an image and title and flip over to display text when clicked."

This gives me a good starting point and saves me from doing repetitive tasks.

When asking for a refresh on a concept I might ask something like:
"I am creating a website that would allow users to make posts, what are best practices if I want to avoid allowing one user to spam my website with thousands of posts in a short time."

AI: That's a great example of how you use AI as a starting point for common web development patterns. It sounds like you're being quite specific in your requests to get exactly what you need.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Any tasks that involve secret information like API keys I do not delegate.
Any tasks that require a high attention to detail like specific styling or implementing complex algorithms I prefer to do myself. These solutions can often be length and complex with a variety of possible approaches and I find that it is simpler and less time consuming to implement them myself than review AI code output.

AI: That makes sense - you're being strategic about when the back-and-forth with AI becomes more work than just doing it yourself.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will often start with AI produced code and work on it until I run into a difficult problem.
I will use a combination of web searching and AI prompts to work through difficult problems.
I find AI especially helpful when I run out of ideas for addressing an issue with my code.

AI: That's an interesting iterative approach - starting with AI, then switching between different resources when you hit roadblocks. It sounds like AI serves as one tool in your problem-solving toolkit rather than the only one.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I was initially an AI naysayer but many of my colleagues were early adopters, seeing their productivity improve massively and hearing anecdotes about how much they enjoyed working with AI motivated me to incorporate it more into my work.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like peer influence really shifted your perspective. You went from being skeptical to seeing the benefits firsthand through your colleagues' experiences.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was once attempting to implement a path finding algorithm using ChatGPT, I found that it really struggled with drawing nodes and edges in their correct positions and could not make accurate distance calculations. This was a few years ago however, and have found most models are much better at this now.

AI: That's a concrete example of how AI limitations can create real friction, especially with complex algorithmic tasks that require precision. And it's interesting that you've noticed improvements over time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No, any skill that AI currently excel at I delegate completely.
I find it hard to gage where AI improvements will happen, for example I did not expect the massive improvements in art and music generation.

AI: That's a pragmatic approach - embracing what AI does well rather than trying to compete with it. Your point about the unpredictability of AI progress is particularly insightful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect more and more of the tedious programming to be done by AI allowing me to focus on design and creative solutions without worrying about the technical difficulty of implementing my solutions.

AI: That's a compelling vision - AI handling the routine implementation while you focus on the higher-level creative and design challenges.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how peer influence shifted your view from skepticism to adoption, and your practical approach of delegating what AI does well rather than trying to maintain every skill.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI into your web development workflow - from initial skepticism to strategic adoption, and your thoughtful approach to when to collaborate versus delegate - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your actual usage patterns and examples. Have a great rest of your day!
