Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I'm happy to get started

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I most commonly use AI to help me debug or alter MySQL queries - it really helps me create cleaner and more efficient queries quickly. I also use AI to help me rephrase the explanations that I send to non-technical teams or clients so that they are easier to understand.

AI: That's really helpful context. I'm curious about the MySQL work specifically - when you're working on those queries, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you share the problem you're trying to solve and work through it step by step together, or do you give it your existing query and ask it to improve it?

User: I usually start writing the query myself, so I will send this along with an explanation of what I'm trying to achieve. I find that it sometimes take a bit of back-and-forth to get the results I'm after, so in this way it feels collaborative.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth sounds really interesting. When you think about your work more broadly, are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Generally, the only tasks that I would choose to handle myself are those that would require too much background information to be given to AI for it to come up with a high-quality response. In these cases, it feels quicker to handle these tasks myself. There are some situations where using AI would help me complete the task much faster, but there is too much PII to redact so I just do it myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the efficiency trade-off with background context and the PII considerations are really practical factors. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: My workplace is very pro AI. They run workshops on different aspects of AI use, like prompt engineering. I feel this has allowed me to freely explore using AI to help me deliver the best work I can in a timely manner.

AI: That supportive environment sounds really valuable. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would say that I am satisfied more than I am frustrated - I am aware that the way I structure my prompts and interact with AI hugely impacts what I get out of it. I did have a moment of frustration recently, when I was using AI to debug a MySQL query and it started joining tables and adding filters that I did not ask for. These tables and filters were from a previous conversation. I felt that I had to scrap the conversation and start again because it was becoming a bit of a mess.

AI: That's a really specific example - it sounds like the AI was carrying over context from earlier in the conversation in ways that weren't helpful for what you were trying to accomplish in that moment. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have definitely thought about it, but like with any technological advancement, I feel I just need to adapt the way I work so that I am using AI to my advantage, instead of trying to fight it. I know that AI can take over a lot of what I offer, but I feel it's really valuable to have someone knowledgeable to facilitate what it's doing. That's where I can add value.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on positioning yourself as someone who can guide and facilitate AI's work. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it as helping me achieve more than I could ever achieve on my own. I learn a lot from it, despite it often doing the heavy lifting.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on positioning yourself as a facilitator who adds value through knowledge and guidance, rather than seeing AI as something to compete against.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Honestly, I think that pretty much covers it. Thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the practical considerations around context and privacy, and your thoughtful approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
