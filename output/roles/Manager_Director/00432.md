Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude, and I'm here on behalf of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: that sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: i work in management for camp counselling, so I find it easy to use AI to help me plan weekly schedules and send out better emails to the counsellors I manage. I also use it to create certain tasks for the camp members to take part in

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you with several different aspects of your management role. 

When you say you use it to plan weekly schedules, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically work with AI to get those schedules created?

User: I have a rough draft that contains all the required subjects to cover over the camp, as well as some information on the students. I give all of the information, subjects, and student count to the AI and ask it to create a daily schedule for the current week

AI: That's helpful - so you're providing the framework and constraints, and the AI is doing the actual scheduling work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer handling the problem solving and also the very hyper-specific problems myself. If a parent has a complaint, or a student is hurt or affected by something, I handle that old fashion.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping the human-centered, sensitive situations in your own hands.

When you do use AI for those tasks like scheduling or creating activities, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it handle the task independently?

User: I go back and forth. I like to send an initial prompt, wait to see what I get back and then work with the AI to create something better. Tweaking things as we go.

AI: So it sounds like you see it as more of a collaborative process rather than just handing off a complete task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other people at the camp use AI tools, or is this something you've adopted on your own?

User: Most people at my camp are against AI. They think it will lose them their job. I've adopted this on my own and it saves me so much time

AI: That's an interesting position to be in - being the one who's found value in it while others are more hesitant.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was stressed and busy with personal problems, with no plan for the week. My counsellors were contacting me as they needed the plan, and I had nothing and was not in the mental state to produce the Monday plan. I entrusted AI completely with the task, and it created a Monday plan that fit my criteria perfectly, leaving me extremely satisfied

AI: That sounds like a moment when AI really came through for you when you needed it most.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I see AI as a tool more than competition. I dont think AI will immediately take over, but the people who utilize AI will take over.

AI: That's a really insightful way to look at it - focusing on how people who embrace these tools might have advantages.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different types of tasks as time goes on?

User: I imagine I will use it for more and more as time goes on. Especially with newer features coming out, agent features, etc, there will always be more uses for AI. The more I can replace of my own effort and time with AI, the more I can personally do. Everything becomes more efficient.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on seeing AI as a tool rather than competition, and how you've found it invaluable during stressful moments when you needed support.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I dont think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI collaboratively, navigating workplace skepticism, and how it's helped you during challenging moments will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
