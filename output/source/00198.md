Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope. Let's do this.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: There are a couple of things that I regularly use AI for. The most frequent task is asking a model to write a product ad or description for my Shopify store. I enter so many products, that I have run out of creative ideas. I always get a LLM to give me a couple of drafts of product descriptions to engage my shoppers. I also often ask for help in setting ROAS targets in my online advertising campaigns, mostly Google Ads. I will input past performance data, as well as performance data from last year during the same time period to get insights from the AI. This helps me set my ROAS targets and daily budgeting.  I also often ask for clarification about certain settings in Shopify and Google Ads.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into different aspects of managing your online business.

When you're working on those product descriptions, do you typically use the AI-generated drafts as-is, or do you find yourself editing and refining them? I'm curious about your process there.

User: I will usually use the draft as is, but I regularly fix the formatting, as it gets wonky when copying and pasting into my product description in Shopify. For example, sometimes the text will look normal in the LLM response, but when I paste it into the product description field in Shopify, it will be in a table format or have other markdown that looks bad. I will usually have to then paste it without formatting.

AI: That formatting issue sounds like a familiar pain point. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Setting product prices is something AI could help me with, but I always decide that myself. Being that product prices have to do with profit margins and competitor pricing, I research that information myself before setting a product price. AI could probably do a good job giving me an idea for a competitive price, but I have instinctively always done this without AI assistance. This probably stems form the nature of product pricing being so important to the bottom line, that I only trust my own judgement. Editing photos is another task that I generally perform myself, although AI could help me with that. Cropping and resizing, as well as group photos into one for product bundles are some tasks that come to mind. This is because the AI that can help with photo editing generally has a price associated with it that I cannot afford at the moment. I similarly work with promotional video ads. I generally take my own photos and short videos and clip them together using video editing software as opposed to asking AI to generate a video for me. The cost of AI assistance is the reason for this as well.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - both the trust factor around pricing decisions and the cost considerations for visual content creation.

When you do use AI for tasks like writing product descriptions or analyzing your ad performance data, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it handle the task independently?

User: I generally revisit my daily budget and ROAS target every two weeks. I give all of the information up front and then look at the analysis and suggestions of the AI. For example, I will tell the AI what type of campaign I am running and that last year's ROAS target was set at 500% for the next two weeks, and my store achieved 675% over those same two weeks last year. I will also give a summary of the ROAS performance over the last couple of weeks this year. Then I will ask what ROAS target I should set this year for the next two weeks? I will do something similar for the budget sometimes. I will tell the AI last year's budget and what my budget is currently set at and then get advice on how much I should spend this year over the next two weeks. For writing my product descriptions, I will sometimes give the AI the product description given to me from the manufacturer or distributor and ask it to rewrite it to make it unique, and I often ask for improvements, like making it more engaging, or not as wordy, etc. Sometimes, I will just describe the product and ask for a description or provide the barcode and ask for a description based on what the AI can find out about the product online. I will sometimes ask the AI to find a barcode, too, if I am putting in a preorder product and the manufacturer or distributor has not provided the barcode.

AI: It sounds like you've developed some pretty efficient workflows, especially with how you structure that advertising analysis every two weeks.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're running a Shopify store, I'm curious if you work with others or if there are communities or networks that have shaped your approach to using AI.

User: I have one other person that I work with. It is my business partner who owns half the business. I initially started using the built-in AI writing feature in Shopify when it was first rolled out and I trained my partner how to use it in a similar way that I do. I soon found that individual AI services did a better, more creative job at writing these descriptions, and we have fully opted to doing it that way on a paid monthly subscription. So, to answer your question, it was Shopify itself that influenced my use of AI. Previous to that, I only used free versions of AI services to proof-read and rewrite customer emails. We still use them to help with emails, which I forgot tom mention.

AI: That's interesting how Shopify's built-in feature was your gateway but then you discovered better options outside their platform.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time I worked with AI to analyze my advertising campaign settings (that I provided) was particularly impressive. I was happy that the AI knew more than I did about how the Google Ad campaigns worked and how to approach the ROAS target and budgeting. I was also impressed at its knowledge of using keywords and negative keywords with search campaigns and how best to use broad match keywords and exact match keywords. At the time, when I first used AI for this, business was disappointingly slow, and I wanted to boost our ads performance to reach more customers. I was desperate in a way. I have been frustrated when trying to get help with product information or a description and the AI provides information for a different product. Although frustrating, it wasn't out of the realm of possibility because these were brand new products being put in as preorders that the AI could not find much information about.

AI: That first experience with the Google Ads analysis sounds like it was a real game-changer when you needed it most. And I can definitely understand the frustration with those newer products where the AI just doesn't have the information yet.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider this, specifically working with HTML and CSS. I sometimes work in the back-end code to make design changes on our website. I would like to continue maintaining those skills in order to provide minor design and functionality changes even though AI is taking over this type of coding and coding in general. This is so I can understand the code myself for quick fixes when needed instead of having to take the time to interact with an AI for a solution to an urgent need.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - keeping those technical skills sharp for when you need quick fixes without going through the AI interaction process.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see me having the ability to upload photos to an AI and having it group them together for a bundle product. Also, I could see uploading photos and having the AI lighten them or edit them in other ways, like removing the background, etc. The same goes for creating videos. I can see myself using AI for creating engaging videos to attract customers in the future as long as my budget allows. Or, using the AI to provide design assistance for HTML/CSS needs. Like if I want to redesign a part of our website, I could upload the code for a specific page to the AI, explain what I want to change, and have it provide the code with the changes. I also see myself working closer with AI to better manage my Google Advertising as well as branching out into other advertising services, like Microsoft advertising and leasing ad space on specific websites. As I work toward opening a brick-and-mortar shop in the future, I can see using AI to assist with selecting a good location or general advice about leasing, insurance, security, computer networks, and communications.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance trusting AI for certain tasks like ad analysis while maintaining control over critical decisions like pricing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
