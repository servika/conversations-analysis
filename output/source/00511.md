Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I have no questions before we begin

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a kennel technician at an animal shelter, so the work is very hands-on. I do occasionally use AI for ideas and sanity checks. For example, I recently used it to ask for ideas on how to stuff Kong toys so that they last longer for our resident dogs. I've also used it to streamline kennel rotations during deep cleanings so that dogs with behavior issues towards other dogs aren't exposed to other dogs in the outdoor runs. I have used it to confirm my chain-of-thought before altering a routine (like dealing with animals in isolation in need of immediate care) as well.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a thinking partner for some pretty specialized situations. When you mention using it for "sanity checks" and confirming your chain-of-thought, can you tell me more about what that process looks like for you? How do you decide when a situation calls for that kind of consultation?

User: For sanity checks, I use it to confirm my assessment of a situation if I'm second-guessing myself. For confirming chain-of-thought, I will lay out all of the things currently demanding my attention, how I think I should organize them, and ask for insight on a better way to get everything done when everything is a priority. I typically decide that a situation calls for an AI consultation when I'm overwhelmed and/or second-guessing myself

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it when you're feeling overwhelmed or uncertain. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Most of my tasks I prefer to handle myself, because I am in-tune with the animals, their needs, and the standard routines. To try to describe every detail necessary for AI to have a complete grasp on the environment or situation and give me meaningful output seems impossible. So while AI could be helpful, I don't consider using it because it seems like more work to do so.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the complexity of communicating all those environmental details. It sounds like there's a lot of nuanced, situational knowledge that comes from being physically present with the animals. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am way more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task. I can't recall a time where I delegated a complete task for it to handle independently.

AI: That collaborative approach makes sense given what you've described about your work environment. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it something you've explored more on your own?

User: My workplace culture does seem to influence the way I use AI, unfortunately. Given the age demographics of my coworker, AI is generally misunderstood and/or frowned upon. So I do not openly talk about it unless I'm among coworkers who are open to recognizing the value in collaborating with AI

AI: That's an important dynamic - having to be selective about when and how you discuss it. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was satisfied when I asked AI to generate volunteer task schedules based on each volunteers' chosen time slot and how that fit into the shelter's routine. It helped me avoid having to double-back and check on what the volunteers had taken care of or missed, and especially helped the volunteers to be more autonomous and avoid doubling-up on tasks that don't call for two people

AI: That sounds like it created a really smooth workflow for everyone involved. On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI at work left you feeling frustrated?

User: Yes, I've rarely received useful output when I've asked AI how to deal with behavioral issues that typically involve keeping certain animals separate within a facility that has very limited capabilities for doing so. Again, inputting all the details necessary for the AI to consider in order to produce a truly useful solution is a barrier in those situations

AI: That really highlights the challenge you mentioned earlier about the complexity of your environment. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's not something I actively consider at an animal shelter because the human touch cannot be replicated when directly dealing with the animals

AI: That's a powerful point about the irreplaceable human element in animal care. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: If I ever stray into the administrative side of shelter work (not something I'm eager to do to be honest), I'd love to see AI used to improve the permanent adoption rates for shelter animals. The adoption staff do the best that they can to screen potential adopters, but unfortunately humans lie and/or simply don't listen all to often, leading to adoptions turning into returns for reasons that could have been avoided with better education and adopter vetting.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on where AI could make a meaningful difference in animal welfare outcomes. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful thoughts about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the irreplaceable human touch with animals shapes where AI fits - and doesn't fit - into your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing that I can think of at the moment, thanks for asking

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative thinking partner while recognizing the irreplaceable human elements of animal care will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.

User: Likewise!

AI: Thank you so much! Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with all the important work you're doing at the shelter.
