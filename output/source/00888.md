Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I have no questions

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my typical workday, the only AI that is used is the AI answers provided when conducting a Google search. I would use the AI to determine an answer to a question more easily or for help figuring out specifics of the Landlord Tenant Act in Ontario.

AI: That's interesting - so you're primarily using AI through Google's search results for quick answers and legal research. 

Tell me more about how you use it for the Landlord Tenant Act specifically. What kinds of situations come up where you turn to AI for those details?

User: I work as a Housing Stability Worker, helping individuals recovering from chronic homelessness. Therefore, I use it to determine the meaning of different "N" notices or to determine if a client's rights as a tenant are being infringed upon. For example, I have used AI to determine if a landlord entered a client's unit legally. As an additional example, I have also used it to summarize the different "N" notices in a way that is easy to explain to a client.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work. So you're using AI as a way to quickly interpret legal information and then translate it for your clients.

When you're dealing with these tenant rights situations, are there aspects of the work that you prefer to handle yourself rather than turning to AI, even when it might be able to help?

User: I do prefer to double check the information being given by the AI as it sometimes does not use reliable sources, so I suppose I do end up handling most situations by myself

AI: That makes a lot of sense given the legal nature of your work and how important accuracy is for your clients.

When you do use AI for these searches, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine your understanding, or do you tend to ask it one question and then move on to verify the information elsewhere?

User: Ask one question and then move on elsewhere.

AI: Got it - so it's more of a starting point for you rather than an ongoing conversation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team approach it similarly, or have you noticed different patterns?

User: I find some of my collogues are more trusting of the AI answer. I can see that there are other ways that AI could be useful (writing notes, brainstorming problem solving ideas), but in terms of my workplace, it runs the risk of creating a privacy breach (my workplace operates under PHIPPA).

AI: That's a really important distinction - the privacy considerations definitely create constraints around how you can use AI tools in your work environment.

Can you share a time when using AI for your tenant rights research made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes the AI will provide an answer, but will be citing an unreliable source (e.g. a random article) or it sometimes does not provide correct information for my province

AI: That sounds frustrating, especially when you're trying to help clients with time-sensitive housing issues and need reliable provincial information.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, particularly around legal research or other aspects of your work?

User: I think the nature of my work as a whole, which also includes other aspects of housing stability (wellness, food security, community inclusion, etc.), is not susceptible to being taken over by AI. At it's core, it is person-centred, human-to-human work. While AI can sometimes assist in getting me quicker answers about housing policy or community resources, it cannot do the other aspects of my job.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on how AI complements rather than replaces the human-centered aspects of your role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself potentially using it differently as the technology develops, or do you think you'll maintain this cautious, verification-focused approach?

User: I think I will continue to maintain a cautious, verification-focused approach. At the end of the day, it is much more important that the information I have is accurate than it is for me to save time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the human-centered nature of your work creates natural boundaries around AI use, and your commitment to accuracy over efficiency when it comes to your clients' housing rights.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think perhaps that my experience with AI is limited because of issues with privacy. While I would benefit with a more streamlined way to write case notes, it is incredibly sensitive information. Perhaps if the AI was integrated into the secure platform that we use for case notes, it could have the necessary safeguards in place to protect that information.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea that integration with existing secure platforms could unlock more AI utility while maintaining the privacy protections you need. That tension between potential benefits and privacy requirements seems to be a key factor shaping how you can engage with these tools.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working in a privacy-sensitive environment and the importance of accuracy in tenant rights work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
