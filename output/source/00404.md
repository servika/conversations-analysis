Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions.  Let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently my use of AI at work is limited to my own use of AI to research various topics for work, mostly to better help me learn and understand new things.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a learning tool. Can you tell me more about what kinds of topics you typically research with AI and how that learning process works for you?

User: I work as a shift supervisor in retail/food service at a gas station so my role covers lots of different topics.  I often encounter situations where I need to get a quick grasp on a topic and I like how AI collates many sources into quickly digestible output.  This can include things such as understanding business accounting practices, foodservice standards and practices, or troubleshooting various equipement.

AI: That sounds really practical - getting quick, digestible information across such a wide range of areas. When you're using AI to learn about these different topics, how do you typically interact with it? Do you ask follow-up questions to dig deeper, or do you usually get what you need from that first response?

User: I typically use it when I run into something I don't understand that I think AI will help me with.  Yes occasionally I have to fine tune my prompt in order to get to exactly what I'm looking for.

AI: I see - so it's more of a just-in-time approach when specific questions come up. When you say you sometimes need to fine-tune your prompt, what does that process look like? How do you adjust your questions to get closer to what you're looking for?

User: In the same way I would imagine most people use AI, sometimes AI tries to give you a broad response to cover the entire topic.  So fine tuning usually involves providing more details in order to get a response more specific to the given situation.

AI: That makes sense - narrowing it down to get more targeted help for your specific situation. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Not specifically.  At my job there is not currently any official implementation of AI so most tasks are by default done without AI.  I usually bring in AI to help me personally with understanding work things.

AI: I understand - so you're bringing AI in on your own initiative for learning, while the actual work tasks are handled traditionally. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask it a question and then take that information back to handle the work yourself?

User: Typically when I run into something I need help understanding I will pull out my phone and use AI to see if it can help me better understand the situation.  I tend to use AI to do the research and then take that information back to the task myself.  It's not collaborative.

AI: That's a clear distinction - using AI for the research phase and then applying that knowledge yourself. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they know you're using it this way, or is it something you do more privately?

User: I'm sure management is aware that employees use AI for work.  I don't think it's discouraged but I do think that you need to be careful with the information you get from AI.  That is make sure it makes sense and double check it if you have doubts, the same precautions you would take with any information you're getting off the internet.  But it certainly is helpful and in a fast paced environment it certainly has its value if it's helping you save time.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - recognizing both the value and the need for caution. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Part of my job is interacting with customers and the often have questions I don't immediately know the answer to.  I enjoy being able to provide customers with answers to their questions regarding our service.  Because it's a fast paced environment I don't always have the time to research questions as well as I would like but AI has helped me with that.  Working at a gas station customers often have questions about our different gas grades or oil viscosities and which one their car can use.  AI helps me get answers to customer questions quickly and helps me find a way to express it in a way they will understand.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying use case - being able to help customers in the moment rather than having to say you don't know. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not to worried about it for now.  I feel like for a work environment like mine AI will always need to have a human back up.  So while I see AI potentially helping with the workload in the future I don't feel like it would take many of my skills completely out of practice.

AI: That's an interesting point about always needing human backup in your environment. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue using it mainly for research, or do you see it expanding into other areas?

User: I'm sure I will continue to use it for research in my personal and professional life.  I do hope that it is further implemented in my work place.  There are lots of tedious tasks/checks that take place throughout the day that I feel could someday be passed to AI/automation using cameras and smart sensors.  But that is probably still in the future for my workplace.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a research tool to better serve customers in real-time, and how you balance the benefits with appropriate caution about verifying information.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a just-in-time learning tool in a fast-paced retail environment, and how it helps you better serve customers, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
