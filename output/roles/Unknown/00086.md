Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great! Feel free to proceed.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I work in a 2D materials lab at a university. A recent project I endeavored in was the creation of hBN-encapsulated TMDs for observation via STEM imaging for atomic-resolution imaging in order to see the atomic structure and possible larger moire patterns formed by including samples with bi or quadlayer twisted TMDs. The initial idea was formed by my mentor, and I then took it and fabricated the relevant samples - the samples were then passed along to another group who runs the STEM, and the analysis was done altogether.

AI: That's fascinating - working with twisted TMDs and those moire patterns sounds like really cutting-edge research. It sounds like you had several distinct phases there: taking your mentor's initial concept, doing the sample fabrication yourself, collaborating with the STEM group, and then the collective analysis.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I have used AI tools minimally to better understand the reasoning behind different steps (i.e., trying to understand the reason behind stamp architecture, attempting to better understand how an STEM works at a deeper level, attempting to understand the implications of the formation of a moire pattern) and have used it somewhat for some data analysis, as we had seen some unusual features and wanted further input.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've used AI in a couple of different ways. Let me focus on one of those areas first.

For the data analysis where you saw unusual features and wanted further input, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for analyzing those features.

User: Well since we were simply viewing images and scanning over different regions of interest using an STEM, there wasn't really a way to easily get numerical values for basic interpretation. Thus, reverting to an AI to describe the features (without using an image for privacy sake) and ask for any ideas seemed beneficial, and it did in fact provide some valuable insight. We also, of course, analyzed it normally by gaining what we could (i.e., moire wavelength, twist angle...) but most of it was more subjective analysis.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI when you're dealing with more subjective, qualitative analysis of image features rather than straightforward numerical measurements. It sounds like AI was particularly helpful when you needed that additional perspective on interpreting what you were seeing.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the sample fabrication, the conceptual understanding work, or other aspects - what's kept you from trying AI tools there, if anything?

User: Well I did use it for the conceptual understanding of some aspects, as mentioned. It can be difficult to incorporate it into the sample fabrication when that requires more of pure practice to get it mastered - from experience, simply understanding it isn't enough.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - that some parts of research require that hands-on mastery that comes from repeated practice, not just conceptual understanding. 

When you've used AI for conceptual understanding - like learning about stamp architecture or how STEM works - how do you verify or validate what it produces? How do you know the explanations it's giving you are accurate?

User: If it aligns with everything I've heard from my mentors and from general scientific literature I've read, I tend to trust it. I only dive in further into analyzing its answers if it would actually impact how I create stamps or interact with my sample in any way other than my conceptual understanding.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using your existing knowledge from mentors and literature as a filter. It makes sense that you'd scrutinize it more carefully when it could actually affect your hands-on work.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Finding relevant and useful scientific literature, as that is an area it feels like AI certainly lacks in. It seems to be able to summarize general ideas in research, but when asking for citations or for it to narrow down on a specific paper, it seems to lack in major ways. I tried to use AIs for this before, but have since gave up.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the gap between AI being able to discuss general scientific concepts versus actually helping you navigate and find the specific literature you need. It sounds like you've actually tried this before and it didn't meet your needs.

Tell me more about that experience when you tried using AI for literature search - what exactly happened that made you give up on it?

User: I would be provided papers and the actual claims in the paper when I looked into it wouldn't really align with what the AI was claiming it was telling. There would often be a couple of similar keywords, and it would be roughly aligned in scope, but the AI wouldn't be able to capture the essence of the paper.

AI: That's really frustrating - getting papers that sound relevant on the surface but miss the actual essence of what you need. It sounds like the AI was essentially doing keyword matching rather than truly understanding the research context and nuance.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into different stages of research work, particularly that distinction between conceptual understanding versus hands-on practice, were really insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, thank you for the interview.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about how AI can be valuable for conceptual understanding and subjective analysis, but falls short in literature search and hands-on fabrication work, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific research. 

That point about AI missing the essence of papers despite getting keywords right was particularly illuminating - it shows how much domain expertise and contextual understanding matters in research.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
