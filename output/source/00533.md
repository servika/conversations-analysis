Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions, so please begin.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: There are three main things I use AI for at work. First, I often use it as a source of reference imagery for jewellery designs I am creating. For example, if I need an image of an eagle in flight, viewed from an isometric angle, I will generate it using AI rather than searching for an image. Secondly, I sometimes use AI to draft copy for product listings. Thirdly, I sometimes use AI to help me generate app scripts for processing multiple spreadsheets, usually for bookkeeping purposes.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of creative and technical applications. I'd like to understand more about your preferences when working with AI.

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Although I could probably have an AI generate mock-ups of finished jewellery, and base my designs on those, I prefer to only use AI for reference images, and create the final designs myself. I worry that relying too much on AI would dull my creativity, and I think my customers would probably prefer that there is still a strong human influence behind the creations they purchase.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction you make between reference material and the actual creative work. 

When you do use AI for those three tasks you mentioned - the reference imagery, product copy, and app scripts - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: With reference imagery, I will typically have a rough sketch of the final piece. I will then ask an AI to generate an image reference for an element of the final piece. For example I may need an image of a rabbit skeleton in a certain pose. I will then check that image against online sources to make sure there aren't any obvious errors. If I am happy with the image, I then import it to Adobe Illustrator and manually trace it as a starting point for the design. For product copy, I usual upload an image of the piece, some product details, and some information about the target demographic. Typically I will ask for product details as bullet points and leave the rest up to the AI. With app scripts, I usually just describe my goal, and then test the AI-produced script on a sample spreadsheet. Then I will request refinements if needed, or make them manually if they're within my ability.

AI: That's really helpful - I can see you have quite different approaches for each use case. It sounds like with the imagery you're very hands-on throughout, while with scripts you're more willing to let AI take the lead initially.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Because I am the owner-operator of my business, I have pretty free reign over how I choose to use AI. I have a business partner who sometimes checks in on what I am doing with AI, but they don't influence my usage.

AI: That makes sense - having that autonomy as a business owner definitely gives you more flexibility to experiment and find what works for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. Recently I wanted an image that I was going to use for social media. I don't often use AI for this purpose, but it was the easiest way to achieve what I wanted. Or so I thought. I wanted an image of a man in front of an industrial background in the style of a communist propaganda poster. I used an AI to generate the image with a fairly simple prompt, not much detail at all. The image they created was great, but I decided I wanted the background to use an image of a specific city instead of what it had created. I found a photo of the city in question, and asked the AI to switch the background over, but to use the same style as the original design. It swapped out the background like I asked, but the style didn't match at all. It just looked like a photo with some colours painted over the top. I asked the AI to make the styles consistent but it just gave me same image again. No matter what I tried it just gave me the same image, with maybe a tiny little change. In frustration, I tried passing the image to a different AI and asking it to make the style consistent without altering the man at all. That AI made the style consistent, but completely changed the style of the man. No matter how I formed the prompt, neither AI could get it right. I gave up in the end. Very frustrating!

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating! It really highlights how challenging it can be when you have a specific creative vision but the AI keeps missing the mark, especially when you're trying to get that precise balance between different elements.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's something I've considered. I enjoy using my creative skills, so I wouldn't delegate them to AI even if I was sure that it would do a good job. However, I have no doubt that there are already competitors out there using AI to come up with ideas quickly and effectively, and I worry about falling behind. I'm also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous companies using AI to quickly copy my designs, since there are already AI's capable of generating vectors and 3D meshes.

AI: That tension you describe - between wanting to preserve your own creative process while staying competitive - sounds really complex to navigate. The concern about design copying adds another layer to that challenge.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I certainly see myself using AI more often as an administrative aide, especially as it becomes more integrated with the platforms I use. For example, I expect in the future I will be able to hop on to my ecommerce platform and say something along the lines of "find all lines which have monthly sales of less than 10% of peaks sales and add them to the clearance section at 40% off, then generate a newsletter summarising the new additions to the clearance section and send to all subscribers". That's something I currently have to do manually and find no enjoyment in.

AI: That's a compelling vision of AI handling those tedious administrative tasks while you focus on the creative work you enjoy. It sounds like you see a clear path toward AI taking on more operational support rather than replacing your core creative skills.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that boundary between reference material and your actual creative process, and how you're thinking strategically about where AI can add value versus where you want to preserve your human touch.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just that I mainly want to use AI to save time on tedious and unrewarding aspects of my work, freeing up my time for more rewarding endeavours, work-based or otherwise!

AI: That's a perfect summary and really gets to the heart of how you see AI's role - as a tool for liberation from the tedious stuff rather than replacement of the meaningful work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing creative integrity with competitive pressures, and your clear vision for AI as an administrative aide, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about these questions.

User: You're welcome. Bye!

AI: Bye! Thanks again for participating - this was really valuable.
