Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI is still a relatively new implementation in my day job at a billing call center. It is primarily used for two things right now: summarizing transcripts and answering questions (fact-finding/research). Occasionally it's also used for assisting with wording responses to customer complaints but this isn't used often. I understand the next expected use of AI at my job will be for providing assistance with guiding the worker to best course of action given the nature of the call.

AI: Tell me more about how you use AI for summarizing transcripts - what does that process look like for you day-to-day?

User: It's an automatic process that occurs once the call ends. This has been very helpful as manual notes haven't always been taken, so it allows us to review past calls when addressing customer concerns. However, the outputs are not always accurate, so it is a tool but not a guarantee of what occurred.

AI: That's interesting that it happens automatically. When the AI summaries aren't accurate, how do you handle that? Do you find yourself double-checking them regularly, or do you notice the inaccuracies in other ways?

User: I have gone back and checked my own, which is how I'm aware they are not accurate. I've mentioned this to leadership and have advised others that although this is helpful, we still want to aim for additional evidence to back up what we expect happened on the call. In most cases, it does appear that the inaccuracies are minor, but sometimes it seems the model may be getting thrown off track by calls that include non sequitur tangents. 
This has lead me to personally still notate accounts manually when I suspect a difficult transcript in order to provide additional details for the next person researching the account.

AI: You mentioned that you still take manual notes when you suspect a difficult transcript. What makes you identify a call as potentially "difficult" for the AI to transcribe accurately?

User: One thing is pricing and quotes; the AI sometimes gives the wrong information about what pricing was discussed with which packages. I also notate if it is a more complex situation, such as something involving multiple accounts and needing multiple steps with several different departments.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I mentioned earlier the use of AI at my job for research and fact-finding. This is something I personally rarely use the AI for because of continual inaccuracies I've experienced with it. This is different because this work is done live on the call, and I pride myself on giving correct information to customers. The company has something like an encyclopedia of company services, policies, and procedures, and it is massive and can be hard to sift through. However, it is verifiable company information, and while the AI is supposed to be using it, I have caught conflicting answers from it multiple times. Rather than waste time asking the AI just to fact-check (or not and risk providing incorrect information), I would much rather just go to the source.

AI: When you do use AI for work - like with those automatic summaries - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: The automatic summaries are completely independent, I have no input on how those are produced. With the research AI, I try to delegate tasks initially (by asking a question) but will sometimes collaborate if I'm trying to get additional insight (such as clarifying a different scenario or added expectations).

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: The fact that the AI has been introduced has influenced me to try to use it more, as it's clearly becoming a bigger component of the workplace. However, I feel I'm personally more skeptical than many others of the AI's information unless I verify it.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The call summaries have been very satisfying; although I still have to take them with a grain of salt, they are incredibly helpful in trying to piece together why a customer may have been given wrong information. They've also been very helpful in my catching up on prior calls without the tedium of going through non-call notes on the account. My frustration has been more with the research AI; sometimes it misunderstands what I ask for, in some cases it doesn't even answer my question. I've had to learn how to reshape my questions to get it to answer my query, but even then there are the concerns I previously mentioned of the inaccurate or conflicting answers it gives.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider this often. This is why I don't defer every question I have to AI and part of why I still pride myself on my ability to find my own answers. I'm well-known at my job for being able to find answers and although the AI can help, it still has a long way to go before it can truly compete.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Like I said before, I know my job is planning to integrate AI in some other ways. I'm hopeful at least some of it will prove useful, but I also believe I'm just as likely to be the person finding and reporting issues.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining a healthy skepticism while still being open to AI's potential benefits, and how you've developed strategies to work around its current limitations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with verification processes, and your approach to maintaining your own expertise while adapting to new tools, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
