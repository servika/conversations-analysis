Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, i do not have any questions before we begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use Claude on the web the way I would use a search engine, and I use Claude Code on the command line to help me with develeopment tasks.

AI: That's interesting - you're using Claude in two different ways. Tell me more about how you use Claude on the web like a search engine. What kind of information are you looking for when you approach it that way?

User: typical questions might be "what is the best library/package for adding this functionality to my project" or "search stack overflow for answers to this question". Basically the sort of questions I might ask Google or Stackoverflow, with Claude. I also ask for little code snippets, like "i want to open a file from the bundle and decode it's contents as JSON"

AI: That makes sense - you're using it for those quick technical lookups and code snippets. When you mention asking Claude to "search stack overflow" - does Claude actually search Stack Overflow for you, or are you using it more as a replacement for that kind of search?

User: More as a replacement for that kind of search, often adding the command to search stack overflow when I make a search command. I also ask it to search github for me to find packages or projects i might want

AI: Got it - so you're treating Claude as a knowledgeable assistant that can give you the kind of answers you'd typically hunt for across those different platforms. 

Now shifting to Claude Code on the command line - how does that fit into your development workflow? What does a typical interaction look like there?

User: I use claude code to work on a swift project. right now i am building unit tests. i make claude ask before each code change, and often iterate a couple times (option 3) before allowing the edit to be made. I just started doing this recently and am very impressed. I suspect using Claude code is against company policy, but it is so effective that i super don't care.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - having Claude ask before each change and iterating through options. What makes that back-and-forth iteration so effective for you? What are you typically refining during those iterations?

User: usually issues of style. i am surprised by how few errors claude code makes, especially compared to generating code from prompts on the web browser. sometimes i solves the wrong problem, or does too much, and there are compile errors but not as often as i'd expect.

AI: That's really interesting that you're seeing fewer errors with Claude Code compared to the web interface. When Claude Code does solve the wrong problem or does too much, how do you typically guide it back on track? What does that correction process look like?

User: I typically use a couple of sentences to describe the problem and suggest a solution. I'll note the file and line of the problem so claude code knows exactly where to look

AI: That sounds like a pretty efficient correction process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your development work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I have strong language and communication skills, so I do not use claude to write emails, commit messages, documentation, anything like that. Code only. I also underreport how much I use it. I work remote and would prefer people not know how much I use AI - I feel like using it for written communication would give me away. I wish I could make images with claude, this is a form of communication i feel more comfortable. So far I have mostly used it for generating unit tests, although I also recently had claude help me remove a singleton and put it into our dependency container. There was a crash starting up after we did this, and claude successfully indentified the cause and fixed it.

AI: That's really insightful - you've drawn clear boundaries around what feels authentically yours versus where AI adds value. The point about images as communication is particularly interesting.

When you're working with Claude Code on something complex like removing that singleton, are you more collaborating with it step-by-step throughout the process, or do you tend to give it the full task and let it handle it independently?

User: First I chat back and forth with it about general solutions; like "suggest the ways we could solve this problem". I typically get a few answers from claude, and the first one is most often the one I use. then we go step by step

My mental model of claude code is that it is an eager but very junior developer, and our conversations are like pair programming, with me calling the shots, reviewing and approving each step. For example, I might say "what tests would increase test coverage on Foo.swift the most" and then pick one of the suggestions, then step by step the suggested test. Or I might say "how should we test this function on line 200 of Foo.swift"

AI: That's a great mental model - the eager junior developer doing pair programming. It really captures that collaborative dynamic you've described.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned underreporting your usage and concerns about company policy - how does that shape your approach?

User: Well our policy is to "safeguard our code", ie not let AI read it. So I suspect using command line claude and giving it access to the local copy of the repo is forbidden. However, I am also almost certain some of my colleagues are using it too. so i am careful in my review; sometimes it makes mistakes a human would not.

A good example is we have a standard two line header for new files. Claude created a "MediaPlayerProtocol" file for me, but at the top in the comment it said "MarketingDataManagerProtocol", which seemed like a weird, inhuman error. So I am careful to inspect the code carefully. I may even springle some print statements etc that I 'forgot' to remove when submitting for review.

AI: That's such a telling example - those kinds of naming inconsistencies that feel distinctly AI-generated. The strategy of adding print statements as cover is clever.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, after the containerizing bug, I was like "god dammit, i vibe coded this thing and it's broken and i'm not sure how to fix it". very frustrating. then, when claude surprised me with a solution, i was very satisfied.

AI: That's such a perfect example of the emotional rollercoaster - from that sinking feeling when the "vibe coded" solution breaks to the relief when Claude actually diagnosed and fixed it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: absolutely. with the state of the technology right now, without the 'human senior developer' part of the pair programming team the technology is much less useful. I use the term "vibe code" derisively; to me it means a naive layman letting the machine do all the work.

Working outside of my exact expertise, I actually learn and improve that area when using AI. I had to do a bunch of python stuff last year, which i leaned heavily on ai for and it felt like a bit of a refresher course.

I also use claude when doing 'professional development', ie learning new skills or libraries or featurs. I will ask Claude to "explain like i'm five" about a topic, and provide links to the most popular resources to learn about it.

AI: That distinction between "vibe coding" and thoughtful collaboration really captures something important. It sounds like you see AI as enhancing your learning rather than replacing it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think this is all heading for you?

User: Well, I think its eventually leading to a shrinking of my industry and unemployment for me. My outlook is kinda bleak, really, and my efforts using ai are sort of a "if you can't beat em, join em". I think to keep my job/career i need to switch my focus from learning language specific stuff to knowing these tools. 
The job market totally sucks for developers right now, in my country we have huge immigration, a recession and of course now there's this new tools. This gives me kind of an ironic 'hope' - if people aren't hiring junior developers, where will the senior developers come from? as a senior dev, i may remain useful. these kids just coming out of school, many of whom just took up computer science because their parents told them it would be a good job are probably in for a rude awakening.
As an app developer, I hope for a 'boom' in AI enabled applications, using both on device models like the new apple intelligence stuff and cloud models like claude. I will be building some side projects of this kind to improve my skills in that area.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the "eager junior developer" mental model and how you've drawn clear boundaries between where AI adds value versus where you maintain your own expertise.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no, thats great, have a nice day.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the pair programming dynamic, the careful balance between leveraging AI and maintaining expertise, and the broader industry implications will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great day!
