Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use AI to complete repetitive, long tasks or to help with email writing.

AI: Tell me more about those repetitive, long tasks. What specific kinds of work are you referring to?

User: I am referring to tasks such as editing a large set of HTML files to make the same changes in the same context. For example, if there is a directory with 20 HTML files, and all of them need to have header icons changed to improve accessibility, I will tell AI the paths to the accessible images and tell it to replace the old header images.

AI: That's a really specific example - I can see how that would save you significant time. When you're working on something like those HTML accessibility updates, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you give it all the file paths and instructions at once, or do you work through it step by step together?

User: I usually give it all the instructions at once, and then if something goes wrong, I work on the task together with the AI.

AI: What does it look like when something goes wrong? Can you walk me through what typically happens and how you and the AI work together to fix it?

User: When something goes wrong, how it looks varies by task, however, the most common issues are logic errors. For example, in the HTML image replacement task described above, the agent might use the wrong replacement image if there is more than one icon on the header bar. For example, if the header contains book.png and help.png, it might use newbook.png to replace the old help icon and newhelp.png to replace the old book icon.

AI: That's an interesting logic error pattern. When you encounter something like the AI mixing up which replacement image goes where, how do you typically approach correcting that? Do you give it new instructions or take a different approach?

User: Often, the issues are caused by not clarifying obvious details so I fix them by providing the AI with extra instructions that may be obvious to a human being.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle tasks where completing the task would help me learn something and the task is related to something I am interested in or have a passion for.

AI: Can you give me a specific example of a task like that - something you chose to do yourself because you wanted to learn from it, even though AI could have helped?

User: I debugged a BeautifulSoup script to convert MS Word documents to HTML code manually.

AI: What made debugging that BeautifulSoup script something you wanted to tackle yourself rather than getting AI assistance with?

User: I wanted to learn BeautifulSoup and I felt that reading the code and consulting documentation to see what was wrong would help with learning.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues have influenced me to use AI more often. For example, I wouldn't use AI to replace repetitive images as mentioned earlier until I saw my colleague do it.

AI: What was it about seeing your colleague use AI for that image replacement task that convinced you to try it yourself? Was it just seeing that it was possible, or was there something else about their approach that influenced you?

User: Seeing that it was possible, and that it saved him a few hours of manual work inspired me to use AI as a tool while working.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time, I was learning how to write JavaScript code to make interactive features such as a pen feature, and my code wasn't working due to bugs. I used AI to debug it and on the first try, the code that it returned worked exactly as I imagined, fixing the bugs. This made me feel satisfied because it saved me a lot of time and produced the exact result I wanted without much effort.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience! I noticed earlier you mentioned preferring to debug the BeautifulSoup script yourself because you wanted to learn, but in this JavaScript situation you used AI for debugging. What made the difference for you between those two situations?

User: I wasn't really interested in learning about interactive JavaScript in the manner that I was using it, and I also didn't have much time, as my manager gave me the JavaScript task without warning or prior discussion. On the other hand, I was interested in learning BeautifulSoup, and maintaining the script was one of my core responsibilities.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think I understood the question, could you please clarify what you mean by maintaining my skills?

AI: Sure - I'm asking about whether you think about keeping your own abilities sharp in areas where AI is becoming more capable. For instance, since AI can help with coding tasks, do you ever worry about your own coding skills getting rusty, or do you make deliberate choices to practice certain skills yourself to stay proficient?

User: I make deliberate choices to maintain my software development skills through practice, even if I write less code and use AI as an assistant to speed up my work.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to continue to use AI to automate monotonous tasks and I hope that AI becomes more adaptable to large codebases and templates, and precise in writing code, so I can use it for a larger variety of tasks, such as code generation in a situation where adherence to templates and other small details are essential.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you decide when to learn something yourself versus when to delegate to AI - that balance between maintaining your skills in areas you're passionate about while still leveraging AI for efficiency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I have no more questions in relation to the interview. Am I free to close this window now or are there other steps I must first take to complete the task?

AI: You're all set! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

There are no other steps needed - you're free to close the window whenever you're ready. Thanks again!
