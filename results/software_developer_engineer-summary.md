## Representative Insights

### How Software Developers & Engineers Use AI

1. "I am a game developer/designer. I have been using AI to create things ranging from concept art, 2D graphics that can be used in game such as UI elements, sprites, textures, etc. I also you AI for image to 3D or text to 3D to rapidly create 3D assets that can be used in game. I have also been experimenting with audio AIs to generate music, sound effects, and voices for dialog."
   *— From conversation 00014.md*

2. "There are 2 main concerns that I have. The first is that talented people will lose their jobs once AI can create production ready assets with a few prompts. The other is backlash from users if they know that AI was used to create some of the assets."
   *— From conversation 00014.md*

3. "At first, I put a considerable amount of time and effort into scouring through Google's official documentation for modern Android development, however, as I continued in the earliest stages of product planning and development, I learned that my time was better served utilizing AI to help answer questions about my project."
   *— From conversation 00016.md*

4. "I think its important to note that I have years of experience with coding, but not much experience with Android. By that, I mean, compared to someone who might be considered very skilled. Thus, I began to realize early on that AI was very capable of assisting with ensuring that I understood the basic concepts, kept my data layer and UI layer separate, helped to ensure that my files would work together, and most importantly, assisting with debugging and errors."
   *— From conversation 00016.md*

5. "Ultimately, I make the decisions, but I've utilized AI quite a bit in providing suggestions. When a suggestion doesn't work out the way it was expected, I just try a different approach. I also use a few different AI models to get comparisons."
   *— From conversation 00016.md*

6. "Honestly, in the past, I may have eventually given up on projects because I'd hit a wall and sometimes life has other priorities. With the help of AI however, I've gotten much farther in the process than in the past and I can actually see myself completing this project."
   *— From conversation 00016.md*

7. "I do have concerns. It's an extremely tough job market, and AI is only a part of the reason for the difficulty graduates face. If you want me to be completely honest, I'm not a huge fan of using AI in lieu of actual customer service, simply because it allows a company an 'out' for not solving issues for its paying customers."
   *— From conversation 00016.md*

8. "For this particular project, I used AI to assist with creating the code for extracting the combined data to an Excel spreadsheet."
   *— From conversation 00038.md*

9. "I chose to output the data to excel, because I wanted a cleaner and more organized way to present the results. Choosing AI to help with this seemed like a great idea after I realized how labor intensive it was to read through the guides to figure out what commands to use."
   *— From conversation 00038.md*

10. "I'm used to using traditional methods to solve these types of problems (e.g. reading books, searching the internet, watching videos). I had a lack of understanding and low level of trust for AI during the time. Additionally, the workplace had rules on the use of AI that I did not fully understand, which caused some additional hesitation. There has been a shift since, that allows more freedom to use such tools."

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "There are 2 main concerns that I have. The first is that talented people will lose their jobs once AI can create production ready assets with a few prompts. The other is backlash from users if they know that AI was used to create some of the assets."
   *— From conversation 00014.md*

2. "I do have concerns. It's an extremely tough job market, and AI is only a part of the reason for the difficulty graduates face. If you want me to be completely honest, I'm not a huge fan of using AI in lieu of actual customer service, simply because it allows a company an 'out' for not solving issues for its paying customers."
   *— From conversation 00016.md*

3. "Even though I have my concerns, I am a nerd at heart. I love tech and will continue to utilize it. I'm looking forward to a time when an AI model can output graphic representations for the UI layers in our work product."
   *— From conversation 00016.md*

4. "I am quite sceptical of using AI for research/ writing as for research, I worry it will miss out something crucial, so i prefer to do it myself. In terms of writing, although i know it can be helpful for formatting or sometimes editing, I like my style of writing and if I use AI I know it's not me. I also think most available AI has a very obvious writing style which I would then have to edit to make it soound like me, which would end up taking more time"
   *— From conversation 00052.md*

5. "Two issues that I have concerns about are hidden biases and reproducibility (unseen algorithms/pipelines, etc). These are two hurdles that currently prevent me from feeling reassured enough to use AI more than I currently do."
   *— From conversation 00068.md*

6. "Recently I worked on a project that concerned the use of variational autoencoder models on galactic spectra. It has been suggested that models of this type can be used to facilitate novel scientific discovery by focusing on what details a model chooses to learn. The variational autoencoder was then designed and trained on some synthetic galaxy spectra and the results of what it learnt were analysed."
   *— From conversation 00074.md*

7. "I really wanted to understand the mathematics behind what I was doing. With the report writing, coding was the easiest part of it. The mathematics was more challenging in that I had to refer to graduate level textbooks to understand what was going on. I also have ethical concerns when it comes to intellectual property, so I didn't want to use AI to write or rewrite something that is already present in a textbook or my professor's lecture notes."
   *— From conversation 00080.md*

8. "Yes. The effects of AI on the publication process are quite worrying, and the system is further shifting in favor of those who know how to game the system rather than those that have the best research to present. As AI inevitably grows in the grant and review process, it is important that the strong scientific practices can still prevail and that safeguards be in place"

## Future Perspectives

1. "Ultimately, I make the decisions, but I've utilized AI quite a bit in providing suggestions. When a suggestion doesn't work out the way it was expected, I just try a different approach. I also use a few different AI models to get comparisons."
   *— From conversation 00016.md*

2. "Before implementing it into to the master code, I tested it by giving it an input variable to output to excel and stepping line by line to see if it would create the spreadsheet and output that variable where I wanted. After a couple iterations using AI, I got exactly what I expected. From there I modified it further, so that it would work as intended in the master code."
   *— From conversation 00038.md*

3. "Time is my biggest driver. Of course I would expect there be a separate verification process the user would have to perform."
   *— From conversation 00038.md*

4. "It is quite a long process and requires a lot of reading and some intuition, I think you need a clear idea of what you want to do but how youre going to do it is the hard part. It requires a lot of experimenting and trial and error"
   *— From conversation 00054.md*

5. "Often in scientific research we have a great idea and make progress with said idea but reach a wall where we don't know how to proceed. If an AI model could help with this aspect of research, it would be fantastic. The problem is that often the best way forward is something that has never been done before so it's unrealistic to expect an AI tool to be consistently helpful for this."
   *— From conversation 00074.md*

6. "The outputs had to make sense obviously. I had a general idea for what I was expecting for the variance estimation for both methods. Since I had a good understanding of R programming, it was pretty straightforward for me to read through the code for any glaring issues. From what I remember, there were a couple of variables that I needed to rename and some loops that I needed to fix for my own purposes. So basically, I used AI to get a 80% complete framework, and I made my edits where I deemed it necessary."
   *— From conversation 00080.md*

7. "I had a gut feeling based on visuals what the results should be. I plotted all of the data first so I sort of knew what to expect. Of course there were some surprises, but that's how research works! I was also able to verify the results against Matlab which was helpful."
   *— From conversation 00088.md*

8. "You can integrate a 3rd party AI tool into JIRA as an add-on. From there you have the ability to create a test run based on predetermined stories, scenarios, or bugs that have already been created/logged in JIRA. Filters and search bars are available to improve searchability. Once you have included the necessary criteria you can then hit create and run and a test run will be generated."
