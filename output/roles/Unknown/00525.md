Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for two main purposes: brainstorming ideas and revising my writing.

AI: Tell me more about that. When you're brainstorming ideas, what does that process look like for you?

User: Whenever I have to come up with new material, I use AI to help find a starting point. For example, I am an Ethics Rep for my team, and every few months I have to facilitate a discussion about a topic relating to ethics, bonus points for a workplace nexus. I have asked AI in the past to come up with a few examples of real or hypothetical scenarios I could summarize to my time, and a few examples of discussion questions. It usually takes a few iterations of generating and refining ideas before I have one or two I'm really happy with.

AI: That's a fascinating use case. When you say it takes a few iterations of generating and refining ideas, what drives you to keep iterating? What are you looking for that tells you when an idea is one you're "really happy with"?

User: When an idea gives signals that it will work in my workplace, I put it in the parking lot and then do a few more runs. Once I have two or three ideas that are feasible, I pick the best one and improve it. With AI input.

AI: What signals tell you that an idea will work in your workplace? What makes an ethics scenario feasible for your specific team?

User: If it relates to a contemporary workplace issue, or something that is likely to occur. I work in a professional setting. Petty crime, theft, etc. are all pretty unlikely to happen, so they aren't really related to the workplace. Honestly, it's pretty hard to come up with genuine ethical dilemmas. Most "ethical dilemmas" are just a choice between a hard, but ethical, choice and an easier, but less ethical, choice.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction about ethical dilemmas. When you're working with AI to develop these scenarios, how do you guide it toward those more nuanced workplace situations versus the clearer-cut dilemmas it might initially suggest?

User: I tell it to reject some outright, and give me more that resemble the ones I haven't asked it to reject. I also tell AI that I want actual dilemmas, where the right answer isn't clear.

AI: You mentioned you also use AI for revising your writing. How does that process work for you, and how is it different from the brainstorming work you just described?

User: I don't usually take written products from AI and submit them as finished products, even ethical discussion topics and questions. I always take the AI output (ideas) and then put it into original words.
I do the same with most of my writing tasks, but in reverse. If I have to write an e-mail, a report, a performance evaluation, or anything, I produce a complete first draft (with or without AI brainstorming support) using my own words. I often edit as I write (removing repetition, improving phrasing, etc.) but, thanks to AI, I also leave awkward phrasing or imperfect sentences, knowing that AI does a pretty good job of cleaning that stuff up.

AI: That's an interesting workflow - writing your complete first draft knowing AI will help polish it later. What kinds of things does AI typically catch or improve when you hand it that rough first draft?

User: AI is excellent at improving grammar, although we occasionally disagree on punctuation. AI has a tendency to over-punctuate and include commas when they aren't strictly necessary (e.g. after "e.g." or before a conjunction that does not introduce an independent clause). AI is excellent at eliminating repetition by way of synonyms or rephrasing.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You've described this approach where you always write the first draft yourself and use your own words. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I've been writing for many years, and I've developed a voice that I quite like. AI doesn't write original material in my voice, and even struggles to preserve it in editing. For example, I never use en or em dashes; I much prefer semi-colons. I have two AI assistants I use regularly, and I have to constantly remind them to preserve my voice and avoid using dashes to indicate pauses or turnarounds.

AI: That's really interesting - you have to actively work to preserve your personal writing style. When you say you have to "constantly remind them" about things like avoiding dashes, how do you handle that in practice? Do you find yourself training the AI in each conversation, or have you found other ways to maintain your voice?

User: One LLM I use has memory, so it knows what I want when I give it an input, and most of the time it returns what I've asked for. But I've also told it many times to avoid em dashes, and it still uses them some times. I used to just say "no em dashes, as usual." Now, sometimes I get frustrated and say "NO EM DASHES EVER," or something to that effect.

AI: It sounds like there's some real friction there when the AI doesn't follow your established preferences. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: On the balance, I have to say I'm very satisfied with AI. Usually a reminder to get rid of the em dashes is all that it takes, and the fact that I get a read-over by AI is saving me hours of work. I would do that initial grammer/repetition proofread myself, if not for AI. Now, I can give it to AI, ask for a revision, and attend to another task so I have fresh eyes when I get it back. It's great.

AI: That's a great point about getting fresh eyes on your work. When you say it's saving you hours of work, how has that changed your overall work experience? What do you do with that time you've freed up?

User: More work. My job isn't the kind that you leave at the office, or are ever fully done. I just move on to the next mountain. But one thing I used to agonize over was how to strike the correct tone in an e-mail. I often write e-mails when I'm frustrated, and I'm not good at being subtle or tactful.....I've sent a few e-mails I wish I could take back. But now, I put those initial angry drafts into AI and ask for the message to be preserved, frustration to be conveyed, but the tone to be more polished and professional. It's changed the experience for the recipients, I'm sure.

AI: That sounds like a really valuable skill to have AI help with - managing that balance between conveying your message and maintaining professionalism. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Most people around me are also beginning to use AI in their day to day work. We talk about it at the office, sharing ideas and applications for AI. I'm probably a bit of a ringleader in integrating AI into my work, so I think I'm influencing more than being influenced. But it DID all start with a coworker showing me how much better his writing was when he turned to AI.

AI: That's fascinating - you started by learning from a colleague and now you're the one leading the charge. When you share ideas and applications with your colleagues at the office, what kinds of conversations come up? What do people get excited about or concerned about when discussing AI use?

User: People are exciting about streamlining workflows, automating processes, and having access to a powerful tool for improving their communications. People are concerned about ethics, the environment, harmful applications, or unchecked AI causing harm

AI: Those are really thoughtful considerations from your team. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do. For many reasons (some already mentioned), I still do most of my own writing and drafting. I'm not about to stop writing because AI can do some of that for me. I also always edit whatever AI gives me, so I'm preserving my editing skills (I have some experience editing). But I get a labor-free first pass now, which makes it more efficient! I have also been tempted to ask AI how to respond in uncertain human/relational interactions, but I usually avoid doing so. I don't have a strong rationale for it, but I think it's still important for me to be the one to both decide how I interact with others in the world, but also generate the ideas to guide those decisions. I don't want to forfeit social/relational intelligence.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making about social intelligence. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I suspect my workplace will begin to integrate AI into our software suites, so it will be easier to do what I'm already doing. That sounds good. I also look forward to more major productivity software embedding AI to help with the skills I don't care to develop (word processor and spreadsheet formatting and manipulation, for example).

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining your writing voice and your deliberate choice to preserve social intelligence in your interactions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's great. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency gains with preserving personal skills and voice will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. Have a great rest of your day!
