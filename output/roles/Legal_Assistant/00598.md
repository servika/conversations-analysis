Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a lawyer, I use AI for summarizing notes and for help with editing/drafting letters and long emails. I also use it sometimes for help revising briefs and motions to help make things more concise.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're working on those tasks - like summarizing notes or revising briefs - are there certain types of legal work you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, I still handle legal research myself because I don't have a lot of confidence with AI performing legal research and case law analysis at this time. It is a big issue currently in my profession.

AI: That makes a lot of sense given the current discussions in the legal profession about AI accuracy with case law. 

When you do use AI for those tasks you mentioned - the summarizing, drafting, and revising - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it throughout the process, and often will draft it myself and then see what AI comes up with, then add/change my draft accordingly. I basically use it as a "second set of eyes" to contribute things I hadn't thought of or to help with my writing.

AI: That "second set of eyes" approach sounds really thoughtful. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or practices around AI use in your legal environment?

User: Yes, in general we all want to use AI more in our practice, but there is hesitancy in general given the issues with hallucinations with case law and made up citations. There are trust issues with AI, but we are all trying to find ways that we can incorporate AI into our practice to improve efficiency.

AI: That tension between wanting efficiency gains and needing absolute accuracy makes complete sense in your field.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI helped me cut my brief length down to the maximum words allowed (it was too long, and I used AI to help me shorten it without taking out too much of the substance that I wanted to convey).

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of helpful collaboration you were describing earlier. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am not particularly concerned about AI "taking over" in the litigation field of law where I work, because while AI can definitely become a very helpful tool, it cannot replace the human element required to represent an injured client and take their case all the way to trial before a judge or a jury.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective on the irreplaceable human elements in litigation. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you personally or for your practice?

User: I would like to see AI continue to develop in the legal field and become better at research and have fewer hallucinations so that we can trust it to assist with research and writing, in the same sense that a legal assistant could.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a "second set of eyes" and your clear understanding of where human judgment remains irreplaceable in litigation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
