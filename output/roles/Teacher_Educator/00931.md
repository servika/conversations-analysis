Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Just one question before we begin - would it be ideal for me to use specific examples to reinforce my experiences or perspectives in response to the questions presented or just speak about them generally in terms of averages during my job?

AI: That's a great question! Specific examples would be incredibly valuable. When you can share concrete situations - like "last week when I was working on X project, I used AI to help with Y and here's what happened" - that gives us much richer insights than general patterns alone.

Those real moments help us understand not just what you do, but the context around it, how it felt, and what influenced your decisions. So please feel free to dive into specific instances whenever they come to mind.

Ready to get started?

User: Yes, I'm ready!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI fits into my regular workday in many ways. As a teacher, I rely on AI to help me save time and mental expenditure for administrative tasks such as writing emails, crafting replies to emails, brainstorming ideas for lessons or units. I also use it creatively to create posters, fliers, visuals for Google Classroom or for assignments to make them more interesting and personalized. I often use AI as a collaborative partner or an administrative assistant helping me save time or bounce ideas off of when I am feeling mentally drained and in the depths of decision fatigue.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of tasks. You mentioned using it as both a collaborative partner and an administrative assistant, which is interesting.

Can you walk me through a specific example of when you recently used AI as that collaborative partner? What was the situation and how did that interaction actually unfold?

User: Recently, I was trying to plan a unit in my English class with a classic piece of literature. The downside to using classic literature in classes now is the high degree students rely on academic dishonestly to complete their work and interact with this text. However, I think it has great, timeless themes that would really require them to question the world around them. So, I used AI to help me plan different creative solutions and adaptations to my current unit to help ensure I am accurately addressing the provincial curricular outcomes while also incorporating a fresh perspective that allows my students to be creative and practice critical thinking skills. I started by listing my priorities, ideas and focus for the unit and had AI collaborate with my ideas to develop them into concrete plans for me to edit.

AI: That's a fascinating challenge you're navigating - wanting to preserve those valuable themes while addressing the academic dishonesty issue. 

When you say you had AI "collaborate with your ideas to develop them into concrete plans," what did that back-and-forth actually look like? Were you going back and forth with suggestions, or did you present everything upfront and then work from there?

User: I would say both of those occurred throughout the conversation, but mainly I presented my ideas and suggestions upfront for the AI tool to prioritize during the conversation but later on, when I realized that I had to adapt a bit to modify one of my assignments to address a curriculuar outcome I had initially forgotten, I asked it to present me with some supplementary suggestions to help me work around my own mental roadblock. It was structured more as a "could you help me understand another way to see this" type of request.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you started with one interaction style and then shifted when you hit that mental roadblock. 

When you asked for help seeing things "another way," what was that mental roadblock specifically? What were you stuck on that made you turn to AI for a different perspective?

User: We were working with the initial idea for a group presentation assignment that requires collaboration. However, I overlooked the curricular outcome that requires students to present out loud. This is a more complicated request than it seems initially though. The students I have are very anxious and insecure, it becomes a huge problem for many of them to speak out loud in front of their peers and as someone who takes mental health and student success very seriously, I felt it was my responsibility to ensure I take that factor into account when making assignments that allow students to showcase their best work rather than being restricted by their anxiety. So, I asked for AI to help me brainstorm other ways to look at how to fulfill this criteria, how could they speak out loud without speaking out loud? Or what were creative solutions to ensure that I am being mindful of student's comfort levels while challenging them without pushing them too far.

AI: That's such a thoughtful dilemma - balancing curricular requirements with your students' well-being. It really shows how complex teaching decisions can be.

What kinds of solutions did the AI suggest for that "speak out loud without speaking out loud" challenge? And how did those suggestions land with you - were they things you hadn't considered, or did they help you build on ideas you already had brewing?

User: AI suggested many different options in different categories. I remember there being two main categories, one had students speaking outloud in small groups to reduce anxiety and then presented different adaptations and suggestions for students who were more or less comfortable with speaking including partner work or scripts with fill-in-the-blank suggestions. The other category had students "speaking" out loud in more non-traditional ways but in front of the whole group, such as pre-recording their presentation as a video or podcast, using mime techniques, presenting individually to just me. I would say many of these ideas are ones that I've come across previously in my teaching career, but one difficulty is just remembering them all. There are so many teaching ideas out there, it is nice to have someone - AI in this case - remind you of all the options so you aren't exhausting yourself looking back into your notes or the depths of the web to recall them all. There were a few unique ideas though that I hadn't see or hadn't seen often used before though.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI was serving almost like an external memory bank, helping you access ideas you knew but couldn't pull up in that moment of decision fatigue.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, definitely. There are a few things I could ask for help with that I prefer to handle on my own. One example is classroom management, I know many teachers ask for help brainstorming or advice even on how to respond to difficult student behaviours. However, I prefer to handle those personally. I trust my instincts, professional judgement and extensive experience to respond in a way that feels authentic for me. I think that is key for developing a strong rapport with your students - it really requires developing your instincts and also showing them your human emotions. This is different for me because I have a specific ratio of emotion to logic that I apply to those situations. It's great to have a brainstorm but it becomes so hard to rely on trusting yourself to respond appropriately if you always rely on help with how to respond in difficult moments.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's something about maintaining that authentic connection and trusting your own judgment in those interpersonal moments. The way you describe that "specific ratio of emotion to logic" sounds like something very personal that you've developed over time.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Again, I would say I definitely use both of patterns frequently. There are basic tasks that I just need off my plate and save me tons of time. For example, asking AI to reword a multiple choice exam and rearrange the questions to create another version (to cut down on academic dishonesty) and there are other times where I'm looking for a brainstorming partner and I need help with a "what are my options to address this" kind of task. For example, rather than using a worksheet I will ask for help brainstorming more interactive options to accomplish the same goal.

AI: You've mentioned academic dishonesty a couple of times now - it seems like that's a real consideration in how you're designing your teaching. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people openly discussing these tools, or is it more something you've figured out on your own?

User: That is a difficult question. I would say both, students are very interested in AI and are so exploratory when it comes to new technology and definitely the kinds that can serve as shortcuts. Unfortunately, it is rare to see students using AI for good or appropriate uses. So that does separate my colleagues into two camps. There are those of us who have embraced the power of this technology for our own good and for the good of our students - I would say there are few of us, including myself who are in that camp which largely means I do a lot of trying new tools and learning about them on my own. There are still many teachers, mainly the ones who have been teaching a long time, who don't think AI is useful or appropriate for schools. This is hard to hear since it can be so helpful but when their only experiences of AI are students using it to cheat on exams and essays, I guess it makes sense why they remain so closed minded about the possibility of this technology.

AI: That divide you're describing sounds challenging to navigate - being in that smaller camp that sees the potential while watching students misuse the technology in ways that reinforce your colleagues' concerns.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would say my experiences have been mainly satisfied to be honest. I had a student who was struggling with improving his writing from a satisfactory level to an exemplary level. He just wasn't understanding the feedback he was continuously given on his essays, so it felt like passively reviewing what he wrote and pointing out his mistakes just wasn't getting through to him. So I had this idea where I asked him to rate three paragraphs. One paragraph was his own, but I asked AI to rewrite the same paragraph with the same content at each of the other rubric levels. This really got through to him and helped him both see what specific improvements he could make to fulfill higher levels on the rubric but also he could see that AI spoke about the literature too generally, he noticed that his example was more specific in a way the other paragraphs were not. This ended up being a really well-rounded lesson about how to improve his writing on his own and how we should not rely on AI to do it for him.

AI: That's such a clever use of AI - turning it into a teaching tool to help the student see the differences in quality levels. It sounds like it worked on multiple levels, both showing him concrete improvements and highlighting where his own work had strengths.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would say that this is definitely something that many people have concerns about, but I don't agree. I think, specifically for teaching, that this is not something I'm worried about. There is always a place in education for technology, I would say it is an essential component, but it doesn't replace how important human interactions are for students.

AI: That confidence in the irreplaceable human element of teaching is really interesting. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as the technology develops?

User: I would love to see the relationship with AI develop and become fully integrated into part of our workload for teaching. Currently, teachers are asked to do an obscene amount of work within very limited paid hours and honestly, its so overwhelming and discouraging that so many teachers end up with premature burnout within their first few years of teaching. Seeing a future where we could rely on AI to help lift that heavy load and improve efficiency would be ideal for teachers currently and also to keep teachers healthy in the profession for long careers.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as that external memory bank to recall teaching strategies, and that creative example of helping your student understand rubric levels by comparing his work to AI-generated versions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just a note - I really appreciate the emphasis on making more educational tools available. Specifically, the ones geared towards professions like teaching. Seeing tools that are specifically made to help teachers with assessment, marking, lesson planning are really essential to the future of this technology. I am also really glad to see measures beginning to be taken to prevent it from being a shortcut for students to avoid critical thinking. These are both really important to the future of the relationship that we have with AI in the teaching profession.

AI: Thank you so much for that additional insight - the need for profession-specific tools and the balance between supporting teachers while preventing student misuse is clearly something you've thought deeply about.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective on navigating that divide between colleagues, finding creative ways to use AI as a teaching tool itself, and thinking about the future sustainability of the profession has been incredibly valuable. Your insights will be really helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and thanks again for participating in our research.
