Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hi, that all sounds good thanks

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for a range of things. We have co-pilot, so I will use that to make a draft of meeting notes and to help me write documents. For example, if I want something I've written to be more clear or be in a more formal tone. I also use other AI tools to help with research.

AI: That sounds like AI is integrated into several different parts of your workflow. When you mention using it for research, what does that look like in practice? How do you typically approach research tasks with AI tools?

User: For example, if I want to understand particular legal provisions or information about a particular jurisdiction, I'll use something like Chat GPT and type in relevant key words. That will then generate some information that I'll use as 'leads' to then delve further myself.

AI: Interesting - so you're using AI as a starting point to identify leads, then doing the deeper research yourself. That suggests you have a particular approach to dividing up the work. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Depending on what I need the info for, I would need to verify the information provided, but the AI model will give me starting points. So I'm not starting from a blank page

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it to get past that initial blank page hurdle. 

When you do use AI for work tasks like drafting documents or meeting notes, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It's both really. With meeting notes, I will usually ask it to do the first summary and I'll then check and edit. When preparing a document I tend to be more collaborative - e.g., giving a particular paragraph to rephrase or data set to analyse

AI: So it sounds like the complexity or nature of the task influences how you work with it - more delegation for straightforward summarization, but more back-and-forth collaboration for document preparation. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes, it is fairly widely embraced where I work - and actually I saw how it was helping some of my colleagues before I started using it myself

AI: That's helpful context - seeing colleagues use it successfully seems to have influenced your adoption. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I had to write an article for our intranet at work and was up against a tight deadline. I wrote a rough outline quickly and gave the AI instructions to finesse it. I then made further edits myself. The whole approach saved a large amount of time with a professional sounding output, so that was a satisfying outcome

AI: That sounds like a really effective partnership - you handled the strategic thinking and structure, while AI helped with the refinement under time pressure.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not overly concerned personally as the information I deal with tends to be very complex and nuanced and I think it would be challenging for an AI to grasp all the intracasies in a human like way. I can see it being more of an issue in more junior roles, like customer services teams who need to respond to enqiries

AI: That's an insightful distinction - you see the complexity and nuance of your work as providing a natural boundary, while recognizing the potential impact on different types of roles.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Yes, I would like to integrate it even more into my work so it takes the bulk of 'routine' tasks away. It would be helpful to use it for generating enquiry responses, which can be time consuming and for generating FAQ lists.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI as a starting point for research to avoid the blank page problem, and how you adapt your collaboration style based on the complexity of the task.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's everything thanks. It was nice to chat!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about how you strategically divide tasks with AI - using it for leads and refinement while maintaining control over the complex, nuanced work - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It was great chatting with you too. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
