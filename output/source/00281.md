Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's go

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it  mainly for web research, coding in Python, and repetitive tasks I'd rather not do in Excel, like table rearanging

AI: That's a helpful overview. Let me dig a bit deeper into the web research part - what does that process typically look like for you? Walk me through how you approach using AI for research tasks.

User: I give it the research brief and ask the AI to find sources

AI: Tell me more about what happens after the AI finds those sources for you. How do you work with what it gives you?

User: I check them first, and then, if the links are correct and the extracted data is also correct, I put them in my draft report

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: It's not that I prefer doing a task myself. I like the fact that AI can comb the internet before me and come up with possible sources. I use AI web research as an addition to my web research

AI: That's an interesting perspective - using AI as an addition rather than a replacement. When you do your own web research after the AI has done its part, what are you looking for that the AI might have missed?

User: More sources, the AI generally uses generic search terms. I refine the process by using sources I already know or just change the keywords

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually collaborate with AI. I may sometimes delegate complete tasks, but those are usually repetitive tasks or simple math, or text extraction, etc

AI: Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like? Walk me through a recent time when you worked back and forth with AI on something.

User: Let's say I have a task where I have to select 35+ years old footballers from top european leagues and then find recent articles where they ask specific questions. I'll ask the AI to find the footballers names. Then I'll check a few sources to make sure all the relevant names are included. And then I'll delegate the task to the AI so it would find the articles I am interested in

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not significantly, I found the benefits of AI mostly by myself

AI: That suggests you've been pretty independent in exploring AI's potential. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Probably the first time I used it. I needed to create code for data extraction from a web source.  Within an hour I was able to get the complete working code. As for frustrating experiences, it's usually when the AI randomly changes the code after longer conversations, requiring me to go back and ask for an earlier answer to be regenerated

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am considering to acquire new skills

AI: What kinds of new skills are you thinking about acquiring? What's driving those choices for you?

User: Some high level of AI usage, or other skills where AI would have a hard time, like highly skilled work involving manual labor

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: For now, it is quite useful. We'll see in the future

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as an addition to your own research rather than a replacement, and how you've independently discovered its benefits.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That was just about everything I use AI so far

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you collaborate with AI - especially that example of the footballer research task and how you balance AI assistance with your own expertise - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
