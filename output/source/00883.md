Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready to begin and have no questions!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well I'm a middle school teacher, so I use AI for many purposes. This includes lesson planning, creating assignment sheets, creating test questions, summarizing texts, creating discussion questions or essay questions, creating exemplars, brainstorming ideas, and creating images, among others.

AI: That's quite a range of uses! It sounds like AI has become integrated into many different aspects of your teaching preparation.

When you're working on lesson planning specifically, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you and the AI work together on that task?

User: I provide the AI model with key details of my teaching situations. I am a Grade 9 Social Studies teacher in Alberta, so I indicate to the model that I need a Gr 9 lesson plan using the Alberta curriculum, and that my classes are 53 minutes long. I usually provide them with the specific topic that I want the lesson to centre on, and the basic components I am looking for (i.e. introduction, main activities, exit slip/activity). I usually don't provide two much more detail than that and see what the model comes up with. From there I will either ask the model to completely redo the lesson plan if I do not like it, or I'll ask for modifications or new activities as I see fit.

AI: That's a really clear process - you're giving the AI the framework and letting it generate the content, then refining from there. 

When you mentioned that sometimes you ask the model to completely redo the lesson plan, what typically makes you decide a plan isn't working? What are you looking for that tells you it's not quite right?

User: Well I'd say the main reason that I ask for new activities is that the suggested ones just don't seem fun and engaging. Often times the suggestions are quite boring and basic; in other words they are expected and something I could come up with myself. I am usually using AI to create lesson plans when I am stuck or want something out of the box. I will also ask the model to redo a lesson if the activities are not appropriate or engaging for my grade level. Or, sometimes I just want to see more options, rather than just accepting the first response that I get

AI: That's really insightful - you're looking for AI to push beyond what you'd naturally come up with yourself, especially when you're feeling stuck creatively.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I know that there are AI models that can create slide shows, but this is something that I definitely like to handle myself. I want to make sure that those are aesthetic and well-formatted, and I'm not sure an AI could do this. I'm also quite a perfectionist and want things done a certain way. I also don't use AI to write things that I want to be personalized to students. For example, we write farewell cards to our graduating students and I prefer to write these myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the personal touch and your own aesthetic standards really matter for those tasks.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you start with giving it parameters and then refine from there. Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate with it. For example, if I am asking for test questions, I will ask for refinements to increase the level of challenge or complexity, or make the distractors for a multiple choice question more difficult. I use AI to create assignment sheets and these are never exactly how I want them right off the bat, so they require lots of little tweaks along the way. My typical interactions definitely are to provide parameters and refine from there.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds like it's become a natural part of your workflow.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other teachers at your school using it similarly, or have you navigated this mostly on your own?

User: There are definitely other teachers using it and have encouraged me to use it. I would say I'm somewhere in the middle in terms of my willingness to utilize AI tools. There were definitely teachers using it well before me, and even now there are many times I am talking with coworkers about being stuck for ideas and they remind me to use AI. Or I'm completing a task and they say "Hey, you should use AI for that!" There are definitely a lot of us that will share tech tips including new AI tools. At the same time, I think that there are some teachers who are probably using it minimally, whether that's because they just don't know about it's various uses or they are older and maybe a bit more reluctant.

AI: It sounds like you have a really supportive environment where colleagues are actively sharing tips and reminding each other about AI possibilities. That's interesting that you see yourself in the middle of the adoption spectrum.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One that comes to mind right away is when I realized that AI could make images. I started to make cover pages for some of my assignment sheets that are personalized to my school. For example, I incorporated our school logo (an animal) and the Canadian Parliament building to make a really cool graphic for a mock Parliament assignment that I do. It was very satisfying because having personalized resources is something that I think can set apart teachers, and I think it's just fun for the students. Recently I had a frustrating experience trying to generate images, however. I wanted to make a Google Classroom banner for my online classrooms. The images created were awesome, but the photo had to be formatted to an exact size, and the model just wasn't getting it. The results were not even close. There are only so many ways you can ask for an exact size of an image, so that was definitely frustrating because it felt like I couldn't get through to the model and that there was no way I could get the desired result, even though I felt that this should have been a very simple task. If I am giving exact measurements I believe that this should be easy for the model.

AI: That's such a perfect example of the highs and lows! The satisfaction of creating something personalized and unique for your students, but then hitting that wall where the AI just couldn't understand what seemed like a straightforward request about image dimensions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Hmm I don't think I've actually ever really considered that. I feel that the way I currently use AI is more to compliment what I am already doing in the classroom rather than replace. I still do much of this work by myself, but use AI to simplify the process, or do things that I wouldn't be doing anyways. For example, last year I used AI to create a student exemplar for a five paragraph essay. It was the first time that I had given the specific essay prompt, so I had no other examples from previous students. I definitely would not have written the exemplar myself, so it was great to have the help of AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - using AI to do things you wouldn't have done otherwise rather than replacing tasks you'd normally handle yourself. The exemplar example is perfect for that.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you get more comfortable with it, or as new capabilities emerge?

User: Yes I definitely see my relationship with AI continuing to grow and evolve. I feel like it is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many different AI-based tools and resources that are out there that I am just learning about and I'm sure many that I have no idea about. For example, I have heard that there are resources where you can create podcasts for students based of your notes. So you input slide shows into the AI and they will create podcasts. I also have used a AI tool for grading once, and I would like to explore that a bit more. I would say that now the "floodgates are open" and I will consistently be looking for ways to make my life easier and the quality of my resources better.

AI: That's fascinating - AI-generated podcasts from your slide shows and AI-assisted grading sound like they could really transform different parts of your teaching workflow. The "floodgates are open" phrase really captures that sense of discovery.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a complement rather than a replacement, and how you're looking for it to push beyond what you'd naturally come up with yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I don't think so. Thanks for the opportunity!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the balance between efficiency and personalization, and how supportive workplace culture can encourage adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to participate in this interview. Have a great rest of your day!
