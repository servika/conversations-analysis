Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great. No questions from me.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For marketing, AI typically fits in when I need some tasks done quickly that aren't overly complicated. I work in social media so some tasks I ask AI to do are: Find grammatical or spelling errors in a blog post, come up with good blog post titles using certain keywords, fitting in another keyword into a new heading or naturally within the blog post, come up with easy captions for social media posts, come up with different variations of an alt tag, write product descriptions with certain keywords, etc.

AI: That's a really helpful overview of your AI usage in social media marketing. It sounds like you're using it for a range of content-related tasks.

Tell me more about what makes these tasks good fits for AI in your workflow. What is it about these particular activities that makes you think "this is something I should hand to AI"?

User: These are good tasks for AI because they're easy enough to adjust. For example, a lot of AI written work can sound robotic, but once you have the premise of what the chatbot is saying, you can rewrite it in a more human-like manner. Another reason these are great jobs for AI is because they wouldn't make or break your job performance. Now if someone was trying to do all of their work in AI, then there would be a problem. But these are small tasks on the grand scale of my job. It's also nice to pass off some of this work to AI because it can come up with many ideas in seconds that could save you hours which improves efficiency in the workplace. This also makes it easier to weed out bad ideas and enhance good ones.

AI: That's a really insightful way of thinking about it - using AI for tasks that are adjustable and won't make or break your performance. I'm particularly interested in what you said about weeding out bad ideas and enhancing good ones.

Can you walk me through what that process looks like for you? How do you decide which of AI's suggestions are worth keeping versus which ones to discard?

User: For example, if I ask AI to come up with 50 blog titles surrounding the different styles of sunglasses, not all of them are going to be winners, but some of them will be good and in order to make them great sometimes I'm combining two different blog titles into one and I can have AI do that for me. So then I'm asking it to come up with 10 different blog titles that combine two of the previous good ones. Then I can further make it better by having it add additional SEO keywords or having it reword it. This is sometimes a process but it gives you the opportunity to go back and forth like you're collaborating with a coworker without having to bug your coworkers.

AI: That's a fascinating collaborative process you've described - going back and forth with AI like you would with a coworker. It sounds like you're treating it more as an iterative partnership than just delegating a complete task.

When you're in that back-and-forth mode with AI, how does that feel compared to actually collaborating with a human coworker? Are there things that work better or worse about that dynamic?

User: There are good and bad days when collaborating with AI. Maybe some days I'm not explaining things as effectively as I normally would which hurts the outcome or makes it take longer. Sometimes it seems like more of an effort because you have to explain everything to a chatbot whereas your coworkers usually know what you're working on, or what the premise of your job is, or what the company is trying to achieve. In those cases, it would be easier to collaborate with a coworker but when all of this information isn't needed, then AI comes in handy.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the context that coworkers already have versus having to explain everything from scratch to AI. It sounds like there's a real trade-off between convenience and the setup time required.

You mentioned there are good and bad days collaborating with AI. Can you think of a specific time recently when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A certain bad day I had with AI was when I was trying to come up with a list of some really good captions for some social media posts. The chatbot was sounding very robotic that day no matter what I told it to do. Sometimes AI gets stuck on using certain words that no one really uses in their day to day life so then the captions start sounding fake which could lead to our SEO not being as affective as it should be.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - when AI gets stuck using those unnatural words and you can't seem to break it out of that pattern no matter how you adjust your prompts.

What about on the flip side? Can you think of a time when working with AI left you feeling particularly satisfied or like it really clicked?

User: I would say it works best when I give it tasks where it is forces to think more and do more research. For example, if I wanted AI to come up with a blog outline focused on different styles of sunglasses - this is easier for it rather than trying to sound like a human. This is when I enjoy using AI

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI performs better for you when you're leveraging its research and organizational capabilities rather than asking it to mimic human tone and voice.

I'm curious about your colleagues and workplace culture. How have they influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself using it more or less because of how others approach it?

User: I think in the beginning I was more or less discouraged from using it because AI seemed a little taboo in the workplace. Employers want to get their money's worth from their employees and when they find out that their using AI it can be taken as if they're not really doing their job. Once my boss started using it herself to see how useful it is but still know that she had to give it the base of its ideas, then that's when she became less of a stickler for it so now I tend to use it more.

AI: That's a really telling shift - from AI being taboo to your boss recognizing its value once she tried it herself and saw that it still requires human input and direction.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really concern you given how you're using it?

User: Where I excel over AI is my quickness to know social norms and viral things on social media. I tend to notice that AI is slow on these things because not a lot of websites are writing blog posts or articles about social media trends, they're just being posted on social media. So this part of my job does concern me but nothing more than my company being able to find someone younger who is more in tune with the trends. The value in my work comes from getting the jobs done, not the sources I use to do it, because then that could be said about any position and then my bosses would have to use AI to get my job done when they don't want to do any part of my job to begin with. If that makes sense. I think people who are in fields where they're doing a lot of writing should be concerned. Copywriters specifically.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - your expertise in recognizing social trends and cultural moments is something that's really hard for AI to replicate, especially when those trends are happening in real-time on platforms rather than in written articles.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently a year from now, or do you think you'll stick with the approach you've developed?

User: I think my approach has worked great for me so far and I can see myself continuing to use it this way, however it all depends on the development of AI. Where its expertise is growing and where I can implement it into my work is very nuanced currently.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to approach it - staying flexible as the technology develops while sticking with what's working well for you now.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that collaborative back-and-forth process with AI and your point about excelling in areas like social trends that AI struggles with.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced ways you integrate AI into your social media marketing work - from the collaborative iterative process to navigating workplace culture shifts - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
