Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

If you're ready, I'd love to start by hearing about how AI fits into your typical workday. What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Yes, that sounds good! My primary job is funeral directing as well as office management. I help to prepare the deceased prior to final disposition, but am also responsible for a great deal of clerical work and business management, which I find AI helps with a great deal.

AI: That's fascinating - you work in such an important and specialized field. It sounds like AI is helping you with the business side of your work. 

Could you tell me more about the specific clerical and business management tasks where you find AI most helpful? I'm curious about what those look like in your day-to-day work.

User: Sure! One of my most favorite features is help with obituary writing. I am able to put in some vital statistical information, little bits of info I've picked up from family members, etc., and I have been beyond pleased with the outcomes. It's saved me an immense amount of time, and I've received no complaints from the families so far.

AI: That sounds like such a meaningful use of AI - helping families honor their loved ones through well-crafted obituaries. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're working on an obituary, how do you typically interact with AI? Do you find yourself going back and forth with it to refine the writing, or does it usually get close to what you need on the first try?

User: Usually I'll do a little bit of back and forth just so I can get the wording and tone just right. Another thing I love about it is that it can adjust word limits on its own, which is a real pain to figure out and having to reword everything. Most newspapers charge for published obituaries by the character, so when the families request an exact character count, AI comes in handy big time.

AI: That's such a practical example of how AI can handle those tedious details that would otherwise eat up your time. The character count feature sounds like it saves you from a lot of manual editing.

When you're going back and forth to get the tone just right, what are you usually looking for? What makes an obituary feel like it captures the person and family well?

User: Usually it's just based on my meeting with the family. Some prefer more elaborate obituaries, which is where AI comes into play. I also use it for other things, though, like scheduling, Accounts Payable, keeping up with decedents' physical conditions/subsequent procedures, writing emails, and also a resource to learn about new cases that I'm unfamiliar with.

AI: It sounds like AI has become quite integrated across different aspects of your work - from the more personal side with obituaries to the operational tasks like scheduling and accounts payable.

When you mention using it as a resource to learn about new cases you're unfamiliar with, could you tell me more about that? What kinds of situations come up where you need that kind of support?

User: Usually when I experience a case where I'm unfamiliar with the decedent's current state in order to determine the type of care that needs to be afforded to them. For instance, we had a decedent in very bad shape, and after describing her condition and medical history, I was able to heed its advice (she had high blood pressure and fluid retention among a slew of other ailments, so aspiration was deemed necessary, which resulted in a positive outcome). In cases like those, it's helpful to see if a case is truly unsalvageable or if there's underlying causes which collectively contribute to their physical state.

AI: That's a really important application - using AI to help you understand the underlying medical factors that affect the care you can provide. It sounds like it helps you make more informed decisions about the preparation process.

Are there aspects of your work where you prefer to rely on your own expertise and experience, even though AI might be able to help? What makes those areas different for you?

User: Obviously when I can see the decedent first hand and can assess on my own, but sometimes that extra confirmation is nice, especially when I'm working alone.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that confirmation when you're working independently sounds really valuable, especially in such a specialized field where every decision matters.

When you do use AI for that kind of consultation, could you describe how that interaction typically unfolds? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the assessment process, or do you tend to present it with a complete situation and get its analysis?

User: Usually I'll ease into it with just a simple question, and it builds from that. I oftentimes remember to tell the AI to take on the persona of a funeral director, embalmer, or other expert in the field prior to asking.

AI: That's interesting that you ask it to take on that professional persona first. It sounds like that helps you get more relevant guidance.

I'm curious about how your workplace culture or colleagues have influenced the way you use AI. Have they been supportive of you incorporating these tools, or has it been more of an individual decision on your part?

User: For the most part, my coworkers only utilize when required, apart from writing obituaries and emails. I have multiple roles, though, and also work in our business management/financial sector, so I tend to use AI a bit more than most.

AI: It sounds like you've found more applications for AI because of your diverse responsibilities across both the funeral directing and business management sides.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've only found myself getting frustrated when my queries are erroneously flagged. Due to the sensitive nature of my field, I suppose I can understand, but it does get frustrating when I'm asking a potentially sensitive question with good intentions. That, and its memory isn't always the most reliable. When I've asked it to recall certain information, it's actually misquoted me before.

AI: That sounds really frustrating, especially when you're trying to do your job well and help families during difficult times. Those flagging issues must be particularly challenging given the sensitive but legitimate nature of your work.

How do you think about maintaining your own skills and expertise in areas where AI is becoming more helpful? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is, and it's something that certainly crosses my mind. Since I use AI so often in my day-to-day work routine, it makes me feel somewhat replaceable. I've found myself focusing more on my hands-on activities, partly because I've got AI to lessen the burden of my clerical workload, but because I know that my interpersonal skills are something that make me unique.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing that your interpersonal skills and hands-on expertise are uniquely human qualities that can't be replaced.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops or as you get more comfortable with it?

User: I definitely see AI becoming more of an asset in my field. With time, I'd imagine more of my coworkers will likely use it as well (beyond what they're currently expected to anyway), and once that happens, I foresee my company enforcing its use company wide.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with the delicate work of obituary writing and your awareness of how it's changing your role while you focus on your unique interpersonal skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing comes to mind at this time!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in funeral directing - from obituary writing to case consultation - have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. 

It's been really valuable to understand how AI can support such important and sensitive work while you maintain focus on the irreplaceable human elements of what you do.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
