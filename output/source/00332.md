Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds all good and I'm ready to answer some questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI quite a lot in my day-to-day. I work for a church, and that comes with a variety of tasks at any given time. Tasks I use AI for at work:

* Generating well-worded emails to fellow members of staff, members of our church, volunteers or outside persons.
* I use it to help me research notes and explain the bible when preparing sermons for Sundays when I'm down to preach.
* I use it to generate WhatsApp messages for group chats
* I use it for email templates for volunteers.
* I use it for content generation when wanting to motivate my volunteers, whether in person or via means of communication.
* I use it to help draft vision documents, help with rotas for volunteers, Google Sheet ideas and so on.
* I use it to help me bounce off thoughts when needing to engage in conflict situations.

AI: That's a fascinating range of applications across so many different aspects of your work. It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your role at the church.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I'd say the thing I most prefer doing is my sermon writing, however, I must confess I have used it from time to time to take my ideas and generate a sermon which I'm not happy doing as I feel like I need to have embodied what the bible has said and what needs communicating.

I also would love to use it more for data generation and creation of graphs and sheets but I don't always find the AI I use capable of doing that so I just do it myself which takes so long.

AI: That's really insightful, especially what you shared about sermon writing. It sounds like there's something important to you about personally embodying the message - that personal connection seems crucial for that particular task.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I find myself doing both if I'm honest. Depending on the task, I will either begin a task with it and work together throughout, whereas there are some tasks I now delegate on a regular basis (this is often repeated tasks that I don't want to start from scratch every week but require minor updated tweaks to reflect the Sunday services coming up.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having different approaches for different types of tasks. It sounds like the repeated weekly tasks have become more delegated over time, while other work stays collaborative.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yeah that's exactly it.

To be honest, they haven't. I'd say I'm the one who uses it the most and is trying to influence them to use it more.

AI: Interesting - so you're actually the pioneer in your workplace when it comes to AI adoption. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: You could say that haha.

It made me feel really satisfied when I was able to create a very practical handover document for a ministry I used to run for another staff member to use. I was able to essentially brain dump all information and knowledge I had and it was able to help me pull it together in a really clear and helpful way.

In terms of frustration I've been angry when I've been doing a task such as trying to create a decent CSV file for Google Sheets but it keeps getting things wrong regardless of how clear my prompt was. Eventually I give up because it feels stupid.

AI: That handover document example really highlights how powerful AI can be when it works well - taking all your institutional knowledge and organizing it coherently sounds incredibly valuable for your colleague.

The CSV frustration is telling too - it sounds like when the AI doesn't understand the task properly, it can feel like you're hitting a wall.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: To be honest I don't think AI will replace me as a Pastor. The whole role is to be with people and church members need you to pray with them, care for them and so much more. I think as a pastor if I use AI and up my skills with it it can save me so much time on the admin side which will free me up to be with the people.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as a way to handle the administrative burden so you can focus more on the pastoral care that's at the heart of your calling.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I feel like it will get better but I have to have good boundaries in place like any relationship. I don't want to become so dependent on AI that I can't live without or do what I'm called to do. So I'd like to make sure I learn to steward it well whilst developing my skills in how to use it. But I do see myself using it more and my skillset evolving.

AI: That's a really wise approach - thinking about stewardship and maintaining healthy boundaries while still growing in how you use the tool.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can free you up for the relational aspects of ministry that are at the core of your calling, and your thoughtful approach to boundaries.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes - I think we are going to reach a point in the Christian and Church world where we will have to help people learn and discern that AI is not the voice of God. It is a tool to use for ministry not to act as God.

AI: That's a profound observation and something I wouldn't have thought to ask about. The distinction between AI as a tool versus something with spiritual authority seems like it could be a really important conversation in religious communities as AI becomes more prevalent.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in ministry while maintaining those important boundaries and the centrality of human connection have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
