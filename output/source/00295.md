Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope ready when you are!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do a lot of repair and resurfacing/repainting of older homes, and use AI to help make decisions about what products to use, what kind of repairs would be best for specific situations

AI: That's really interesting - using AI for those kinds of technical decisions in home repair work. 

Tell me more about that. When you're facing a specific repair situation, what does that process of working with AI actually look like?

User: OK, so I'm repairing a porch that was neglected for decades, there are holes in the soffits where wood is rotted. I'll describe a particular area or take a photo and ask what the best course of action might be, or if its even repairable

AI: So you're bringing AI right to the job site in real time. When you describe the situation or share photos with AI, what kinds of responses do you typically get back? How useful are those recommendations for your actual repair work?

User: They're actually extremely helpful. I don't have lots of experience doing this work, and I work solo so don't have a more experienced guy to tell me what to do. Before AI, I would have to scroll endlessly through youtube videos trying to find a somewhat similar situation, but of course it was never exactly the same situation I was dealing with.

AI: That sounds like a real game-changer for someone working solo without that experienced mentor figure. 

I'm curious - are there situations where you get AI advice but then decide to do something different based on what you see in person? What drives those decisions when you deviate from the AI recommendations?

User: Oh yeah, AI doesn't always quite get what I'm working with, or its suggestions sometimes go against the experience I do have. If it suggests something I know from experience isn't a good strategy, I'm going to go with my past experience

AI: That makes perfect sense - you're using your judgment to filter the AI advice through your own experience. 

When you do override the AI's suggestions based on what you've learned from past jobs, how do you think about building that knowledge versus relying on AI guidance? Do you see them as working together, or is there tension there?

User: I'm not sure i understand what you mean by "how do you think about building that knowledge versus relying on AI guidance?"

AI: Let me clarify that - I'm wondering about how you view developing your own expertise while also having AI as a resource. 

For instance, do you find yourself actively trying to learn and remember things so you'll know them for future jobs, or are you more comfortable knowing you can just ask AI when similar situations come up again?

User: Oh no, my primary drive is always learning and remembering and expanding my own personal offline knowledge. I love this kind of work as a kind of art form, or like as an ever developing skillset. I want to just know and understand what to do on my own. But of course there is always more to learn, so I see AI as something I would contiinue to use on the job, but my questions will become ever more sophisticated and nuanced as a learn more.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - viewing the work as an art form and seeing AI as helping you ask increasingly sophisticated questions as your expertise grows. 

Can you give me an example of how your questions to AI have evolved? Maybe comparing something you might have asked when you first started using it versus the kind of question you'd ask now?

User: Sure, when I started I might have asked what a good brand of exterior paint for a particular kind of siding would be. Now I know the best brands for most situations, but now I might ask if I should sand a particular surface up to 150 or 220 grit, and what the advantages and issues for each would be.

AI: That evolution from basic product recommendations to nuanced technical decisions really illustrates your growing expertise. 

When you're in the middle of a job and collaborating with AI on these more sophisticated questions - like that sanding grit decision - do you typically work through the entire problem with AI step by step, or do you tend to get the information and then handle the execution completely on your own?

User: Well if its a process I've done enough times...like sanding...I only need to know one or two things and can handle 95% of execution on my own. But if its something new to me...like for a real example this week I'm about to re-glaze some very old and historic big windows...I've never glazed a window in my life, so I'm going to sit down with the AI and go through everything I can think of, every issue that might come up, step by step before I start.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - using AI tactically for specific details on familiar work versus comprehensively for completely new processes like the window glazing.

Have your colleagues or clients - or even just the broader culture in your line of work - influenced how you approach using AI? Do other people in construction and repair work talk about or use AI tools similarly?

User: Most guys I know in the trade are not big users of AI at all...I'd say 50% don't really use it for anything work related. Then maybe 35% use it occassionally, and 15% use it almost daily (but maybe just once or twice a day). I definitely use it more than average. No one else influenced how I use it because I used it way before anyone else I know, and I do most of my work solo these days

AI: So you've been a bit of a pioneer in your field with AI adoption. Given that you use it more than most in your trade, can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, this past winter my landlord wanted to see if I could make the house hold heat better (its a 120 year old house with oil heat, so expensive heat bills that she pays). I didn't know a thing about what to do, but told her I could do it. I described the situation to and asked GPT, and got a lot of great suggestions, which we developed and iterated on to suit budget, etc. and in the end lowered her heat bill about 35%, which was far better than I expected.

AI: That's a great success story - going from knowing nothing about energy efficiency to achieving a 35% reduction in heating costs. That must have felt incredible.

On the flip side, have you had any particularly frustrating experiences with AI on the job? Times when it maybe led you astray or didn't understand what you were dealing with?

User: Frustration points would be getting the AI to understand exactly what I'm working with...I either have to do a lot of typing explaining the physical situation or try to get it to understand with photos, which can be hit or miss.

AI: That communication challenge sounds like it could really slow you down when you're trying to get quick guidance on a job site.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as you continue building your skills, or maybe as the technology itself improves?

User: I am sort of an AI optimist (at least as far as capabilities go) and I always envision the technology getting a LOT better...I keep up on AI developments, blogs, etc. and so I expect orders of magnitude jumps so that in a year or two, it will be like having the greatest repair expert on earth with me all the time. I was pretty disappointed with the latest GPT (5)...it felt like a step backward so I've been re-thinking my expectations lately, unfortunately.

AI: That's really insightful - you've been following the technology closely enough to notice when updates don't meet your expectations. It sounds like you had high hopes for GPT-5 based on the trajectory you were seeing.

Those are all the main questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience as an early adopter using AI for skilled trade work. I particularly found it interesting how you see AI helping you ask increasingly sophisticated questions as your expertise grows.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I would like an easier way to interact with the AI instead of having to use my phone...my hands are usually occupied or covered in dirt or paint or something, so using the phone is a hassle.

AI: That's a really practical insight - the physical realities of working with your hands while trying to access AI guidance. That interface challenge could be a real barrier for wider adoption in trades work.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective as someone who's been pioneering AI use in repair work, from basic product questions to sophisticated technical decisions, gives us valuable insights into how these tools can evolve to better serve skilled trades. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
