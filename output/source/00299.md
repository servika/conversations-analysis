Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to help draft emails and proofread my messages. I also use it to double check my work. I engage a lot of different people as a consultant and I use it to make sure I am getting to the heart of the issue or problem and to make sure I truely understand what is needed.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI both for communication tasks and as a kind of thinking partner for your consulting work. 

Tell me more about how you use it to make sure you understand what's needed with your clients. What does that process look like?

User: There are a list of questions I ask clients to understand what they want and need. I put all my answers into AI and ask it to review the information I uncovered and let me know areas I need to dive into more details. I ask to take on a persona and give it rules for a business need validator

AI: That's a fascinating approach - essentially creating a structured validation process with AI taking on a specific role. 

When you have AI take on that business need validator persona, how do you set up those rules? What kinds of things do you tell it to focus on or look for?

User: I ask it to thoroughly analyze my scoping doc. Evaluate for clarity and completeness of the business problem and desired busiest impact. I ask for feedback. and ask it to create clarifying questions I could ask the client.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful way to strengthen your client discovery process. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your consulting work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I am new to my role. So at this point I rely on AI to help me a lot. That might change as I get more comfortable in my role.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as support while you're building your expertise in the role.

When you do use AI for your consulting work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it everything at once and let it handle things more independently?

User: I hold an intake call with the client and try to get as much information about their needs on that call. But I do often have to go back and get more detail or to clarify something.

AI: I think I may not have been clear with my question - let me rephrase it. 

When you're actually working with AI itself - like when you're having it analyze your scoping document or create those clarifying questions - do you typically have more of a back-and-forth conversation with the AI, or do you give it all the information upfront and let it work through the task on its own?

User: oh I see. Sometimes I go back and forth, but mostly get all the information upfront.

AI: Got it, thanks for clarifying that.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or has their approach shaped how you think about it?

User: Yes I gained best practices from my peers on how to use it. We have created common prompts and we share them with each other.

AI: That's really interesting that you've developed a shared library of prompts as a team. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Just yesterday I uploaded my scoping doc and it provided several addtional questions I could ask the client and gave me areas that I didnt think of.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience - discovering blind spots you hadn't considered.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially as you're still newer to your consulting role?

User: I dont think AI will take over my job, but It will help me be successful which will help my client be successful.

AI: That's a really positive perspective on AI as an enabler rather than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as you become more experienced in your consulting role?

User: I think the more I and my peers use it, the more we will learn from it, probably the less we will need it. because we will see what we are missing. But we might use it in other places of our work.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to think about it - AI helping you learn to see what you might be missing, which then builds your own capabilities over time.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a learning tool that helps you identify blind spots in your client discovery process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: It would be great if AI could do a better job of creating excel docs and reading those docs. We use them a lot and so far I have not had a lot of success with AI when using those.

AI: That's really valuable feedback - Excel functionality being a gap in your current AI workflow. It sounds like spreadsheet work is a significant part of your consulting process.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a validation partner, learning from shared team prompts, and how it's helping you develop expertise in your new role will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
