Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently I am in the process of learning Power Automate and AI has been helping me learn. I also use AI to help me make Excel macros. Its also useful to make emails sound more professional. I can go into detail if you want?

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across quite a range of different work activities. I'd love to hear you go into more detail about any of those examples that stand out to you.

User: So, each morning we receive a number of emails that all contain attachments. Each morning I have to drag and drop around 20+ attachments into their respective folders. Ive been learning, with the help of AI, how to make Power Automate flows to identify a new email and save the .pdfs into specific folders. It took a while to get it right and Im still not finished with all the ones I want.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of using AI to tackle a repetitive daily task. When you were working with AI to learn Power Automate for this email automation project, how did that process actually unfold? Were you bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI, or asking it to write complete solutions for you?

User: Well, Im not completely happy with working with the AI. It seems to be describing an older Power Automate version. It seems to tell me click or choose things that are not there, or they are named something different. Its a lot of back and forth correcting the AI.

AI: That sounds frustrating - having to constantly correct the AI when the interface has changed. Tell me more about how you handle those moments when the AI gives you outdated information. What's your process for working through those mismatches?

User: Sometimes I just start a fresh chat since it can go so far off the rails. Other times I tell it to just give me one step at a time. That sort of makes it easier to correct and get the AI back on track.

AI: That's a smart adaptation - starting fresh or breaking it down step by step. When you think about that whole experience with Power Automate, despite the frustrations with outdated information, what keeps you coming back to using AI for learning it rather than, say, just looking up tutorials or documentation on your own?

User: Its sort of the only resource I have. I can look up Youtube videos or Reddit threads but I tend to not find anything related to exactly what I am looking for. Despite the frustration and time sink it pays off when its complete.

AI: That makes sense - AI becomes your go-to when you need something specific that general resources don't cover. You mentioned Excel macros and professional emails as other ways you use AI at work. How does your experience with AI differ between those tasks compared to the Power Automate learning?

User: So I am just learning code and can do basic things, but when it comes writing I am lost. Luckily Excel has the "Record" function where I can just do my task and save it. Then when I want to do that task again I can run the macro. What I recently did was give my macro code to an AI and it cleaned it all up for me. It labeled sections and got rid of all the "scrolling" functions and made it much nicer. I also got it change the code where I dont want the pdfs to open every time I run it.

AI: That's a really clever approach - using Excel's record function to capture the basic logic, then having AI refine and optimize the code. When you handed over that recorded macro code to the AI for cleanup, how did that interaction feel different from your Power Automate experience? Was it more straightforward, or did you run into similar issues?

User: Not really different unfortunately. It took a while to get the AI to recognize the full code. I had to submit it in parts. Sometimes the AI would only give me a part of the code. It was a lot of reiterating I want the full code, not just parts. It got frustrating but eventually I got it to give me the full thing.

AI: So even with different types of tasks, you're finding similar patterns of having to manage the AI's responses and keep redirecting it. When you mentioned using AI to make emails sound more professional, does that tend to go more smoothly, or do you run into the same kinds of back-and-forth there too?

User: Yes, Rewording emails is simple enough. I also like that sometimes it will give me multiple to choose from.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Given what you've shared about these different experiences, are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to get a task as far as I can. This way I have the main part done and I can explain my end goal. This guides the AI rather than it guessing what I would want to see or have done. This can also help me get ideas on what I can improve.

AI: That approach of doing the groundwork first sounds like it gives you more control over the interaction. When you do use AI for work tasks, would you say you're mostly collaborating with it throughout the process - like you described with getting as far as you can first - or are there times when you delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Almost always collaborating when I am doing a work-related task.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk with others about how you're using these tools, or is it something you've mostly figured out on your own?

User: Yea, Our workplace has been pushing AI. We recently got new computers and updates. Now Copilot is on almost everything.

AI: So it sounds like your workplace is actively encouraging AI adoption with these new tools and updates. How has that workplace push toward AI affected your own usage patterns or comfort level with using these tools for different tasks?

User: Honestly, it has pushed it to the forefront of my mind a little. More and more people are using it and encouraging it.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When my fist Power Automate ran successfully. The flow was to take one email that contains 14 .pdfs and save them in 7 different folders. This alone saves me a few minutes each morning. Very satisfying.

AI: That must have been a great moment - seeing that flow work after all the back-and-forth corrections and persistence. On the flip side, can you think of a particularly frustrating moment you've had with AI at work?

User: Yes, I am having trouble getting the AI help me make a comparison Excel macro. We get a report from someone and then we run our report. The data should be the same across reports. The issue is that everything is in different formats like dates, expiration dates, and price. I havent been able to get it to build be a comparison but I have been able to at least help me with formulas to reformat everything. It keeps wanting to incorporate Python code but I want everything to be run with excel or macros. I kind of gave up on that.

AI: That sounds like a really frustrating dead end - the AI pushing Python solutions when you specifically need it to stay within Excel's constraints. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I dont think it could take over. There is a lot of problem solving and issues are constantly different.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - that the problem-solving aspect and the constantly changing nature of issues keeps you essential in the process. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I have been using it more. I will continue to use it as a resource.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your approach of getting as far as you can on a task before bringing AI in to guide the interaction - that seems like a really practical strategy you've developed.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical challenges of working with AI - like dealing with outdated information and having to break tasks into smaller steps - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through these different examples from your work. Have a great rest of your day!
