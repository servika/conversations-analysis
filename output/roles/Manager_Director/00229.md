Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to do research and ask it questions to help orient my own internal research, mostly. I might ask it for definitions or translations too.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a research companion. When you say you use it to help orient your internal research, can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice?

User: For example if I'm not sure about a process and it's difficult to find the information on the intranet, I might ask it about general procedures used in my industry which can help me answer questions from my clients or their shareholders. Sometimes this helps me find the procedure I'm looking for by orienting me to what I'm looking for.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a starting point to help you navigate toward the specific information you need. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: For now I'd rather write e-mails myself, and that's a lot of my daily work since I'm in client service. My outlook at work has an AI helper but I don't use it much. I find that a personal touch is needed and that the responses might be too robotic if I were to use AI to write them. My company hasn't implemented AI to so any of the repetitive work tasks and that would be useful to free up some time.

AI: That's really insightful - you're drawing a clear line between tasks where that personal touch matters versus more routine work that could benefit from automation.

When you do use AI for research and orientation, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask specific questions and then take that information to work independently?

User: More the second one, I might ask a follow-up question or two but usually it's just general information that I'm looking for and then I'll either ask a teammate if it's still not clear, or do internal research. I've also used it to help answer questions from other teammates.

AI: So you're using it more as a quick consultation tool rather than an ongoing collaborative partner. That's a helpful distinction.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned your company hasn't implemented AI for repetitive tasks yet - what's the overall attitude toward AI tools where you work?

User: I work in a very large company that combines technology and finance, so while I'm sure management is aware of AI and its potential, actually implementing it would certainly be a lot of work. There isn't a big push to bring it into our work aside from the addition of Outlook with AI recently. They tend to do most everything internally, develop their own software, and I don't think my company would want to implement tools built by other businesses for their core operations. And the investment needed to develop their own AI tools would be very big and I'm not sure that's something they're looking into for now.

AI: That gives me a good picture of the institutional context you're working in - a cautious, internally-focused approach to new technology adoption.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The only thing I can think of that would have been frustrating is when I hit the use limit on chatgpt and it requested payment, then I had to move to gemini which hasn't stopped working yet.

AI: That's a practical frustration - being cut off mid-workflow by usage limits. It sounds like you've had to adapt by switching between different AI tools to keep working.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm going to be moving to a new position in January, in a new industry. It's a very complex position in a high-stakes industry. When I passed my interview, I asked the question- did they foresee AI taking over the work anytime soon? The interviewer said that they didn't foresee that happening in my career, that maybe AI would be a useful tool someday but that there was too much human judgment required, such as unforeseen circumstances and nuance.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to approach a career transition - directly asking about AI's potential impact during the interview process. It sounds like you chose a role where human judgment and adaptability are highly valued.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving, both in your current role and as you transition to this new position?

User: I expect I'll continue to ask occasional questions as a starting point to research in my current position, and I'll be in heavy study for a year or so in my new one, and I may ask it to explain certain concepts in depth so that I understand them. In my new position when I will be working, I'm not sure they'll be using any AI tools yet, but it would be good if they used them to enhance situational awareness by providing data in real-time to assist since I'll have to be aware of many data points at once, as well as suggesting efficient sequences that I can review to ensure optimal work

AI: That's fascinating - you see a potential role for AI as an information aggregator and efficiency advisor, but with you maintaining the final decision-making authority. It sounds like you're thinking strategically about how AI could augment your capabilities without replacing your judgment.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your approach to AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you're thinking ahead about AI's role in your career transition and the distinction you make between tasks requiring personal touch versus those that could benefit from automation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that covers it.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research starting point, the importance of personal touch in client communications, and your thoughtful approach to career planning with AI in mind will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
