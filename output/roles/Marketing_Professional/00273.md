Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, please continue

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI for design tasks, such as drawing an image, or generating ideas for product packaging. This could include creating an drawing from a text prompt, or uploading an image and asking for edits to be made. I also sometimes use AI to help me draft emails to suppliers for my business.

AI: That's a helpful overview. When you're working on those design tasks - like creating drawings from text prompts or editing images - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you usually interact with the AI during those creative tasks?

User: Normally I already have a rough idea of what I want the drawing to look like, in terms of its contents, style, and colour scheme. I would create a text prompt that includes this information and see what the AI produces. Often, the AI's response won't be what I really wanted. In this case, I would either ask it to make certain edits, or if the response is very far from my objective, I would create a new prompt that words my request differently, perhaps by including more detail.

AI: That iterative process you described is really interesting. When the AI's initial response isn't what you wanted, how do you decide whether to ask for edits versus starting over with a completely new prompt? What signals to you that it's too far off to salvage?

User: If there is a single element that needs to be changed, then I would ask for an edit. For example, this could be the shape of an object in the image, or the colour of the bakground. However, in cases where multiple elements of the image need to be changed, then I would rather create a new prompt. I generally find that creating a new prompt gives me better results than asking for edits.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using the single versus multiple elements as your decision point. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain design tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: When creating the final design, I would still like to make the final refinements on my own. I find that AI is good at generating a general starting point for a design, but struggles to make smaller refinements exactly the way I want them. In other words, when I need more precision in design work, I find that I prefer doing it myself.

AI: That distinction between generating starting points versus precision work is really insightful. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it through a task. I don't find that AI has sufficient understanding of larger tasks for me to be able to delegate complete tasks to it yet.

AI: That makes sense given what you've shared about needing that back-and-forth refinement process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: Not too much. I tend to try out different ways of using AI on my own since my use cases are often different from other people. However, for my own particualr use cases, I often look for resources on the internet to help me better utilise AI's capabilities.

AI: So you're taking more of a self-directed approach to learning how to work with AI for your specific needs. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time I asked a model to generate a drawing of a product which I wanted to use in marketing materials, it surprised me with how good the drawing was. I felt that the drawing was better than what an artist could have created.

AI: That's a powerful moment - when the AI exceeded your expectations compared to traditional approaches. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it's definitely still useful to have skills in areas where AI might take over. At the moment it's not clear how good AI will get in the areas where I have professional knowledge, or how quickly it will get there, so it certainly makes sense to maintain skillsets even if at some point in the future, AI could take over.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to approach the uncertainty around AI's development.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will definitely make an effort to get more familiar with how AI can be used to boost my productivity. As AI improves further, I want to be ready to adapt to new functionalities and features that AI will offer to help with my work. This will involve experimenting with new prompts and delegating more tasks to AI, and learning to take advantage of it in new ways.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a starting point generator while keeping precision work for yourself - that seems like a really practical division of labor you've worked out.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all, thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative design process, the balance between AI generation and human precision, and your proactive approach to learning new AI capabilities will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
