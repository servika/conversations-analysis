Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a travel agent, and most of my clients come from word of mouth. Therefore, social media is a valuable asset to me. I have to come up with creative ways to get people's attention and create content. This isn't my strong suit, so I use AI to help me brainstorm social media ideas and write my posts/captions

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to strengthen an area that doesn't come naturally to you. 

When you're working with AI on your social media content, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you and the AI work together to create those posts?

User: The first step is gathering ideas. This isn't necessarily daily, but I use it to get a list of ideas that can help inspire my week or month of posts. Once I have that, I can use AI to help me write those caption as I create the posts. I usually describe the post or what I am trying to accomplish with the post, then ask it to help me write the caption, so we work together

AI: That's a really clear process - gathering ideas in batches and then collaborating on the actual writing as you go. 

I'm curious about that collaborative writing part. When you describe your post and ask for help with the caption, do you typically use what the AI gives you as-is, or do you find yourself editing and adjusting it? What does that back-and-forth look like?

User: Sometimes I have the bot rewrite it to make it sound more the way I want it or to tweak things. And sometimes I take what it has and tweak it slightly to sound more natural

AI: That makes sense - finding that balance between the AI's suggestions and your own voice. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work as a travel agent that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: AI would probably help me come up with ways to get more client leads, but I never really thought about that until now. It could probably help me write travel guides to send to my clients or next steps that share information. I haven't done that yet, largely because AI hallucinates sometimes and I'm worried I'd have to double/triple check the information

AI: That's a really insightful point about the hallucination concern, especially when it comes to travel information where accuracy is so critical for your clients.

Tell me more about that worry - have you experienced AI giving you inaccurate information before, or is it more of a general concern that keeps you from using it for those types of tasks?

User: More of a general concern. I have noticed that it tends to give outdated information sometimes. I'll ask it a question about Disney World recommendations, for example, and it will tell me about places or processes that haven't been around for quite a while

AI: That Disney World example really illustrates the challenge - outdated information could definitely impact your credibility with clients when you're giving travel advice.

When you use AI for your social media content, how do you think about that accuracy concern there? Do you approach those posts differently in terms of fact-checking, or does the risk feel different when it's social media versus direct client advice?

User: I still fact check them, but there usually is less to fact check since I provide a lot of the information up front to the AI

AI: That's a smart approach - giving the AI more of your own information upfront to reduce the risk. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently I was struggling with coming up with social media ideas, and I used AI to help me come up with some idea. It gave me a helpful list of inspiration that really helped me

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of breakthrough moment that makes AI feel really valuable.

What was it about that particular list that made it so helpful? Was it the variety of ideas, or did it spark something specific that you wouldn't have thought of on your own?

User: It helped me switch my approach and gave me fresh ideas

AI: That shift in approach sounds really valuable - getting unstuck from your usual thinking patterns.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned most of your clients come from word of mouth, I'm wondering if other travel agents you know are using AI differently, or if there are any conversations happening in your industry about it?

User: I haven't really talked to them about it, but I know they use it to help them write emails and such

AI: Interesting - so there's some awareness that it's being used for writing tasks, but it sounds like people aren't really discussing it openly yet.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially when it comes to content creation or other aspects of your work?

User: I hadn't really thought about it

AI: That's completely understandable - it's not something everyone actively thinks about.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or are you pretty comfortable with where it fits in your workflow right now?

User: I think I'll continue to use it more. I think I'll use it to help me write guides and format things - things that would take a long time to do myself

AI: That sounds like a natural progression - expanding into those more time-intensive tasks while being mindful of the accuracy concerns you mentioned earlier.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance using AI for efficiency while being careful about accuracy, especially the distinction between social media content and direct client advice.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're strategically using AI for creative tasks while being thoughtful about accuracy concerns will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
