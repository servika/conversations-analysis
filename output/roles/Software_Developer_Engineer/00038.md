Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions at this time.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The most recent project I worked on was developing a FEMAP API for combining the individual von Mises results of Static and Random Response Analysis performed on an FEA model.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating technical project. Can you walk me through what that development process actually looked like day-to-day? I'm curious about how you went from the initial idea of combining those analysis results to having a working API.

User: To begin with, I had to conduct research on the topic to figure out the appropriate way to combine the results. I found a few peer-reviewed journals, articles, and forum posts related to the topic. After determining what method would provide the most accurate results, I then picked a couple of different elements to perform the combination by using excel as a reference. From there, I read the FEMAP API guide, watched youtube videos, and found some free resources provided by FEMAP experts to figure out how to construct my code to extract the FEA results needed for the combination calculations. Once I got the code to produce the same results for the elements' data I combined in excel, the API was deemed ready for use.

AI: That's really helpful - I can see you had quite a thorough process there, from research through validation. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: For this particular project, I used AI to assist with creating the code for extracting the combined data to an Excel spreadsheet.

AI: Tell me more about that. How did you decide to use AI for that specific part - the code for extracting the combined data to Excel - versus handling it with your traditional approach?

User: I chose to output the data to excel, because I wanted a cleaner and more organized way to present the results. Choosing AI to help with this seemed like a great idea after I realized how labor intensive it was to read through the guides to figure out what commands to use.

AI: I see - so the labor intensity of reading through the guides was what pushed you toward AI. How did that experience actually work out for you? What was it like using AI to help with that Excel output code versus working through those guides yourself?

User: It definitely cut down on the time it would've taken me to develop the code if I did not use it. It created a skeleton that I just had to verify and modify, rather than building from scratch.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - getting a skeleton to verify and modify rather than building from scratch. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the journal research, the methodology selection, reading the FEMAP API guide, even the validation work - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I'm used to using traditional methods to solve these types of problems (e.g. reading books, searching the internet, watching videos). I had a lack of understanding and low level of trust for AI during the time. Additionally, the workplace had rules on the use of AI that I did not fully understand, which caused some additional hesitation. There has been a shift since, that allows more freedom to use such tools.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there were multiple layers influencing your decision: your comfort with traditional methods, trust level, and workplace policies. 

When you did use AI for that Excel code generation, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced? What was your process for making sure the skeleton it gave you was actually correct?

User: Before implementing it into to the master code, I tested it by giving it an input variable to output to excel and stepping line by line to see if it would create the spreadsheet and output that variable where I wanted. After a couple iterations using AI, I got exactly what I expected. From there I modified it further, so that it would work as intended in the master code.

AI: That's a very methodical verification approach - testing with input variables and stepping through line by line. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would be nice if I was able to input a CAD model and all of the requirements and specifications the part must meet into AI, then it determines what type of analysis to run (Static, Random, Thermal, Combined), runs the analysis, and provides a report of its results and pre/post-processing files of a desired type.

AI: That would be quite a comprehensive solution - essentially automating the entire analysis pipeline from CAD input to final report. What draws you to that particular capability? Is it the time savings, or are there other benefits you'd see from having AI handle that full workflow?

User: Time is my biggest driver. Of course I would expect there be a separate verification process the user would have to perform.

AI: That makes complete sense - time savings with built-in verification. 

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how trust and workplace policies influenced your AI adoption, and especially your methodical approach to verification, were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the evolution from hesitation due to workplace policies and trust concerns to finding practical applications like code generation really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering work. The way you described that verification process - testing with input variables and stepping through line by line - gives us valuable insight into how professionals actually validate AI-generated code in practice.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
