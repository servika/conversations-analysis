Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I might use AI to help generate spreadsheets and create visuals from data, and create formulas that I'm not familiar with myself. It's also helpful for writing - for example, turning a bunch of dot points into a presentation, a briefing note or an email. I've also used it to summarise long pieces of content.

AI: That's a really helpful overview. I'd love to hear more about one of those uses. Can you walk me through what it looks like when you use AI to turn dot points into a presentation or email? What does that process actually look like for you?

User: I'll usually take notes in a meeting in OneNote. They are brief and hit the high points of the meeting. If I want to confirm the meeting content back to the attendees after the meeting, and to include a list of action points, I'll get AI to create an email with a meeting summary and action list matched to the people responsible. I'll then edit to make sure nothing is missed, and send. It reduces the time needed to recap the meeting which is really helpful.

AI: That sounds like a really practical workflow. When you're editing that AI-generated email before sending it, what kinds of things do you typically find yourself changing or adding? What does the AI tend to miss or get wrong that you need to correct?

User: I may add in something that I have missed including in my notes, or some other information that should also be included for context. The AI generated email is usually pretty accurate with minimal if any edits to grammar or layout.
If there's a bunch of new content to be included, I'd provide that to AI and ask for it to be incorporated appropriately.

AI: That's interesting that the AI generally gets the grammar and layout right. It sounds like you've developed a pretty smooth back-and-forth process with it. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think I am in a period of transition between using traditional tools that I know well, and using AI to achieve the same output. I do enjoy creating a well-constructed spreadsheet, there's a level of satisfaction. Using AI feels a little like cheating - even though it's really a similar paradigm shift to when we moved from using slide rules to scientific calculators and then computers. No-one would think to use slide rules anymore, and I think the same will ultimately happen with using traditional tools like Excel - we'll end up getting good at writing AI prompts rather than getting good at using Excel. Though - there is a way to go before I can entirely trust AI to create accurate spreadshseets, based on recent experience.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective on the transition period you're experiencing. You mentioned there's still a way to go before you can entirely trust AI to create accurate spreadsheets based on recent experience. 

Can you tell me more about that? What happened that made you feel you couldn't fully trust the AI's spreadsheet work?

User: A good example is asking it to create a financial projection involving distribution of a certain portion of my pay towards paying off a car loan (including interest calculation and amortisation), contributing to a stock account and saving for a house deposit. I requested several scenarios to compare, so I could see the optimal use of my available funds. 
Once the car loan was paid off, the model did not automatically distribute the loan payment amount to the stock and savings accounts, and it didn't prompt for instructions re what to do with the leftover funds. I write pretty good prompts, and I would have expected that to have been picked up.

AI: That's a really specific and telling example. It sounds like the AI handled the mechanical calculations but missed what you'd consider the logical next step that a human financial planner might automatically think through.

When something like that happens - where the AI doesn't anticipate the next logical step - how does that affect your approach? Do you find yourself being more explicit in your prompts now, or does it make you more hesitant to rely on AI for certain types of complex tasks?

User: To be honest it is frustrating as I have to consider every small thing, every possible nuance, in order to get the right ouput. Yes I do rewrite the prompts, but now I know I have to check the outputs carefully to see if there are any missed interpretations.

AI: That frustration makes complete sense - having to anticipate every possible nuance defeats some of the efficiency gains you're hoping for.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends on the complexity of the task. I would be more inclined to collaborate for complicated things.

AI: Tell me more about what "collaborating for complicated things" looks like in practice. Can you walk me through an example of when you collaborated with AI on a complex task - what did that back-and-forth process actually involve?

User: When I think of 'collaborating' I am thinking of handling things in steps, for situations where I want to consider one output before refining/adding/rethinking. An example is a long piece of writing I had done on an involved subject matter. I asked for a particular output involving rewriting and improving the tone of the text, and then a re-readingprompted me to consider helpful additions and layout changes which AI provided suggestions for.

AI: That iterative approach sounds really thoughtful - using the AI's output to help you think through what might be missing or could be improved next. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people openly discussing and sharing their AI approaches, or is it more individual experimentation?

User: It is more individual right now - though it's an evolving space. I work in government and there's not so much experimentation, and we are required for privacy to use a government-approved AI model.

AI: That's an interesting constraint - having to use a government-approved AI model for privacy reasons. How does working within that requirement affect your experience? Is there a noticeable difference between the government-approved model and other AI tools you might use personally?

User: The approved model is pretty good actually. I can't say I've noticed differrence between, say, using it and ChatGPT.

AI: That's good to hear that the approved model works well for you. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't really call any extremes of reaction to mind, sorry.

AI: No worries at all - that's actually useful information too, that your experiences have been fairly even-keeled.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it's important. You can't evaluate the difference between good or best if you don't already have the  background knowledge to know the difference. For example, in the situation I mentioned previously about the financial forecasting spreadsheet, if I had not understood enough about finances to see there was a discrepancy (and at first, I didn't), I would not have investigated and realised the model's oversight.

AI: That's a really insightful point about needing background knowledge to evaluate AI outputs properly. It sounds like you see maintaining your skills as essential for quality control, not just for doing the work itself.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally?

User: I think that's a good point - my role may move to ideation, editing and evaluating, not necessarily doing the creating. It's hard to say where it will end up, at the moment I don't know what I don't know, and new possibilities are being raised all the time.

AI: That shift toward ideation, editing, and evaluation makes a lot of sense given what you've described about your current workflow.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on needing background knowledge to properly evaluate AI outputs - that's such an important point about the human role in this partnership.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, all good.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the transition period you're experiencing, the importance of maintaining domain expertise for quality control, and that iterative collaboration approach will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
