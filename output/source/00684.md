Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I currently have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I often use AI for helping me find the correct degrees to shave away when grading slopes/inclines. I input the information from grade stakes, one at the top of the slope and the bottom. I then include the approximate distance between the two and get AI to assist me in finding the correct degree of the slope. If paperwork requires, I will find the slope percentage as well.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're working in construction or civil engineering. 

Tell me more about how you actually interact with the AI when you're working with those grade stakes. Do you input all the measurements at once, or is it more of a back-and-forth process as you're figuring out the slope calculations?

User: Yes, I operate heavy equipment. Often it comes down to a back and fourth. I have received some wild numbers when inputting all information at once.

AI: That's really interesting that you get more reliable results with the back-and-forth approach. 

Can you walk me through what a typical back-and-forth looks like? What do you usually start with, and how does the conversation develop from there?

User: I ask, what degree do I need to get this slope to proper grade? The height for the bottom says it needs to come down roughly 4 inches. The grade stake at the top says the ground needs to be raised 7 inches from its original height of 40 feet from the base height. The distance between the two is roughly 240 feet. Of course this is an example, and often the numbers are much more specific. I used to be a welder, so I find using degrees is much easier than percentages which is what most operators use.

AI: That makes perfect sense - having that welding background would definitely make degrees more intuitive than percentages.

When you get the AI's initial response to that kind of question, what typically happens next? Do you usually need to clarify something, or ask it to double-check the calculation in a different way?

User: I have received some responses that are less than optimal, and taking a look with a specific slope in mind (e.g. 45 degree slope when it should be around 15-20 degrees) makes it easy to tell a response is incorrect. More often than not, the models are correct or close enough. The nice thing about this work is there is significant wiggle room for error. That said, I still take pride in getting as close to perfect as possible.

AI: I can hear that pride in your work coming through. It sounds like your experience gives you a good sense of what reasonable answers should look like.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the slope calculations you're comfortable delegating?

User: Any finish work or highly technical work I do without consulting AI. That type of work requires a very keen eye. I often use AI for locating specific parts on new equipment I run if I have never ran that make/model, but once I know where those parts/pieces are, I never tend to use it for those tasks again. Specifically the daily equipment inspection.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - it sounds like there's a learning curve aspect to some of your AI use, where once you've mastered something yourself, you don't need that assistance anymore.

When you say "finish work or highly technical work" requires a keen eye, can you give me an example of what that looks like? What is it about those tasks that makes you feel they need to stay in your hands?

User: Running cranes, or machines with grapple attachments, or slings to move those giant lego blocks, other pieces of equipment, or anything really. It is more important to have another person there as a guide/safety watch. AI could take that role eventually, but when other peoples lives are involved, it is important to stay hyperfocused.

AI: That makes complete sense - when safety is on the line, especially other people's safety, that human judgment and focus becomes critical.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? You mentioned the back-and-forth for slope calculations and looking up parts on new equipment - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task like that, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and expect a complete answer?

User: slopes often change as the distance goes on. When doing sub-base for roads, or pathways, or even drainage to ensure the roads don't flood, I often collaborate a lot with AI. The landscape is always changing, and I'd rather have a second opinion rather than go in cowboy style and hope for the best. As for the parts, that's usually a one and done type of conversation.

AI: That collaboration aspect with the changing landscape sounds really valuable - having that second opinion as conditions shift throughout the day.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other operators use it similarly, or are you finding your own path with it?

User: I haven't found another person company wide who used it before me. Now some of the young bucks I've trained have begun using it as I've mentioned how useful of a resource it has been in certain scenarios. The old fellas refuse to adapt and grow with the technological advancements. Stuck in their old ways.

AI: It sounds like you've become something of a pioneer in your workplace. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When you finish a job in half the quoted time, it feels pretty good. The company I'm with gives out bonuses for that kind of thing. Assuming the work is done correctly, without them having to go back and repair mistakes that were overlooked due to rushing. I can say for sure that I would have been second guessing myself much more frequently without the assist from the AI model, which would have lead to me completing the project closer to the quoted date.

AI: That's a great example of how AI assistance can boost both confidence and performance - finishing early while maintaining quality is impressive.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it feel less relevant given the nature of your work?

User: I for sure believe AI could take over my position. I don't think it will be anytime soon, but I think within my lifetime I'll witness it. There are already GPS systems in some equipment (dozers, loaders, excavators) that run the equipment with very little human intervention needed. It's only a matter of time before an AI model is able to do what that human does.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on where the technology is heading, especially with those GPS systems already doing some of the work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology advances, or as you get more experienced with it?

User: I am always trying to find different ways to utilize it at work. It makes you look exceedingly competent when you don't have to ask the boss how to do something, or where something is located. I am hopeful that I will be able to upload an image, and have the model be able to focus on very specific things in the image.

AI: That image capability would definitely open up some interesting possibilities for your work - being able to point out specific details or get input on what you're seeing in the field.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on becoming a pioneer in your workplace and how the back-and-forth collaboration helps you feel more confident tackling those changing conditions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't believe so.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for slope calculations, equipment familiarization, and how it's helped you finish projects ahead of schedule while maintaining quality have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear from someone who's not just using AI, but also introducing it to others in your field. Best of luck with your work, and I hope that image capability becomes available soon!
