Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a software developer, I don't use AI daily or in a typical work day, but probably once a week or every couple of weeks when I'm working on something particularly challenging or new, I will use AI to help. I often resort to AI when I'm troubleshooting or debugging and my own troubleshooting efforts aren't getting me far, I'll explain the context to AI and send my code and see if I can get any help. Also, when I'm working on new things that I don't typically work on I'll often ask AI for background information. For example, I recently worked on coverting some c# to a powershell script, I've never done anything like that and had no context so I sent the description of the assignment to AI and got a rundown on how I could get started. Finally, I find myself using AI to learn concepts I don't have a good grasp over, I find AI helps simplify these concepts and I can get to exactly what component of the concept is troubling me

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're quite selective about when you bring AI into your work - using it more as a specialized resource than an everyday tool.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you don't use it daily - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: my companies codebase consists of a lot of custom libraries and internal tunes we've built out, asking AI to help with new code or sending existing code and asking AI to modify it leads to a lot of questions from the AI about the random libraries and tools that are referenced, it feels impossible to explain all those little peculiarities and feels burdensome to start sending 30+ classes of libraries and helper classes to help write a few unit tests or modify a class with some quick code

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the overhead of explaining all those internal dependencies and custom libraries would definitely be cumbersome. It sounds like the context-setting becomes more work than just doing it yourself in many cases.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Definitely collaboration. I find myself explaining a lot to the AI what I'm trying to achieve and what is already there.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it involves quite a bit of back-and-forth communication with the AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues agree and echo my sentiment that using external chatbots to help with code is often more cumbersome than it's worth. Where we hope to incorporate AI into our work is with automated tools integrated into our work enviornment, we have been demoing a SQL review bot to conduct code reviews for SQL changes. We are also looking to eventually integrate atlassian AI tools on confluence and jira. We are also training up our salesforce engineers to eventually use salesforce AI tools

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - the contrast between using external chatbots versus integrated AI tools built into your existing workflow. It sounds like the integration aspect makes a big difference for your team.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think mostly with explaining design patterns and basic coding concepts that have troubled me since undergrad but that I never really dug into understanding. I am an experienced software engineer that studied computer science yet I struggled with, somewhat embarassingly, understanding the point of static vs. non static. In my undergrand education I really tried to understand but always had a somewhat fuzzy understanding. Being able to ask AI stupid, basic questions to really drill in the point helped me understand in a way I'd never have been comfortable to badger a professor to understand

AI: That's such a valuable insight - the ability to ask those "basic" questions without judgment sounds really powerful. It's interesting how AI can fill that gap where you might feel uncomfortable asking colleagues or professors to keep explaining fundamental concepts.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's a scary thought, right now I'm seeing the pain points in adopting AI in a widespread way into existing gigantic codebases, so that brings me a little comfort, but I imagine AI-Native companies in the industry will change the way employment works and what employers are looking for, which will ripple into the entire employment framework

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the industry-wide implications. The distinction you make between AI-native companies and existing ones with large codebases is particularly interesting.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will start with integrating AI tools that B2B companies like atlassian develop for their own suite, where they have a more specific understanding of their customers needs and can gear their tools to help more efficiently with.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the overhead of explaining custom internal systems makes external AI tools less practical, and how AI-native companies might reshape the entire employment landscape.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: The most glaring thing I've noticed in my own work and in my friends' work is that using AI tools is much more effective and helpful when the scope of what the AI tool can handle is more narrow. LLMs trained for the medical or legal field have been much more helpful to friends in those fields than any attempt at using generalized tools like chatGPT/Gemini/Claude. This isn't surprising, that is kind of the point of narrow LLMs but I feel like there is reluctance to adopt AI when the general publics interactions are with these very generalized LLMs prone to error. I do not have any incentive to purchase access to an LLM for coding specifically, but I imagine many of the complaints I have about using AI in my work would be resolved if I used a narrower and more specific LLM

AI: That's an incredibly insightful observation about the effectiveness of narrow versus generalized AI tools. The point about public perception being shaped by interactions with general LLMs, while the real value might lie in more specialized applications, is particularly valuable for our research.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical challenges of AI integration, the importance of workplace culture, and especially this distinction between narrow and broad AI applications will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
