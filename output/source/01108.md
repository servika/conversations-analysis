Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's get started

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work in production management for high end TV and film. This involves being across the entire filming process from start to finish, including hiring other creatives like camera people, costume designers, set designers, writers and editors.

AI: That sounds like a really complex role with so many moving pieces to coordinate. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: To be honest I find that AI tools are most useful for automating admin tasks, rather than as part of the creative process. They're not currently advanced enough to be really useful for script writing, on screen graphic design, or other key creative elements. They are very helpful for things like drafting memos or research into e.g. different eras of fashion for costume design, which frees up more time to focus on creative work.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found AI most valuable as a behind-the-scenes efficiency tool rather than a direct creative collaborator.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: On a recent film I worked on, we used AI to draft a formal warning letter to someone whose behaviour was not up to standard. There is no HR department on film or TV productions usually so those tasks fall to the production management team who are not necessarily HR experts, so it's helpful to use AI to draft something that has the right tone. We've also tried using it for things like generating graphics for internal comms like event invitations, but it didn't work too well for that - I haven't found an AI model that's capable of producing a document with both coherent text and strong images together yet.

AI: That's a really practical example - using AI to help with the HR side when you don't have that expertise in-house. And it sounds like you've tested the boundaries of what works and what doesn't, like with those internal graphics.

When you're working with AI on tasks like drafting that warning letter, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: A task like that isn't really creative, but I as the person using the tool to draft the letter would be in charge of the decisions on how it should be written, structured, etc. If I'm going to send something out with my name on it I need to be happy that everything is exactly how I want it. I think it would be the same for more truly creative tasks like graphic design as well, but it's harder to get the necessary level of control over AI produced images than it is for text.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - that sense of control and ownership over the final output being crucial, especially when your name is attached. And it sounds like you've found text to be more controllable than images in that regard.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: AI hasn't had that much of an impact on creative work for film and TV so far. I wouldn't say anything has hugely changed since we started using it, except that it helps save a bit of time and energy on some tasks.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like AI has been more of a subtle efficiency gain rather than a transformative force in your field so far.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I know people are concerned that it will take jobs away from freelancers eventually. Specifically the fields of editing and writing seem to be the most at risk. Personally I'm not sure an AI will ever be able to capture the same unique creative perspective that a human could have because it necessarily has to rely on data that already exists, which makes me think it would struggle to come up with something new. It also doesn't have lived human experience to draw on to create meaningful, emotionally impactful stories. That being said, it could be used to create lower quality "filler" content based on what the algorithms show is popular, which would still take jobs away from people since there is a lot of that type of streaming content being created these days. I think it will also create a higher barrier for entry for people who want to learn those trades since they'd have to develop their skills to the point that they can outcompete an AI before they can even get their first job, which may not be feasible for people from lower income backgrounds.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns, especially about the barrier to entry - that's something I hadn't considered before. The idea that newcomers would need to reach a higher skill threshold right from the start because they'd be competing with AI rather than learning alongside more experienced humans is quite significant.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it will definitely be used more for admin tasks, which will help save time and dedicate more energy to the creative work. I think it still has a long way to go before it's useful for generating visual content. I think it could have some really interesting applications in the realm of visual effects, since a lot of those are already computer generated. I imagine that if a human VFX designer could use AI tools to automate some parts of the process, it could save a lot of time and money in what is currently an expensive and time consuming process, allowing us to create more realistic looking and exciting visual effects quicker and for less money. I think this would be especially useful for modern digital production techniques like rendering vast, detailed background environments for use on LED volume stages. Tools like Cuebric are already being adopted for aligning real world performances with digitally created backgrounds, adding realism. This is the area that I think AI could be most useful in, as a new tool for skilled digital creatives to add to their arsenal, unlocking new creative opportunities.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - especially the idea of AI as a tool that could actually unlock new creative opportunities rather than just replacing existing work. The VFX and LED volume example is particularly compelling since those are already digital-heavy processes where AI could enhance rather than displace human creativity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might create new barriers to entry for newcomers in creative fields, and your vision of AI as a tool that could expand creative possibilities in areas like VFX rather than just automating existing tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it! I enjoyed getting to talk about this, thank you :)

AI: Thank you so much! I really enjoyed our conversation too. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in film and TV production were incredibly valuable - from the nuanced view of where AI helps versus where human creativity remains essential, to the broader industry implications you raised.

Your perspective on AI as a potential creative amplifier in areas like VFX, while being realistic about its current limitations, gives us a really grounded understanding of how these tools are actually being experienced by professionals in your field.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts!
