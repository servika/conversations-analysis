Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for quickly go through information that I myself do not need to go in detail. Typically with reports and compare them to our usual reports to highlight the differences and then I can analyse the differences myself. Use it sometimes to quickly write email replies that do not need to be personal. Sometimes use it for quick data analysis.

AI: That's helpful context. You mentioned using AI to highlight differences between reports compared to your usual ones. 

Can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically set that up with the AI?

User: I give the model examples of standard engineering reports we use which predominately follow a strict template that aligns with the engineering standards. Then I give it new generated reports that I need to review and ask it to find all the differences and how it deviates in content from the examples I have provided.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application. When the AI identifies those deviations for you, what happens next in your workflow? 

Do you find yourself going back to verify what it found, or do you generally trust its analysis of the differences?

User: I look at the differences and see if the justifcation for a non standard report is valid. I generrally skim over but not as in detail as I would if I had not used the model. I generally trust what it has produced, I do ask it to be overly sensitive to changes but to disregard trivial changes like the company names.

AI: That's interesting - you've found a way to calibrate it to catch what matters while filtering out the noise. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anything that requires my engineering verification to review I have to handle myself. I like to use AI to give a rundown first through things to give me a starting point and to see if i missed anything.

AI: That makes sense - using it as a starting point rather than the final word on engineering matters. 

When you do use AI for tasks like the report comparisons or email replies, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and let it handle the work independently?

User: Emailing I will just give everything upfront and just make sure it makes sense. In regards to reports I will collaborate more and fine tune the requirements over multiple passthroughs.

AI: That's a clear distinction - sounds like you adjust your approach based on the complexity and stakes of the task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: Some of the older workers will not touch it, but generally most see the time save it using it. I would say a lot of people are putting more trust in it than I am.

AI: That's an interesting observation about the trust levels. You mentioned others putting more trust in it than you do.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm generally quite satisfied when it has saved me time by going through 40 page reports and finding the sections where I need to actually look through. It is frustrating when it has made unwanted changes to reports I am writing.

AI: That frustration with unwanted changes sounds like it could really disrupt your workflow. 

Can you tell me more about that - what kinds of unwanted changes does it typically make when you're writing reports?

User: I guess when I have asked it rewrite a certain paragraph and have given it a lot more for context, I have discovered they have made changes to sections I did not want.

AI: That sounds like a real challenge - when you're trying to improve one part but it changes other sections you wanted to keep intact.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is and is major reason I am embracing using AI to make me focus on the important stuff.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI to free you up for the higher-value work. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: Probably would like to use it to automate a lot of trivial stuff and just automatically pull information from relevant emails.

AI: That vision of automation for the trivial tasks makes a lot of sense given how you're already using it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a starting point while maintaining your engineering oversight, and how you're strategically embracing it to focus on the important work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No not really, thanks.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance trust and verification, especially in an engineering context, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

Have a great rest of your day!
