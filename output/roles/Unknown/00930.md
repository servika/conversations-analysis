Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me with brainstorming for ideas, expert advice for tricky situations, and helping me draft emails or phone call templates

AI: That's a nice range of uses. Can you tell me more about what brainstorming with AI looks like for you? What kinds of ideas are you typically trying to generate?

User: My job relates to supporting a disabled adult (with high functioning autism) as a mentor, with life administration, and advice. I will typically use AI to brainstorm ideas where, for example, the person is stuck/does not have a secure plan for next steps. Or sometimes to suggest potential activities or social/networking opportunities for the person.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work. When you're brainstorming these ideas and solutions with AI, how do you typically approach it? Do you work back and forth with the AI to develop ideas together, or do you more often ask for a list of suggestions and then take it from there?

User: I tend to outline the situation briefly and explain some details about the person I am supporting. Then I work back and forth with the AI model. Sometimes I will ask for a list of suggestions, if a suggestion is good I will end the conversation there but I may ask more questions if I feel I need more nuanced advice

AI: That back-and-forth approach sounds really thoughtful. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your support work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Some tasks involve particularly personal or sensitive information and I am mindful not to use AI for those tasks for privacy reasons. Also, sometimes I will draft eg a telephone call template myself because I know the person I am calling very well and I can anticipate better than an AI model how the conversation will go. Also, if it doesn't seem like the AI model is 'getting it' rather than wasting time revising a draft letter or email with additional prompts I will sometimes finalise the task myself

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those privacy considerations are really important in your line of work. I'm interested in that last point you made about when the AI isn't "getting it." Can you tell me more about what that looks like? How do you recognize when that's happening?

User: It may be that the AI model has missed some nuance of my particular situation (for example, I work in the UK so that is a particular legal and social context). And sometimes the draft emails don't adopt the right tone, or are phrased in a way that makes it too obvious that AI is involved.

AI: That's really insightful - the tone and the obviousness of AI involvement. When you say it's "too obvious that AI is involved," what are the telltale signs you notice? What gives it away?

User: For me I sometimes notice a lack of warmth, sometimes the product is particularly wordy and at other times it feels too terse. That tends to be an AI 'flag' for me. I have an english literature degree and a previous professional background in law so it's important to me for my correspondence to be worded in a very high quality manner

AI: That professional background clearly gives you a keen eye for quality writing. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you discuss AI usage openly, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: I feel like few of my colleagues make the most of AI in the workplace, so I am a bit of a trailblazer from that point of view. I have had to give reassurance to others that I am not putting sensitive or private information into the models. We discuss it sometimes but my use is still more of an individual choice at this stage.

AI: It sounds like you're pioneering AI use in your workplace while being very thoughtful about the boundaries. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I feel most satisfied with AI use in my job when I am able to use the models to create lots of short, relatively simple correspondence which otherwise might be time consuming. I have ADHD myself and sometimes I get 'tongue tied' when trying to phrase things. AI can help unblock that workflow for me which is great and means I have more time to spend on the more subtle, personal support tasks

AI: That's a really powerful example of how AI can complement your strengths and help with specific challenges. The way you describe it helping you get "untied" and freeing up time for the more nuanced work sounds really valuable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel like working as a mentor/support coach for a disabled person is something which relies heavily on a personal relationship between me and the individual I am supporting, so I don't see my role being replaced any time soon. Rather, I hope that AI will help disability practitioners to be able to support their clients more comprehensively, and offer an alternative perspective for tricky situations. So I think it will make us better at our jobs, not take the roles away.

AI: That perspective on AI as a tool to enhance rather than replace the human relationship at the core of your work is really thoughtful. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as you get more comfortable with it?

User: Yes, I think as then models evolve I will become more comfortable with relying on AI for more complex or fact-specific tasks. It would also be great to be able to rely on AI drafting more and more as the models' phrasing becomes more sophisticated. I would be interested in peer training opportunities to hear from other disability practitioners how they make the most of AI at work.

AI: Those are all really valuable insights about your evolving relationship with AI, especially the interest in learning from peers in your field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your experience?

User: I think I would just like to emphasise again the difference it makes for me as someone with ADHD to have a model that can produce rough first drafts for me. That helps me so much as it avoids the 'blank page' panic on starting a task that can sometimes hold me back. AI is great!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing that - that's such an important insight about how AI can support different working styles and help overcome specific barriers like that blank page feeling.

You've shared some really thoughtful perspectives about your experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found that balance between using AI as a powerful tool while maintaining the personal, human-centered aspects that are so crucial to your role supporting others.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from privacy considerations to the way AI helps with ADHD-related challenges will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! I really enjoyed our conversation and learned a lot from your thoughtful responses. Have a great rest of your day!
