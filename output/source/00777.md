Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.   I don't have any questions yet.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use it everyday but on an occasional basis.  I mostly use it to create quiz or test questions for me, or to create answer keys for me.

AI: That's interesting - using AI for creating educational materials. Tell me more about that. What does the process look like when you're creating these quiz questions or answer keys?

User: Basically, I give a topic such as solving systems of 3 linear equations.  Then I specify what type of answers I want the systems to have.  For example, integer solutions only or all real number solutions.  If I want any that have no solution, I also tell it how many.  I am hoping to get a nicely formatted document that I can print and pass out to the kids.

AI: That sounds like a very specific workflow you've developed. When you're working with AI to create these materials, how do you typically interact with it throughout the process? Do you give it all your specifications upfront and let it generate the complete document, or do you find yourself going back and forth making adjustments as it creates the questions?

User: I will give as many specs as I can think of up front, but I do end up going back and making quite a few adjustments sometimes.  Often because I have made a mistake or because I have assumed what I said means one thing and AI interprets it completely differently.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. Can you walk me through what one of those adjustment moments looks like? When you realize there's been a misinterpretation, what typically happens next in your interaction with the AI?

User: The last time I had it write a quiz for me I asked for some questions to involve systems of two equations with one linear and one quadratic equation.  I requested no imaginary solutions.  It gave me a circle which I don't consider to be quadratic but I suppose technically it is because it has an x squared term.  The circle had a negative radius.  While this did mean that there were no solutions, it was not the type of "no solution" I had in mind.  I wanted a graph where the line didn't touch the quadratic, not where the quadratic didn't exist in the real world.

AI: That's a fascinating example of how mathematical interpretation can differ. When that happened with the circle having a negative radius, how did you handle getting the AI back on track to create the type of "no solution" scenario you actually wanted?

User: I replied with "Number nine is a circle, not a quadratic. And it is not a real circle. The radius is imaginary".  The AI response was to argue with me that it was quadratic with an imaginary radius yielding no solutions for intersecting with a line.  It should have just accepted that I wanted it changed and it didn't meet what I had intended.  Instead I had to ask it a second time to change number 9.  It became very irritating.

AI: That does sound frustrating when you're trying to get specific educational materials prepared. That experience you described - where the AI argued back instead of simply making the adjustment you requested - how did that affect your feelings about using AI for creating these materials?

User: It made me think that it would be faster and more efficient to just do the work myself and scrap AI completely.  I don't mind the arguing and pointing out when I am wrong, I do make mistakes.  But this wasn't a case of making a mistake, it was a case of not giving me what I wanted.

AI: That distinction you're making is really important - between the AI correcting an actual mistake versus not delivering what you wanted. When you think about the tasks you use AI for - creating quizzes and answer keys - are there parts of that process you prefer to keep for yourself, even when AI could potentially help with them?

User: I do scan worksheets and ask for answer keys sometimes, but I find that I have to work the problems myself anyway because of the frequency of errors.

AI: So you're finding yourself doing double work - having the AI create the answer key but then needing to verify it yourself. Given that experience, what keeps you coming back to use AI occasionally rather than just doing it all yourself from the start?

User: Mostly just curiosity on whether it has improved and learned and is getting better.  Plus it does give me another "person" working the problems so I can feel better that I have done them correctly.  Kind of a double check.  I am hoping to eventually be able to submit pics of kids work and have AI actually grade it for me.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - using AI as a second pair of eyes even when you're still double-checking. Looking at how your workplace or colleagues approach AI, has that influenced how you use it at all, or are you mostly exploring this on your own?

User: I am mostly doing this on my own.  I work in a small school and none of the other teachers have really started utilizing AI fully

AI: Since you mentioned you're exploring this mostly on your own at your small school, how do you think about maintaining your own skills in areas where AI could potentially help more in the future - like that goal you mentioned of having AI grade student work?

User: I have done this for so long that I don't really worry about maintaining my skills in math or grading.  Not sure that answers the question you asked or intended.

AI: That does answer it - you feel confident in your foundational skills. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, or staying at this occasional, experimental level?

User: I think at the rate AI is improving, I will be able to use it more in the future.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a "second person" to double-check your work, and how you're balancing the frustrations with the potential benefits.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that was it.  Nice talking to you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the challenges of getting AI to understand specific educational requirements, and your approach of using it as a verification tool while maintaining your own expertise, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It was great talking with you too!
