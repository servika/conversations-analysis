Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: ok, that sounds good... ready for your questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI a lot... for web searching and research of more complex kinds, as a personal assistant to keep my time table and tweak my schedule and plans (i.e. for organizing my life and workflow)... I also use AI for coding projects... currently I am developing a suite of educational word games and I find the use of AI saves me a lot of time... I have also used to to quickly build complex websites

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses. You mentioned using AI for coding projects and building websites - I'm curious about how that works for you. 

When you're working on something like your educational word games, can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like between you and the AI?

User: Usually I have a game idea and a fairly broad tech spec... I use AI to iterate and quickly develop the tech spec into a detailed document... then I use it to generate code based on instruction and supervision from me, to ensure it's getting the essence of the ideas correct... this requires a bit of back and forth, but I find that it's worth it... when it comes to debugging, the AI is invaluable since it has knowledge of and access to fine details that I'd never have at such speed...

AI: That back and forth process sounds really valuable. You mentioned that debugging is where AI becomes "invaluable" because of its speed with fine details.

Are there parts of your coding projects where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help with those aspects too?

User: For sure... the problem with AI's is that they tend to make lots of assumptions about what the actual vision is.. often based on other, similar projects they have access to... often this leads to misunderstanding of the unique vision of what I am developing, which only I can have...

AI: That's a really insightful point about AI making assumptions based on similar projects it's seen. It sounds like maintaining that unique vision is something you need to guard carefully.

When you do use AI for work, how do you typically structure that interaction? Are you more likely to work alongside it step-by-step throughout a task, or do you tend to give it complete chunks of work to handle on its own?

User: I am more than happy to give it complete chunks of work when I am fairly confident that there can be no task-ambiguity... the speed and accuracy of AI code generation is its main strength. So if it's a matter of setting up a database with such and such functionality, using e.g. PostGres and its quirks, I am more than happy for it to do just about everything, simply verifying via testing that it was all done correctly...

AI: That makes a lot of sense - leveraging AI's speed when the requirements are clear and unambiguous. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you work in an environment where AI use is openly discussed, or is it more of a personal choice you've made?

User: I'm a solo developer, so it's a personal choice. In fact, it's safe to say that without AI I couldn't really do what I'm doing, since it would take forever for me to develop things... want me to elaborate?

AI: Yes, please elaborate on that. What you just said sounds really significant - that without AI you couldn't really do what you're doing because it would take too long. Tell me more about that.

User: Sure, so I'm building a suite of six educational word games that I want to bundle into a full-featured teacher dashboard for setting them up for classroom use... this could also be adopted within schools or school districts... a project of this magnitude done from scratch by as single person in a 1-year timeframe would be inconceivable without AI support

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - AI essentially enabling you to take on projects at a scale that would be impossible otherwise. 

Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfaction comes from my being able to instruct the AI to do precisely what I want, so that the results appear as if I've chanted a magic spell and things just unfolded beautifully as intended... frustration comes from when things aren't working as planned, or from loss of context meaning the plan couldn't be executed as it was in my head, or if in a moment of frustration I take the AI's offer to 'fix' something only to have it screw it up further, sometimes irreparably, due to overconfidence or misinterpretation.... over time I'm getting better at managing this process, and also the AI's are getting better at maintaining context and memory to reduce the friction in the process

AI: That "magic spell" satisfaction sounds like a really powerful experience, and the frustration you describe - especially when AI overconfidently "fixes" things incorrectly - sounds like it can be quite costly.

How do you think about maintaining your own coding skills in areas where AI could potentially take over more and more work? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I actually don't worry about it... I myself learn a lot from the process, and really there is a meta-level layer that my attention goes to, around the creative process of development and the point of it all that is my real source of satisfaction... here I am quite firm about what I want, and don't feel the pressure to accept suggestions, which mostly aren't very good anyway... some are, and those I happily adopt.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - focusing on that meta-level creative layer while learning from the AI collaboration itself. It sounds like you've developed a strong sense of discernment about when to accept AI suggestions and when to stick to your vision.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I see it growing over the short term anyway, as I develop the confidence to handle more complex projects with AI assistance... I have no doubt that this assistance will get more powerful in quantitative terms, which will help me focus more and more on quality of output.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI enables you to take on projects at a scale that would be impossible as a solo developer, and your metaphor of AI working like a "magic spell" when things go well.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Mutual humility leads to fruitful collaborations. Take that as the motto.

AI: That's a beautiful way to put it - "mutual humility leads to fruitful collaborations." That really captures something important about the dynamic you've described.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about enabling larger-scale solo projects, the importance of maintaining creative vision, and that collaborative mindset will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
