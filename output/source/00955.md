Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I think I have the general idea. Let's get started.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a teacher's aide for a local elementary school. I help the kids with basic math and reading skills. One of my favorite things to do with them is telling stories. I use AI models to help me with this. I provide the basic elements--character ideas, setting, focus, length, etc., and the model creates a story that I can tell. I've done this many times, always to good effect.

AI: That sounds like a wonderful way to engage with the kids. When you're working with AI to create these stories, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you decide what elements to give the AI, and what happens once you get the story back?

User: O.K. Here's an example of how I initiate one of these interactions:  Hello: I would like to tell a Halloween story to my first grade students. I would like to use forest animals as the characters--rabbits, deer, squirrels, owls, maybe even a skunk. I don't want this to be too scary, but I would like the story to have an element of danger, so I would like to include a nemesis or "bad guy" in the mix--perhaps a coyote, grizzly bear or even a buzzard, who initially intimidate the other animals. The story should focus on themes of cooperation, overcoming challenges, and acceptance of differences. The story should take no more than ten minutes to tell. Please give the characters unique names that the kids will remember.

AI: That's a really detailed prompt - I can see you've thought carefully about what elements work well for your first graders. 

Tell me more about what happens after you get that story back from the AI. Do you typically use it exactly as written, or do you find yourself making changes when you're actually telling it to the kids?

User: When I get the story back from model, I review it for overall tone and message. Typically, I will make a few changes, perhaps make the bad guy a wolf instead of a bobcat, or I will change some of the names. If I like the general theme of the story, I will focus upon how I will tell it. If I'm not happy with the story's direction, I will ask the model to revise it. I repeat this process until I feel like I have something I can use. I don't recall ever needing more than three turns with the model to get what I needed.

AI: That iterative approach sounds really effective. I'm curious about your decision-making process here - you mentioned that you make changes like switching from a bobcat to a wolf, or adjusting names. What drives those kinds of modifications? How do you decide what needs tweaking when you're reviewing the story?

User: I don't know that I follow any set guidelines when I make these adjustments. I like to be consistent with my students' frame of reference. For example, if they just visited the local zoo, I might emphasize animals they saw there, or maybe I overheard some of them talking about a raccoon in their neighborhood. I always enjoy portraying "bad guys" --wolves, mountain lions, bears, etc.--as misunderstood creatures who share many things in common with their "good guy" counterparts.

AI: That's really thoughtful - connecting to what the kids have recently experienced and showing them that "bad guys" might just be misunderstood. 

When you think about this storytelling process, are there parts of creating these stories that you prefer to keep for yourself rather than having the AI handle? What feels important for you to contribute directly?

User: I believe I do keep some aspects of the story for myself.  For example, I always try to make the story reflect something we are doing in class, some of the personalities of the students, etc. This is not something I would expect the models to do for me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're bringing that personal knowledge of your specific students and classroom context that only you would have.

When you're actually in the moment of telling the story to the kids, how much are you sticking to what the AI created versus improvising or adapting based on how the children are responding in real time?

User: When I tell the stories, I always try to gauge the level of engagement with the students. Before I tell any story, I identify options for change. For example, if I get the impression that the students think the story is a bit too tame, I might add a bit more action for the "bad guy"--perhaps have him threaten one of the good guys or steal something of theirs. That's the great thing about telling a story versus simply reading one. I can make adjustments in real time.

AI: That real-time adaptability sounds like such a valuable skill. You're essentially collaborating with both the AI and your students to create something that works in the moment.

I'm curious about your colleagues or your school environment - how has your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI for this kind of storytelling? Do other staff members know you're using it, and if so, what's their reaction?

User: Honestly, I have only discussed AI for storytelling in general terms with the teachers I assist. They use the models to help them with lesson plans and to create practice math problems, but story-telling is pretty much my unique domain.

AI: So you've found your own niche with the storytelling while they're using AI for more traditional lesson planning tasks.

Can you share a time when using AI for your storytelling made you feel particularly satisfied or maybe frustrated? What was happening in that specific situation?

User: Sure, I can share examples of both. On the positive side, one of my first Halloween stories, this one about a group of forest animals who wanted to have a party and wondered whether to invite the wolf who was so mean to them. The kids really got into the story. They loved the characters' names and talked about the story after I finished, asking me questions about what happened afterward. On the frustrating side, and this is more my fault than the model's, as I began to tell a Christmas story about a poor boy who wanted to give his mother a wonderful present, the students immediately began asking questions about what kind of present and then saying what they wanted for Christmas and what the boy should give his mother as a present.  The discussion was fun, but the story went off the rails. I can't blame the model for that, though.

AI: Those are great examples - it sounds like that Halloween story really hit the mark with the kids getting so engaged they wanted to know

User: Did you have any other questions?

AI: Yes, I do have a couple more questions that would be really helpful.

How do you think about maintaining your storytelling skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As much as I like using the models to help me generate the stories I tell, I'm not ready to let them "take over" as you characterized it. I believe very strongly that, at its heart, story-telling is about human-to-human connections. While I have no doubt that a model can create and tell a story, it cannot, however, read the audience or make that human connection. The kids already get plenty of screen time. They crave human interaction. That is what storytelling is all about.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the human connection and ability to read the room being irreplaceable elements.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as time goes on?

User: I do not envision making significant changes to the way I utilize the models for storytelling, but my role as a teacher's aide is always changing. I have not used it yet for math and this seems like an area where the models could be very helpful.

AI: That makes sense - keeping the storytelling approach steady while exploring new areas like math assistance.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on storytelling being fundamentally about human connection, even when AI helps with the content creation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
