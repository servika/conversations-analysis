Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically have 2 use cases for AI at work. The first is to simplify the wording of specific business documents and consult AI until I understand it. The second is to me understand complicated codebases and help write specific code.

AI: That's helpful context. Tell me more about that first use case - when you're working with business documents, what does that process look like for you?

User: I typically provide the model with the whole document or specific snippets - I then proceed to ask it questions about what I have given it. I keep going until I fully understand the document  and the nuances behind i

AI: What draws you to use AI for understanding these business documents rather than, say, asking a colleague or looking up information in other ways?

User: It saves a lot of time rather than consulting a colleague or searching the web for the specific business terms. I also work in a very niche field and I would have to spend a long time searching for the information individually on the web.

AI: That makes sense. Now I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When it comes to "writing" tasks I prefer to do them myself. This is purely because I want my writing skills to always be sharp. Specifically when writing documentation for a project I am working on.

AI: What is it about maintaining those writing skills that feels important to you? What goes through your mind when you make that choice to write documentation yourself?

User: Maintaining writing skills is important for a person so they can remain literate and also so I am not completely outsourcing my thinking skills to LLMs. In my mind, I say that my thinking and writing skills are like a muscle and if I don't use it then it will shrink so I motivate myself to write it myself.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends on how much time I have, for example I wanted to convert a codebase from javascript to typescript. I delegated the whole task to AI and let it handle it independently. However, I provided it with all the API responses and bodies to assist it. When it is a more complicated task, I will specifically sit there and read every single line of code that the model has changed and if I don't like anything I will make collaborate with it until it satisfies the task at hand.

AI: Can you walk me through what happened during that TypeScript conversion? How did that delegation approach work out for you?

User: I handed the whole codebase to an LLM (claude code on my command line) and it proceeded to create types and convert the js to typescript. I also gave it the context and the API responses and bodies. I also gave it permission to edit the code without asking me everytime.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace is very encouraging of using AI, because we work in a niche field - we need all the help we can get. My colleagues sometimes feel like it makes the programming work very easy but the higher ups are definitely happy about that.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt satisfied when I was able to study for a certification (that my workplace required me to complete) with AI helping me. I essentially gave an LLM all the study resources and we picked it apart until I understood it. It also gave me mock questions to prepare which was incredibly helpful.

AI: That sounds like a really effective approach. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see AI being involved in all of my workflows - eg. my word processors, my spreadsheets, my chat applications, my code editor and emails. It will definitely make life easier.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you deliberately choose to maintain your writing skills while strategically using AI for other tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. Have a great rest of your day!
