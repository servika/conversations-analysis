Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. I'm ready to start.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work involves designing and leading workshops for businesses in many subject areas. As part of this work, I develop presentations, ebooks, training content and many other types of deliverables. These products always involve images, sometimes video, and require the use of graphic design elements. Sometimes this graphic design makes use of company logos, colours, and other in-house design elements but more often I have free reign to ensure the products I create best suite the type of workshop I design and facilitate. If I am doing a specific workshop, such as a design sprint, I am quickly capturing the work of the workshop attendees and using this to create products that represent the steps taken at various points in the workshop. To do this, I have to create documentation rapidly that is professional, visually appealing and can be used as part of the final deliverables I submit to the contracting company. I know that the more creative and visually appealing my content is the better it is received (with a professional focus of course!). I am often engaged in change initiatives, such as workplace culture, and create extensive interactive training files meant to engage staff in responsive learning. This means I focus my work on interactive learning scenarios rather than the read/watch videos and answer multiple choice questions that are so ineffective!

AI: That sounds like incredibly dynamic work - you're essentially creating custom learning experiences on the fly while also producing all the visual and interactive content to support them. The rapid documentation during workshops while maintaining that professional, visually appealing quality must be quite a juggling act.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI in many different ways in my work. Sometimes if I feel "stuck" at the beginning of a project I will use an AI tool to brainstorm various approaches to a specific subject, moving from a general overall view to specific features, such as activities for workshop participants, content for digital files, suggested graphic features (colour, elements, layout), questions for company contacts, etc. I often use AI to create specific images I want to insert in my presentations and final deliverables. I use AI for video generation as well, although I often don't use these videos as they are not quite at the quality level I want. I find AI tools where I can generate non-realistic image based video (cartoon, line drawing, etc.) and off-screen narration most effective. I have successfully used AI augmented reality tools and that was lots of fun and very engaging for workshop participants. I also use AI to critique and edit my final documents, or to add design elements to almost finished products. I actually use AI tools a lot!

AI: It sounds like AI has become deeply integrated across your entire workflow - from initial brainstorming all the way through to final polishing. I'm particularly intrigued by your mention of the AR tools being engaging for participants.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: A recent project where I used AI involved creating immersive learning for a nation wide veterinary company. Each veterinary location was owner managed but made use of company software, followed common procedural steps with business operations (including training) and worked to meet the business objectives of headquarters. I was asked to create training files that could be used at any location to train the various staff members commonly hired (front desk staff, lab techs, vet techs, vets, etc.) To do this I used AI software through a company called Thinglink. Using this AI software allowed me to take static images and information and make them interactive, including opportunities to use augmented reality. I absolutely loved the creative options I had through using Thinglink's AI and software platform. It made everything so much easier to create and share.

AI: That Thinglink project sounds fascinating - transforming static training materials into interactive, AR-enhanced experiences for such a diverse set of roles. You mentioned you "absolutely loved" the creative options and that it made things "so much easier."

Tell me more about that - what specifically felt easier or more creative compared to how you might have approached this type of project before AI tools?

User: First of all, I didn't have to code anything which was excellent because I don't code at the level needed to produce interactive files. AI took care of that for me. It made the learning design process easier and quicker which kept me from getting bogged down in small details that were not central to the project (it kept me on track).  Another thing I liked was the help the AI tool gave with enduring content was accessible to many types of learners. In the past, I would need to access many different tools to create the content I was able to create using one AI driven tool. This saved me time which allowed me to focus more on producing engaging content rather than merging files and working with tools that don't always like to blend together.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI essentially removed technical barriers that were pulling your focus away from the core creative and pedagogical work. You went from juggling multiple incompatible tools to having one integrated solution that handled the coding complexity.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Right now, I would say that the back and forth with AI tools is a little stilted but this is getting better. Sometimes the "follow up" questions are repetitive or redundant and I find that frustrating. So I would say that I am driving the collaboration and creative decision making, but that seems reasonable given the current working relationship. I like taking an idea and expanding on it, often to the point where the final product is very different than the initial concept. I like my work and I want to decide what to keep and where to go next. I think you were right earlier - Ai definitely removes technical barriers (and I like tech!) that are frustrating/difficult and provides a way to enhance creativity so I am better able to meet my creative objectives. In the past, I had to "dumb down" many of the things I wanted to produce because either the tech wasn't readily available or I didn't have the knowledge to use it effectively.

AI: That's a powerful point about not having to "dumb down" your creative vision anymore. It sounds like AI is acting more like an advanced toolkit that finally matches your creative ambitions, rather than a creative partner per se.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Instead of using stock photos and videos, or having to use photo editing and video production software, I can now use AI tools that create what I want when I type in text or use something I already have - like a photo or presentation - to produce a unique image or video. That has really helped a lot. I save time and end up with better, more unique products for my clients.

AI: That shift from stock imagery to custom, unique visuals created on-demand is huge - especially for someone creating materials for so many different companies and contexts. It sounds like you're getting both efficiency gains and better creative outcomes.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Everyone (I think) has concerns about how AI affects their area of work, both now and in the future. I know that as AI becomes more effective in its use of information and precision in identifying what is needed, say for a presentation or training, people in my role will have less of a share in the workplace. I do struggle with the fact that even if I copyright my work, it is in digital format which means it will be used at some point by AI to complete a project I won't be paid for. It's impossible right now to keep track of how my work is used by others in effective ways, especially when final products are being purchased by companies, even if I register processes. It is definitely an area of concern and debate and comes down to discussions about ethics and AI. Right now, I see creative, unique process as still being human but also see the definite possibility of AI taking over my work.  As much of AI development is commercially driven with profit being most important, I worry that concepts of ethical design will be left behind. Not that every company developing AI is unconcerned with ethics of course.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the immediate issue of your work potentially being used to train AI systems that could eventually replace you, and the broader worry about commercial pressures potentially overriding ethical considerations in AI development.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think that AI's role in my creative work will continue to evolve rapidly. It is amazing the ways AI already makes tasks that were so difficult just a couple of years of ago (coding, image editing, video production, ideation) so easy now. Five years ago if you had told me I could produce training files with imbedded augmented reality easily, I definitely would be skeptical. Now, things have really changed. I predict I will continue to seek out AI tools that are multi-functional so I don't have to flip from one piece of software to another to create products that meet my design and content standards.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has enabled you to realize your full creative vision instead of having to "dumb down" ideas due to technical limitations, and your honest reflections about both the exciting possibilities and legitimate concerns around AI's rapid evolution in creative fields.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the shift from technical limitation to creative enablement, the evolution from stock resources to custom-generated content, and your balanced perspective on both the opportunities and challenges ahead will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the exciting possibilities and the real concerns you have about the future of your field. That kind of nuanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the full picture of how AI is reshaping creative work.

Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!
