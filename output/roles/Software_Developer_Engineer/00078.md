Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions at the moment. You can proceed.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive right in.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your current work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: A recent project I worked on was applying quantum models to financial markets. The project started as an investigation of the raw financial data to evaluate how we could best drive the model. Then we established different variants of the model and tested them using the data. Once we had something successful we tested it within other environments (financial markets) to ensure it was useful as a more general tool. Then we performed numerical analysis to demonstrate that it was competitive or more capable than alternative options. This process was ultimately then written up in a complete paper.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - quantum models applied to finance is such an interesting intersection. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm curious about any stage - whether it was in the initial data investigation, model development, testing, analysis, or even the writing phase.

User: I used AI tools for assistance in code writing during multiple stages, for general ideas and content when report writing, and also for suggesting key literature and recent relevant findings.

AI: That's really helpful to know you've used AI across several different stages. Let's dig into one of those areas a bit more. 

For the code writing assistance, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach. What went into that decision-making process?

User: I used AI tools primarily to speed up the coding process. My traditional approach would be to create an idea then work out how to implement it in code on my own. This process would often involve learning about new methods or libraries and could take some time. Using AI tools meant this learning process was significantly faster as it synthesised the relevant information and provided sample code for me to modify.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to accelerate that learning curve when working with new methods or libraries. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like maybe the core model development or the numerical analysis phases - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: The core model development was a very creative process. It involved handling new ideas and concepts in a very new field (quantum economics or econo-physics). This is something I simply wanted to do for myself as I believe idea generation is the area where I can most demonstrate my ability. While AI tools may have helped brainstorm I wanted to see what I could achieve on my own first. For numerical analysis we were primarily using industry standard methods so while AI may have assisted in coding there was no great need for assistance beyond this.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - keeping the creative, idea generation phase as your own domain where you can demonstrate your unique capabilities, while being more open to AI assistance in the more standardized implementation areas.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. Let me ask about verification - when you've used AI for code writing or literature suggestions, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: For coding I would quickly test the code to catch errors which would happen occasionally. For this project there was not a huge amount of code so manual verification was viable. Also, I would request that the model verify or regenerate its own responses which would catch errors as well. Essentially the scale of our project was such that manual verification was possible, or AI tools were used more as a guide instead of direct outputs of solutions.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using the manageable scale of your project to enable manual verification, and treating AI more as a guide than a direct solution provider.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I am satisfied with how AI has assisted me for my projects (or at least I am not fully sure what AI would be unable to help me with). I would however wish for better accuracy to reduce the time spent verifying. I am aware that better accuracy and increased scale will come with time.

AI: That's really interesting - you seem quite satisfied with AI's current breadth of assistance, but you're pointing to accuracy as the key area for improvement. That makes sense given the verification overhead you described.

We're nearly at the end of our conversation now. Those are all my main questions - your perspectives on keeping the creative core of your work while leveraging AI for implementation and learning acceleration were particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think I have covered the essential points from my own experience with AI.

AI: Perfect, thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about maintaining ownership over the creative, idea generation aspects of your work while strategically using AI to accelerate learning and implementation were really valuable. I found it particularly interesting how you've found that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving the parts of research where you want to demonstrate your unique abilities.

Your point about accuracy being the key barrier - rather than capability gaps - really helps us understand how scientists are thinking about AI integration. The fact that you're satisfied with AI's breadth of assistance but focused on reducing verification overhead gives us important perspective on where improvements would have the most impact.

Thank you again for taking the time to speak with me. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank you for pleasant interview.

AI: Thank you so much! I really enjoyed our conversation as well. Your thoughtful responses and clear examples from your quantum finance work were incredibly helpful. Take care!
