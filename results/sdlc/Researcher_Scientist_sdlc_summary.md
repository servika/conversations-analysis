## Representative Examples

### Example 1: Interview 01212

**SDLC Score**: 21

**Categories**: development, testing, maintenance, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "AI tools came in handy in particular when trying to test out various numerical methods, as well as generally identify the limitations of each method in the context of what we were working on. We were able to thus build much more robust solvers at a much faster pace than if us researchers had just tr..."

2. "It would be actually the ability to not "appease" the user, which I think is sometimes a hindrance when incorrect ideas are introduced into research. This is basically due to confirmation bias on the researcher's behalf. I would like to be able to at least have more explicit flags at least that woul..."

### Example 2: Interview 01213

**SDLC Score**: 17

**Categories**: design, development, testing, maintenance, versionControl

**Key Insights**:

1. "I decided to use AI once I had a working version of the game. That is, I could run the program and play a single round of the game (I did this several times as I didn't have a "play again?" option at the time) and the correct winner was displayed (along with the correct cards of the player and the d..."

2. "I used VSCode for the process, so when a potential bug was highlighted, I was able to test and examine it easily. I made use of a REPL (via terminal, rather than within VSCode) to test small snippets of code, and I also had a separate 'test.py' file open which I regularly used to copy and paste larg..."

### Example 3: Interview 00047

**SDLC Score**: 15

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Ok, one recent project I worked on was working with coral, preparing for spawning. The initial idea came mostly from my bosses, who gave framework of what they expected from my team of researchers. We ultimately wanted to set up a settlement structure that we could use in situ for coral spawning, us..."

2. "I used AI in a few parts: first, in the literature review, used AI (of different forms) to help identify papers of interest, summarize papers of interest, etc. Then definitely used AI to help with calculations / thinking through dimensions for our blueprint & how much material we needed to order of ..."

### Example 4: Interview 00065

**SDLC Score**: 15

**Categories**: design, development, testing, maintenance, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "One research project I worked on had an objective of creating a novel attack on commercial drones.  I cannot share too many details as I signed an NDA, but I can share the general process.  By the time I had joined the time, the vulnerability that we planned to exploit had already been identified.  ..."

2. "In cybersecurity, we classify security flaws as CWEs (Common Weakness Enumeration).  These are more or less common security flaws in hardware and software that have been identified and documented by the cybersecurity community.  While in the past, many hours were spent looking through code in an att..."

### Example 5: Interview 00516

**SDLC Score**: 14

**Categories**: development, testing, maintenance, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I'm a PhD researcher that also works as a software consultant for a third party company, they provide me with data, I write code, etc. My main use of AI in my typical workday is code completion or CoPilot in Visual Studio Code for debugging, brainstorming, etc."

2. "So, CoPilot has access to my entire workspace, when I'm having an issue I'll ask whats causing an error, why I might be seeing what I'm seeing. It ranges from something as simple as why the buttons on a GUI aren't the right style, to help on how to optimise a model during training"
