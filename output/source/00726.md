Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great. I have no questions to start.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm still fairly new, so I have been doing some cold calling to get loads, drivers, and contract leads. I use AI to research profitable industries and get some insight into the best avenues I can use to get more business. I also use it to help give me information on laws and regulations of certain states or types of insurance needed by the driver or broker. It's is like my expert logistics person that I can get info from.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a kind of logistics consultant. When you say you use it to research profitable industries, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you go about getting that information from AI?

User: Usually, I have an idea of an industry I want to research, so for instance, like transporting dairy products in reefer trucks. I know that reefer trucks make more money than some other types of trucks, so I will ask how I can get a contract and what businesses I can call for loads. I start by asking for a list of well-known businesses that ship dairy products daily and then go on to ask for lesser known ones. I ask for location, phone numbers, websites etc. Sometimes I ask for a pdf to print out.

AI: That's a detailed process - you're really using AI to build comprehensive prospect lists. When you ask AI for things like phone numbers and contact details for these businesses, how accurate does that information tend to be? Do you find yourself having to verify or update what it gives you?

User: I definitely have to verify. I've had a few out-of-date phone numbers or numbers that go to a part of the business that isn't directly related to what I'm looking for. I usually take the business names and google them to get more details about the company, and also try to find direct phone numbers or emails to shipping managers.

AI: So you're doing that verification step as part of your regular workflow. That's really practical. I'm curious - are there certain tasks in your prospecting and research work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The trucking industry relies a lot on personal relationships, so I try to use a personalized human approach whenever I'm calling or reaching out to a person. It would be helpful to use AI to give me scripts or pivot questions to get more information, but I've had the most success with just genuinely engaging with potential partners or customers.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're recognizing where that human touch really matters in building those relationships. When you do use AI in your work, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern with it? Are you more likely to go back and forth with AI throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete request and let it handle it independently?

User: Usually I start with a broad request like "give me a list of 20 companies in the midwest that ship dairy products daily." From there, I will start to be more specific and ask for revisions like "only list the companies that do not have their own fleet of trucks," "are you aware of any contracts that these companies have with large trucking companies," and "could you give me the main contact number, address, and shipping managers name if you can find it. So I go from broad to narrow based on the results I get from each of those questions.

AI: That's a really clear progression - starting broad and then narrowing down based on what you learn. It sounds like you're having an ongoing conversation with the AI to refine your results. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your company using it similarly, or are you kind of figuring this out on your own?

User: I'm kinda figuring it out on my own. I know that I need to know it's capabilities to maximize its effectiveness so I I've been trying to find different ways to incorporate it and see what it can do.

AI: So you're really pioneering this in your workplace - exploring what's possible on your own. That takes some initiative. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was able to get a contract with 11 loads a month from one of the prospects I found from using an AI-generated list so I was very satisfied with that! Usually, I don't get frustrated, but there have been times when the list that it has provided had a few businesses that were no longer in business, so the information was outdated.

AI: That's fantastic - getting an 11-load contract from an AI-generated lead must have felt really validating! And I can definitely see how outdated information would be frustrating when you're trying to make efficient use of your time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yea it is definitely a concern. I'm always trying to figure out things that human offer to the industry that can't be automated and really hone in on that aspect like the personalized human interactions. However, that is not something that I think will be necessary in the long run. I'm still trying to figure out what skills would be good to work on that AI can't "take over."

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to approach it - focusing on what's uniquely human while also staying realistic about how things might evolve. It sounds like you're actively thinking about this balance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you?

User: I'm going to keep learning it and using it to get leads. Whether it's in this field or not. Basically I want to use AI to tell me ways to approach skill-building for things that are essentially "AI-proof."

AI: That's a strategic approach - using AI itself to help you identify and develop skills that will remain valuable. You're essentially making AI your career advisor for navigating an AI-influenced future.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found that sweet spot between leveraging AI for research and lead generation while maintaining the human connection that's so crucial in the trucking industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're pioneering AI use in logistics prospecting - from building those detailed prospect lists to thinking strategically about future-proofing your skills - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your process with me today!
