Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good. No questions from me. Go ahead and begin.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a teacher, so I use AI for a variety of purposes. I use it to generate ideas for lessons, as well as generating full lesson plans and lesson resources. I also have been using AI to help revise and spice up my IPP reporting comments.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you across several different aspects of teaching. 

When you say you use it to "generate ideas" for lessons versus creating "full lesson plans," what determines when you go one route versus the other?

User: Great question Claude. Usually when I am just getting started with a specific unit, or a specific curricular outcome, I am just looking for ideas. Once I have the ideas, I'll typically ask for them to be expanded with full lesson plans.

AI: That makes sense - so you're using it as a starting point and then building from there. 

Tell me more about that process when you move from ideas to full lesson plans. What does that collaboration look like?

User: The AI model will typically generate a list of different ideas, like recently I had it come up with a list of outdoor ed. ideas. From there I pick one that I like, and I ask it to expand it into a full lesson plan.

AI: I see - so you're acting as the curator, selecting which ideas resonate with you before expanding them.

When you're making that selection from the list of ideas, what factors influence which one you pick? What makes one idea stand out to you over the others?

User: I'm basing it off of my class and the specific students that I have. I'm always thinking about what would be the most engaging to them. Then secondly I'm also thinking of what it would practically take to set up, and how much prep time it would take from me.

AI: That's really insightful - you're filtering the AI's suggestions through your deep knowledge of your specific students and practical constraints.

Are there certain types of teaching tasks that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I'm sure that AI could help with marking student work, and assigning feedback to students, but I strongly feel that should still come from a teacher

AI: That's a clear boundary you've drawn. What is it about marking and feedback that feels important for you to maintain direct control over?

User: If I need to have a direct conversation with either the student, parents, or the administration team about the students work, and the comments made on it, I want to have been the one to have done it first hand, so that I can be more insightful when clarifying things to any of the aforementioned parties. When getting ideas and lesson plans from AI, I'm still the one that is running the actual class, and have the first hand experience of teaching, so getting those ideas doesn't subtract from that.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - you want to maintain that direct connection to student assessment because it feeds into your broader relationships and conversations about each student.

When you are using AI for lesson planning and ideas, could you describe what that interaction typically looks like? Are you going back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to get what you need and then take it from there on your own?

User: I usually get what I need and then fill in the rest on my own. I take the ideas and lesson plans generated by the AI as the first step of the building block and then I build upon it with anything else I want to change and add. That way it's collaborative, and it's not just my ideas or the models ideas taking complete control. Sometimes as a teacher it's hard to work through the brain fog to come up with ideas, but the AI getting the ball rolling with the idea can help me to keep going.

AI: That's such a relatable description - the AI helping you break through that initial creative block. You mentioned "brain fog" - that sounds like something many teachers would recognize.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? What's the general atmosphere around AI tools where you teach?

User: My principal asked me to run a seminar recently on how to use different AI models in teaching. Not a lot of other teachers in my workplace have adopted it and the administration team knows that I work with it often, so they wanted me to give ideas and answer questions. There is a general push to start utilizing AI more in teaching in order to take some stress away from teachers.

AI: It sounds like you've become something of a pioneer in your school - that's quite a position to be in. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was very satisfied at the end of the last school year when I had to write IPP's and learning updates. I had brain fog kick in again trying to get through all the writing at the end of the year. I could feed the AI model my ideas and evidence of learning for the student, and it would help me word the report professionally. Very satisfying and helpful.

AI: That sounds like it really came through for you during a high-pressure time. The way you describe feeding it your ideas and evidence but having it help with the professional wording - that seems like another example of that collaborative approach you mentioned earlier.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think with keeping AI collaborative, and not letting it completely take over in the content of the lesson plans or the writing of reports I am keeping a human element and personality to my lessons and reports. I am keeping my skills sharp, while also not burning out

AI: That balance between leveraging AI's help and preserving your own teaching identity seems really important to you.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you as a teacher?

User: I would like to explore resource creation with AI more, perhaps having it generate interactive activities and worksheets based off of curricular outcomes and indicators

AI: That sounds like a natural next step given how you've been using it so far.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found ways to use AI as a collaborative partner while maintaining clear boundaries around the aspects of teaching that feel most important for you to handle directly.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between collaboration and maintaining your teaching identity, especially around student assessment and feedback, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've navigated becoming an AI pioneer in your school while staying true to what matters most in your teaching practice.
