Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Please continue.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for a variety of work-related tasks. I have two general tasks related to teaching English as a second language:
1) grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation-related tasks
2) conversational topics
For the first task, I can use AI to both design and check lesson plans. And also review homework assignments.
For the second task, I can use AI to both design and research conversational topics. And also suggest questions to ask. 
Each general task will also require more specific prompting as the need arises.

AI: That's really helpful context about your ESL teaching. It sounds like AI is supporting you across multiple aspects of lesson preparation and delivery.

When you mention using AI to "design and check" lesson plans versus "design and research" conversational topics, tell me more about that difference. What does your process look like when you're working with AI on these different types of tasks?

User: Sure. Designing a lesson plan starts with choosing an English language topic to focus on, and then building a series of exercises to strengthen that topic.
This may be through reading comprehension and grammar exercises, pronunciation practice, and even wordplay games. AI can help design and check these lesson plans.
As for conversation topics, sometimes I ask AI to suggest an interesting and engaging topic, and other times I chose one myself. With the help of AI, I can 
research facts about this topic, highlight specialized vocabulary, and decide what conversational questions should be asked.

AI: That's a clear picture of how you're using AI across different aspects of your teaching preparation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I often chose which grammar and vocabulary to highlight, and which conversational questions to ask myself, as I think I have a better idea of my students' weaknesses as well
as which topics they might respond to best. However, even if I design much of the general task myself, I can still use AI to assist with specifics.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you have that direct knowledge of your students that AI doesn't have access to.

When you do use AI to assist with those specifics, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It is mostly collaborative. I will always have specific points I wish to highlight, but I might need assistance with a fact, or a grammar check, or a suggestion for
a question to ask, or a word game to play. These are all done with my direct involvement to build a lesson.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds very hands-on. It's interesting how you're weaving AI assistance into your own expertise and judgment.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I generally work alone as a teacher, and often from home so my students are learning via video chat. Other ESL teachers have their own methodology, but I suspect
all of them are using AI to help build lesson plans. The client also has a say in both the selection of topics and the general teaching / learning experience.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - working independently but knowing your colleagues are likely using similar tools, plus having client input on the direction.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When the AI suggests good conversational topics, specific questions, or an interesting word game to play, and the student engages productively, this is always
satisfying. If I need some material specially formatted for presentation, this can get a bit frustrating if the AI fails in this regard. Generally, I give the 
AI fairly simply tasks which I know it can complete reasonably well, so I am rarely frustrated, unless by design.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a good sense of what to expect from AI and how to set it up for success.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well, this is a real concern, and I consider it often. To be honest, I don't have much hope that my job as a language tutor will be around for much longer.
AI will simply do a better job basically for free. I cannot compete with that, no matter how much I improve my teaching skills.

AI: That's a very candid response, and I can hear that this weighs on your mind. It sounds like you're thinking quite realistically about the trajectory of AI capabilities in language education.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving, given those concerns you just shared?

User: As AI itself evolves, I envision my relationship with AI as a working ESL teacher will dissolve! This just seems inevitable to me. 
Thus, I will need to find different work to do. Maybe I could consult with AI language teaching tools for a while, but at some point, that will go away also 
and the AI will function autonomously.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective on the long-term challenges you see for language tutoring and how you're thinking through those implications.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes. One thing I didn't mention is that understanding how AI tools fail is also a component to my teaching methodology. Humans often learn more from failures.
OTOH, when AI fails, sometimes it repeats the same mistakes over and over. Or it just doesn't comprehend the task properly to begin with. These failures are
sometimes used as instructive examples in my lessons. But one day these AI models will make very few basic mistakes, especially with language comprehension,
and then my job will be obsolete. But I can celebrate AI's achievement at this stage in any case. It is and will be remarkable!

AI: That's a fascinating insight - using AI's current limitations as teaching opportunities, and recognizing that those same limitations disappearing will fundamentally change your field. There's something quite thoughtful about both leveraging AI's current state while also celebrating its future potential, even knowing the implications for your work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective on both the practical day-to-day collaboration with AI and the bigger picture changes in your profession has been incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
