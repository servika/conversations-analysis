Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a multi-disciplinary creative. I come from a family of artists. I am a film maker by profession. My skills revolve around shooting and editing digital footage. I have worked on a range of projects from feature films, documentaries, music videos, ads and online content. Recently I have also completed professional programs in VFX and Technical Arts. 

A typical project depends on the type. If it is a film or video project, it involves logging and cataloguing footage first. Then I build a narrative based on the story. The creative element comes in cutting clips together into a coherent story. There is a distinct visual grammar that changes with each edit, and this evolves as the narrative is crafted. It is one of the more dynamic and challenging natures of film montage.

For 3D projects such as personal artwork and game development, I first gain an understanding of the brief and then I proceed with creating 3D models along with textures. The detail in these artworks depends on the use case. There will be a higher poly count for personal artwork, but a lower poly count with more optimization for game engines. It all starts with a 3D doodle, which I then slowly refine into the finished work.

As a creative my first priority is to get into the mindset of the brief and to develop a workflow that lets art evolve into the finished piece.

AI: That's fascinating - you have such a diverse range of creative skills across film, VFX, and 3D work. I can see how each medium would require its own distinct approach and workflow.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find myself constantly using AI. Many 3D art pieces are based on realistic measurements and there are certain terms that help define what I need to make or what I need to illustrate. For example, for a project creating a realistic camera lens, I used AI to obtain the measurements of a micro 4/3 mount. In another project, I needed the history of medieval times to understand their architecture and what was relevant during certain time periods.

I have also used AI for help in coding python tools within Maya. It is very helpful when I am stuck and need another perspective. Coming from a non-coding background, as an artist working with complex software, this is immensely helpful in automating certain tasks. It also helps to troubleshoot issues within creative software.

The most useful AI has been is in learning new techniques. I would simply ask how to do a certain task in a software, and it would detail the process saving me a lot of time.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become almost like having a research assistant and technical mentor available at any moment. You mentioned using it for everything from historical research to Python coding to learning new software techniques.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I am working on a sci-fi watch project. Another useful thing about AI is that it can help filling in gaps or weaknesses in a skill-set. I am not as good in setting up and composing or laying out a scene. With AI I was able to get some quick mock-ups and concepts of how I can place objects. While it is not perfect, this is what makes it more 'human,' where there is deliberation and re-iteration through the process.

AI: That's a really compelling way to think about it - using AI to fill in gaps in your skillset and the imperfection actually making the process feel more human through that back-and-forth iteration.

When you're working with AI on something like those scene compositions for your sci-fi watch project, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It is always me who is driving the creative process. At the end of the day, it's not about the final artwork, it's about growing through my craft and seeking enjoyment and fulfillment. There is a lot of information and data as to what goes into good composition, and while my technical skills with composition and layout need stronger development, my sensibility as an artist and what looks appealing will always be stronger.

AI is like the buddy on my shoulder, my R2D2. It's there when I need it, when I need to fill in those blanks, and it's sometimes reassuring to know it's there when exploring uncharted territory.

AI: I love that R2D2 analogy - that sense of having a reliable companion that's there when you need it but you're clearly the one piloting the ship.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I have started to learn faster, which is very important in a fast moving technology driven profession.

I have been able to distill large search pages of information into exactly what I need. No more pouring over websites for over an hour just to find the one workflow step that I need. This has saved me so much time.

A major relief is in scheduling, logistics and project management. I can focus on the creative work and leave all that boring stuff to AI. For example, I needed to re-write my resume to be more in line with recruitment platforms. What would have taken me hours, took AI a few minutes. This gave me so much time to work on my portfolio.

Another improvement is in iteration and establishing a sense of direction in my personal projects

AI: That's a great point about being able to focus more energy on the actual creative work rather than the administrative side. It sounds like AI has really streamlined the more tedious aspects of your workflow.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Yes there is concern with it completely taking over, but as a generalist I see it as a strong set of tools rather than an adversary. The one concern for me is for new artists coming in who do not understand what art is. AI is not a be all end all. It's not about how many kinds of software you know how to use or how fast you can do a repetitive task. It is never about the final artwork or the validation that something looks appealing. It is about that journey through art and developing a craft. And that takes time.

The main concern is actually with individuals who believe that AI can eradicate their need for human involvement in the creative fields, just to save money. This not only lets down creative professionals, but also diminishes the perception of what AI can do and how helpful it can be.

The landscape has surely changed, but I am excited as now I don't have to worry about my weaknesses holding me back. I can essentially do even more creative work now than I could ten years ago when I had first started.

AI: That's such a thoughtful perspective - distinguishing between AI as a powerful creative tool versus something that replaces the fundamental human journey of developing artistic craft and sensibility.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: It is going to immensely improve my skills and in turn bolster my confidence. Over the next few years I want to reach a comfort level where I have a set of AI tools that fill in for my weaknesses and then focus on what I'm good at and get those 10,000 hours in.

I see it more involved in the logistics of my job. I see more help with tool building. More basic code training and building a technique library. Taking over my admin work, mundane professional communication like drafting cover letters or emails.

Self motivation can be tough, especially as an artist. But I have learned to practically leverage AI to establish a challenge routine where it presents a task to make something, and then I have to make it. The most important within my creative workflow for these challenges would be concepting.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI to create creative challenges for yourself is such an innovative approach to self-motivation and skill development. It sounds like you've really thought through how to leverage AI strategically to support your artistic growth.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as an "R2D2" companion that fills gaps in your skillset while you maintain creative control, and your concern about new artists understanding that the journey of developing craft is what matters most, not just the final output.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just that AI should be developed in harmony with human creativity. This not only elevates us as a species, but also AI as a true system of the future.

AI: That's a beautiful way to put it - AI developed in harmony with human creativity rather than in competition with it. That perspective of mutual elevation really captures something important about the potential relationship between humans and AI in creative fields.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative companion while maintaining the primacy of artistic craft and growth will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating these tools into your work.
