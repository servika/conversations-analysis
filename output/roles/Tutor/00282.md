Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a private tutor and AI has helped me ideate as I built a brand identity and began marketing, as well as helps me create and design lesson materials. I'm a fan of gamified and customized lessons, so sometimes I'll ask for an AI's assistance in generating questions for a math board game, for instance, or to generate reading comprehension passages at a specific grade level, with specific vocab words, and about a specific topics. I don't rely on it to create entire lessons, though, as I usually have an idea of what and how I want to teach and then I use AI to speed up the brainstorming or writing process.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves as more of a creative partner in your lesson planning process. 

Tell me more about that distinction you made between using AI to speed up brainstorming versus creating entire lessons. What makes you want to retain control over the overall lesson structure and approach?

User: Cool question. I know my students in and out; I'm the human in the lesson with them, witnessing their struggles and accomplishments. There's no way for AI to know the details about my students, like their interests and specific quirks, that help make a truly tailored lesson unless I explicitly tell it that information. And even then, AI can't replicate the relationship I have with my students, so if I let it take over lesson planning entirely, the quality of the education just won't be as high. Also, I'm very artistic and creative myself, so I enjoy creating materials!

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're describing that human relationship and intimate knowledge of your students as something uniquely valuable that you bring to the teaching process.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones where you do lean on AI assistance?

User: Yes. When I make board games and uniquely designed lessons (like with lots of graphics, colors, stickers, etc.), it's fun for me and engaging for the students. AI is bad at matching my instructions when I ask for complex graphics, and most models make you pay after a certain number of image generations. AI is pretty inconsistent with HTML too, so it can't replicate a homemade game/lesson/craft.

AI: That's a great point about the creative, hands-on elements being both personally enjoyable for you and more engaging for students.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will have an idea of what I need help thinking of or generating, and then I'll prompt that to the model. Based on what the model gives me, I'll either tell it feedback in order to get the output to where I want it, or if it was really bad, I'll just rewrite the prompt (but that's not too common). The models almost never give me exactly what I want on the first try, so no, I do not delegate tasks for it to handle independently. I use it to cut down the brainstorming or writing time, but I always have to make edits to anything it gives me before it's actually right for my students. For instance, I recently asked ChatGPT to help me write word problems for a student, and it took like 5 prompts to get anywhere close to what I wanted, and I still changed problems up as I copied them into my lesson.

AI: That iterative back-and-forth process you're describing sounds quite involved - it's definitely more collaborative than just handing off a task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're a private tutor, I'm curious if that means interactions with other tutors, parents, or anyone else in your professional network.

User: Well I mostly interact with my students and their parents, I don't have colleagues because I'm self employed. I don't notice it impacting my parent communication, but I have incorporated discussion of AI in my lessons for sure. Especially with my older students, it's changed how I teach researching and critical thinking skills.

AI: That's fascinating that you're incorporating AI discussions directly into your teaching. 

Tell me more about how it's changed your approach to teaching research and critical thinking skills with your older students. What does that look like in practice?

User: Well when I was having a student write an essay on a topic of their choice, Egyptian gods and goddesses, I had to explain to them that nowadays the first thing they're going to see on a search results page is an AI summary; AI summaries are not written by real people or experts, so they can and often are, wrong. I teach students that it's important to fact check the information they see in this summary, and to double check for corroborating information about anything they see online because a lot of content online is made with AI without us knowing. I also emphasize writing skills with my students because I fear this is what AI will take from them ultimately.

AI: It sounds like AI has really shifted how you approach information literacy with your students - teaching them to be more skeptical and verify sources in this new landscape.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI made me frustrated recently, but to be fair, I asked a rather complex thing of it. My goal was to create a worksheet that had multiplication problems corresponding to letters. At the top of the page, there would be a riddle, and at the bottom of the page, blanks to fill in. Each blank has a number underneath, a number which is the answer to one of the multiplication problems on the page. As the students solve the multiplication problems, they find the matching value in the blanks at the bottom of the page and write the letter that corresponds to that question. When they're done solving, they will have ultimately spelled out the answer to the riddle. I asked the model to present this in an HTML file and gave it a color scheme, too. I gave it free rein to generate the riddle and answer. The model gave me HTML files that were missing crucial elements of the imagined worksheet, like not putting corresponding letters with each multiplication question, or not putting numbers underneath the blanks at the bottom of the page, or, in one case, not even writing a riddle at all. It did not match my color scheme and included random graphics, on top of that. I am, however, usually very satisfied when I ask it to write reading passages for me at a certain grade level. It's pretty good at adjusting the complexity of the vocabulary and sentences appropriately. Sometimes it's not perfect at writing challenging reading comprehension questions or writing questions, but I think that has more to do with what I mentioned earlier, that it doesn't know my students or their abilities that well.

AI: That multiplication riddle worksheet example really illustrates the complexity of what you were asking for - so many interconnected elements that all had to work together perfectly. It sounds like AI struggles when tasks have that level of structural complexity versus more straightforward content generation like the reading passages.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am concerned with AI affecting my students' ability to read, write, and analyze information more than I am concerned with it taking over my job. Truth be told, with the way that the education system is being attacked under the current administration in the US and the nose diving literacy rates, I think that private education is on the rise. Homeschooling is more and more popular. The human element that I bring to teaching–observing students across sessions, talking with their parents, seeing how their parents interact with them, seeing their homes, building relationships and inside jokes–is what makes it impactful. These skills are honed every time I work with a student. I think AI may potentially make marketing harder, because social media is pretty inundated with AI content right now, so it may be harder to reach new people who are already burnt out from so much random content on their feeds.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - focusing more on how AI might affect your students' core abilities rather than your own job security, and recognizing that the relational aspects of your work are uniquely human.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think if AI can get better at matching complex structuring and logic constraints, I can use it to create more digital products/worksheets, which I would ultimately like to ramp up as part of my business model is selling custom learning materials. I would use AI more frequently and also delegate to it more rather than doing such an involved creative process if it were better at those complicated tasks. I recently found a huge archive of online learning resources through my local public library, and it's important to me to use library resources so they continue to get funding, so I picture I may use AI less for basic stuff like reading passages or math questions/assessments, since I now have a more preferred way to find those.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the relational aspects of teaching - knowing your students inside and out, building those connections - remain uniquely human, and how you're thinking about AI's impact on your students' core learning skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
