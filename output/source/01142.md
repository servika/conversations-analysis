Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. Have at it!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work as a freelance copywriter and sometimes editor on Fiverr. Different clients have very different projects, but typically I'm writing blog posts and website content for businesses. Other copywriting I do includes neighborhood newsletters and editing content for websites. Most of my work involves some level of SEO as well.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of writing work. I'm curious about how AI fits into all of this.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Typically, I'll take the client's brief and generate one or both of a detailed outline for the project and/or ask for well-researched citations into interesting facts and statistics about the topic.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI more in the research and planning phases. Tell me more about that process. When you say you ask for "well-researched citations" - what does that interaction with AI look like for you?

User: It depends on the level of research needed for the project. On the 'low' end, I'll just ask a search-enabled smart AI (like GPT-5 thinking or Opus 4.1 or Gemini 2.5 Pro) to provide me with some interesting facts and statistics from specifically .edu, .gov, or .org sources (or pdfs) to avoid linking competitive articles. If its a big project I need to know lot of new information for, I like to use deep research - typically OpenAI or Grok's, but also Gemini or Perplexity if I'm not finding what I want. These reports I tend to read more or less fully (at least the interesting parts) and sometimes read the sources too. I then tend to copy-paste a bunch of the more interesting claims into a detailed outline and ask another (usually different AI) to fact check everything I might use for the article.

AI: That's a really thorough research process - it sounds like you've developed quite a sophisticated workflow with multiple AI tools and verification steps. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the writer working on it?

User: One larger project I had was actually writing a report on Solar Energy expansion in the Middle East for a Qatar Solar Company. For this, not only did I use multiple deep research reports, but I also used ChatGPT's ability to make charts to help visualize the data. I did find that o3 (the model I was working with at the time) still struggled with extracting data from a visual chart - like if I uploaded a graph or chart to it, it couldn't read it accurately. This meant I still had to spend a lot of time verifying that it had the correct data for the many charts in the report. In terms of writing help, I tend to prefer 3rd party editing tools (like Grammarly) to strictly asking an AI to help with editing, as it does tend to go overboard.

AI: That Qatar solar project sounds quite complex - you're essentially orchestrating multiple AI tools for different parts of the process. When you were working through that project, how would you describe the collaboration between you and the AI? Who or what was driving the creative decisions about how to present the information and structure the report?

User: In that case, it was very much a research and outlining partner - a tool for the most part. I didn't push it to help creatively too much, but the outline structure was developed with it. I would also say it helped 'creatively' in the sense of which facts and statistics it searched for and found. Those definitely guided my approach. Sometimes I will ask the AI whether it thinks the flow, argument, and general readability of an article I've written is good. I take its opinion with a grain of salt, but it can be helpful.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - AI as a research and outlining partner rather than a creative collaborator. You mentioned taking its opinion "with a grain of salt" when it comes to flow and readability feedback.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: Overall, the time to write an article I would say is 25 to 50% faster, but actually, the main benefit is cognitive flow. If I'm stuck on a part (outlining, researching, writing a section) I can always just ask the AI to give it a try. Sometimes the result is beneficial, sometimes not, but it helps keep things moving if I'm 'dreading the blank page,' so to speak. By 'grain of salt' I mean that often when I ask an AI for creative feedback, it is too zealous with what should be changed, giving feedback that is both vague and broad, but sharp as though 'it has to be changed.' Sometimes I do agree, but I have to remember that it is often pushing things toward a more 'generic' template, so it's important to keep my voice in the writing as well. Oh! I forgot to mention one great feature for my work is 'projects' in OpenAI, as I've carefully developed a custom instructions template and fed the project multiple articles of mine to help guide the style of writing to match my own. It's not fully successful, but it does help for when I do want it to have a go at a rough draft. Claude's 'styles' is similar, but I've been using projects for longer. And of course, I use artefacts and OpenAI's canvas too, although both are often much jankier than I'd like so I will often swap the material in and out of it.

AI: That's fascinating - the idea of cognitive flow and avoiding "dreading the blank page" seems like a really significant impact beyond just time savings. And I love how you've experimented with training the AI on your own writing style through projects and custom instructions.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of copywriting and content creation?

User: Like many, I do believe it does 'deaden' overall voice and feeling of writing throughout the web. However, a lot of website content and blog posts of businesses that I'm doing at the 'low end' doesn't need a lot of that. I already see that AI is taking over these freelance positions, but I'm personally ok with that. I'd like AI to take over a lot of work, although perhaps creative work a little less so. I do think AI can be used as a tool to improve creative works though - I've already seen amazing images and video made from AI. I'm not sure I've seen as beautiful writing, but for those who want to roleplay or for things like video game dialogue, the creative writing of AI is already solid enough to have a lot of fun with.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - accepting that AI might replace certain types of work while seeing potential for it to enhance creativity in other ways. You seem pretty pragmatic about the changes happening in your field.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think for freelance copywriting in particular, it will be the go-to for the vast majority, with only a sliver still left for certain special human voices. More and more people are already turning to video and more multimedia approaches to putting out information on social media and the like. These too, of course, are being affected by AI. Currently, I'm in interviews for AI-first companies looking to leverage AI for content creation, such as making knowledge bases for company chatbots.

AI: It sounds like you're actively adapting and moving toward more AI-integrated roles rather than trying to resist the changes. That transition to working for AI-first companies is really interesting.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool for maintaining cognitive flow and how you've developed such a systematic approach to research verification across multiple AI platforms.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just my two cents, but I think personality, style, and distinction in the creative writing process is necessary to level up AI creative writing. When people just type 'write me an email...' etc. it gives a generic voice. While styles in Claude are a good start, more obvious personalities and 'human-like' styles are probably what will be most useful in the future for creating compelling content with a distinct literary voice. We see see strongly in the image generation sphere, where loras and prompting particular styles, camera angles, painting styles, etc. all come out to influence a particular user's style of generations strongly - so much so that I can recognize some users' generations immediately, their way of prompting is so unique to them (not just ghibli-style or some generic one like that).

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the parallel between image generation and writing - how users develop their own distinctive prompting styles that become almost like a signature. The idea that personality and distinction are what's missing from current AI writing tools is particularly interesting, especially coming from someone who works professionally with these systems every day.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in creative work, from the cognitive flow benefits to the systematic research workflows you've developed, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you were about both the opportunities and the changes happening in your field.
