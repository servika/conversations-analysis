Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, fire away.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am in charge of our higher level research/project design. So I often use AI to help understand new technologies, prototype code up products, build roadmaps and find out what unknowns I do not know I don't know yet in these new technology areas.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're using AI as both a research partner and a discovery tool for those "unknown unknowns." 

Can you walk me through what that process looks like when you're exploring a new technology area? How do you typically start that conversation with AI?

User: Well our current product is getting VIMS, J1939 and any other format of data we can (such as maybe CDL) from caterpillar vehicles. So I  might start by giving it electrical diagrams, asking quesitons about which certain sections mean(since I am more a programmer than a electrical engineer). Or details on how the protocols work for VIMS for example, giving it the frame data we are getting and asking it to break it down and so on

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI to bridge knowledge gaps between disciplines. So you're feeding it electrical diagrams and protocol data, essentially using it as a translator between electrical engineering concepts and your programming background.

When you're working through something like breaking down VIMS frame data, how do you typically structure that interaction? Are you going back and forth with follow-up questions, or do you tend to give it a big chunk of information upfront and ask for a comprehensive breakdown?

User: Generally a larger chunk to start, with as much detail as I can. After that I go back and forth with a few lines per prompt, maybe questioning its answers to get better understanding. Generally goes from 1-10 ish questions in a session, then I might make a new one for different questions.

AI: That makes sense - starting with the full context and then drilling down with focused follow-ups. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your research and project design work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Unless I can positive I can do the task faster, I would ask AI. For example tracing some of the complex electrical diagrams for the cat vehicles is a bit outside the skill of the AI, so using it might slow me down compared to doing it myself. But even though I love coding, if it can be faster at work to use AI, I use it. My job is to produce reuslts, not to have fun. At home for personal I am more likely to code by hand more*, but still not fully.

AI: That's a really practical approach - you're prioritizing results over personal preference, even when it comes to something you enjoy like coding. 

When you say tracing complex electrical diagrams is "outside the skill of AI" and might slow you down - what specifically makes that task challenging for AI? Is it the visual complexity, or something about the reasoning required?

User: Ya visual compelxity, like printing them out on paper is like 50 inch pages, and many of them. AI often just gets confused and makes up wrong data. GPT-5 is better at it, but still not good enough to trust.

AI: Got it - so with those massive, complex diagrams, the AI tends to hallucinate details rather than admit uncertainty, which makes it unreliable for that kind of precise tracing work.

When you are using AI for tasks where it is effective, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate, it makes me faster. I still don't trust it to do things by itself. I feel it makes good people better, but bad people just pump out mid level code fast.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI as an amplifier rather than a replacement. You mentioned not trusting it to work independently and that it can help good people get better while enabling others to produce mediocre work quickly.

What does that collaboration look like in practice for you? How do you maintain that oversight while still getting the speed benefits?

User: I get it to do very specific things, smaller task items, smaller questions. If I leave it to open ended I end up getting the wrong info, or not as useful. So specifically could be asking for decoding specific CAN frames, or visualizations on dashboards then incrementally adding features.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - breaking things down into specific, bounded tasks rather than giving it open-ended prompts. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic approach to getting reliable output.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others on your team using it similarly, or do you see different approaches?

User: All of them use it the same, I insist upon it as the person in charge. I find it really helps productivity, and we have sessions going over basics with new employees on best practices with it

AI: That's really interesting that you've standardized AI use across your team and built it into onboarding. It sounds like you've moved beyond individual adoption to making it a core part of how your team operates.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated is when my CEO will use free AI, like google search gemini and it gives him wrong info all the time and I have to waste my day disproving it. Successful it when it can help me with things like electrical design where I have much less experience, such as building custom connects and getting the right pin outs.

AI: That's a perfect example of the challenges when AI adoption isn't coordinated - you're dealing with the downstream effects of unreliable free tools while getting real value from the more capable versions for technical knowledge transfer.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I consider it, but as I said before I believe it makes good people better. I think it will cut the bottom 25 or 50 percent and I think I am not in that group. It just motivates me to stay on top so that I am not replaced and can use the tools effectivly.

AI: That's a confident and strategic perspective - staying ahead of the curve rather than being displaced by it. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology improves, or changing how you structure your work around it?

User: I might trust it a bit more over time, but I think just making it enhance my workflow is best. But eventually being able to rely on it without it making info up will save me a lot of time.

AI: That makes sense - incremental trust building as the reliability improves, especially around that hallucination issue you've mentioned.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool that amplifies existing capabilities rather than replacing them, and how you've systematically integrated it into your team's workflow.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, all good, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about managing AI adoption at both the individual and team level, along with your practical approach to collaboration versus delegation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
