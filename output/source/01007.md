Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have a lot of different types of tasks that I've been trying to use AI for. A significant task for me is route planning, which often involves repetitive and cumbersome copy-pasting of addresses and optimization. I've been trying to use AI to help me extract relevant addresses or locations from lists, emails, and websites to help me determine worthwhile assignments and efficient routes. I've also used it to reword short responses that I have to write slightly differently but over and over again for certain assignments.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI to tackle some pretty specific operational challenges. 

Tell me more about the route planning work. When you say you're determining "worthwhile assignments," what does that decision-making process look like when you're working with AI versus when you handle it yourself?

User: When I do it myself, I have to input each address, one by one, into Google Maps or a route planning software. Even copy-pasting can be time consuming, repetitive, and boring. Then I have the program calculate the distance and time. I usually use Google Maps, which doesn't optimize the route automatically, so I have to arrange the route myself to try and optimize it. Then I have to calculate whether the total pay for all the assignments is worth the time and vehicle wear and tear/fuel. I've started to use AI to help me with the first parts of extracting addresses and mapping the route. It's helpful because it instantly extracts the addresses, which are sometimes embedded within a long email or webpage with other information. So far, Gemini is the only one that can interact with Google Maps that I'm aware of, so I'm trying to use Gemini to help me with the mapping and optimization parts.

AI: That's a fascinating use case - you're essentially using AI to automate the data extraction and then leveraging its integration capabilities for the optimization piece.

When you're working through this process with AI, how much of the final decision about whether an assignment is "worthwhile" do you leave to the AI versus making that judgment call yourself?

User: So far, I've been making that determination on my own, but I'd like to get to the point of trusting the AI's judgement for this as well.

AI: That's really telling - there's clearly a distinction in your mind between tasks you're ready to hand off and ones where you want to maintain control.

What is it about that final worthiness decision that makes you hesitate to fully delegate it to AI right now? What would need to change for you to feel comfortable trusting AI's judgment on that call?

User: I would need to know that the AI's determination is accurate.

AI: What would accuracy look like to you in that context? How would you know the AI was making the right call about whether an assignment is worthwhile?

User: Accuracy would mean that it didn't miss any location addresses, input all of them correctly, determined the optimal route, and correctly calculated all of the variables.

AI: That makes sense - you're looking for precision across multiple technical steps. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI more broadly. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different from the route planning work?

User: Yes. Right now I still handle things like updating my schedule of assignments and responding to emails from schedulers. I don't think AI is ready to handle those tasks yet, and I wouldn't want there to be an error like responding inappropriately or not at all or misplacing an assignment due date on the calendar.

AI: That's a clear boundary you've drawn. It sounds like the consequences of errors in those communication and scheduling tasks feel much higher risk to you.

When you are using AI - like with the route planning or rewording responses - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: Typically, I work back and forth with the AI on these tasks because it isn't able to handle it entirely on its own from start to finish. I still have to double check its work. With the rewording responses tasks, less input from me is needed because there aren't many steps involved, so I will have the AI complete an entire response for me and then move on to the next response unless I desire changes.

AI: That's helpful - it sounds like the complexity and number of steps in a task influences how much back-and-forth you need.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you discuss AI use with others, or is it more of an individual decision for you?

User: It's an entirely individual decision for me. I have not discussed it with anyone.

AI: Interesting - you're navigating this entirely on your own. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It hasn't particularly blown me away or caused any extreme frustration. Usually the help from AI is good but not amazing. I have been most satisfied with its ability to extract data.

AI: That's an honest perspective - it sounds like AI is functioning as a useful but not transformative tool for you right now.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not concerned with AI taking over any of the skills required for my job since it requires me to physically go to different locations to evaluate conditions and perform different actions. I suppose AI could make it easier for other people to get into my field and complete assignments quicker or with a little less effort, but I'm not concerned about that. Work in my field used to have to be completed entirely with paper and pen and through mail, but is now much easier with the internet and modern computers. I wasn't doing the job back then, but the field has only expanded since then. A part of what I do could be completed by a combination of AI and cameras, but I don't see that happening soon.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - you see AI as the latest in a series of technological advances that have enhanced rather than replaced your field.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think you'll be using it more or differently six months or a year from now?

User: I think AI will get better, and I will be able to rely on it being accurate in time. I think it will get better at sorting through emails, noticing relevant information that is personalized to my needs, and it will get better at interfacing between applications like Gmail and Maps. This will help me quite a bit. I hope to be able to use it for those other tasks like responding to emails, as well as other tasks like alerting me to pertinent emails.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on viewing AI as part of a continuum of technological improvements in your field, and how you're methodically building trust by starting with lower-stakes tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes, I forgot to mention that I would like to start using AI to read project instructions and extract all the requirements for completing assignments for the project, and be able to answer questions I have about the project based on those instructions. I plan to start using AI for this, as I think it is already capable of doing this pretty well.

AI: That's a great addition - thank you for bringing that up. It sounds like you're expanding into using AI for more complex comprehension and reference tasks, which fits with your pattern of gradually increasing the scope of what you delegate as you build confidence in its capabilities.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're methodically integrating AI into your workflow - starting with data extraction, building toward optimization tasks, and considering instruction comprehension - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Can I exit the conversation now?

AI: Absolutely! Thank you again for participating in this interview. You can go ahead and end the conversation whenever you're ready. Your insights have been really valuable for our research.
