Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yes it sounds good, no questions before

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use it on any schedule, but I generally use it 3-4 times a week. Some examples would be when I am reviewing staff numbers, I can input my staff goals for each shift and then my weekly schedule and see how many people I need to hire for each daypart. I have used AI to generate interview questions and create 'scenarios' with guests for the interviewee to solve. I have used it for crew morale events and making fun names for our competitions. I have had it generate tracking sheets for data collection and then I can compare. I also have used it to write apology letters to customers for customer recovery plans.

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses - from staffing calculations to customer recovery. It sounds like you're using AI across quite different aspects of managing your team and operations.

When you mention using it for staffing analysis, where you input your goals and schedule to see hiring needs - how do you typically work through that process? Do you give AI all the information at once, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation to get to the numbers you need?

User: back and forth as I am generating schedules, kind of like live note-taking; before AI I would have used a notebook to keep the notes and then analyze at the end

AI: That's really helpful - so it's become like having a dynamic workspace where you can think through the problem as it develops, rather than working it all out separately first.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I wouldn't use it for anything proprietary to the corp name or with anyones personal information. HR style sit downs I would not use AI because I would not want to give false information by just trusting a model. I would also be more personal with my own experience and training. Also training in general, I would use it to organize training needs and tracking data but not generating material. Anything around food safety I would either use my own confirmed source or double check

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing clear boundaries around sensitive information and areas where accuracy is critical or where your personal expertise really matters.

When you do use AI for those tasks you mentioned - like the staffing calculations or creating interview scenarios - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: always collaborate

AI: Can you tell me more about what that collaboration looks like in practice? When you say you always collaborate, what does that back-and-forth typically involve?

User: So i would be like this week I need 10 people for Breakfast, 12 lunch, 11 dinner and 14 late night. then I would go through the schedule ( monday I have 9, 11, 13, 14 etc)  and then ask for my shortages and overages. I do it as I review a physical schedule. does that make sense. or for morale I need a competition for a friday highest sales then I give some details and a budget and ask for some rules

AI: That makes perfect sense - you're essentially using AI as a thinking partner while you work through the details in real time. You keep control of the process and feed information as you review your materials.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you use it similarly, or has your approach been shaped by how your workplace views these tools?

User: no, I think I might be ahead of a lot of them. They are older and do things from a more by the book approach. We have strict corp rules so I dont even tell the model the company name

AI: Interesting - so you've developed your own approach to staying within those corporate boundaries while still finding AI useful. It sounds like you're being quite thoughtful about compliance even when others aren't necessarily exploring these tools yet.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: the satisfaction came from how much time I saved. it was the meaningless minutes trying to think of funny ways to incorporate burgers and fridays or by quickly learning the day parts I was short. it felt kinda of like brainstorming with myself. i wish there was a way to quickly input reviews or inventory data from my pos system

AI: That's a great description - "brainstorming with myself" really captures that collaborative feel you mentioned. And it sounds like the time savings on those smaller but mentally draining tasks has been really valuable.

You mentioned wishing you could quickly input data from your POS system. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over more tasks? Is this something you actively consider?

User: yes and thats a fine line. the things i do now are meaningless, but if AI could review my food cost numbers for example and generate action plans, that is a lot of my job so I would start to worry about my importance or if as many people were needed. one person could run 10 stores instead of 3-4.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - there's clearly a difference between AI helping with the "meaningless" tasks versus potentially taking over core parts of your expertise and value as a manager.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll maintain those boundaries you've established?

User: at this point I dont see any real need in expanding, I save time at work and I feel like I am a bit more organized and creative. it helped my time management and i like my routine

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've thought through the boundaries between helpful time-saving tasks and the core expertise that defines your role - that balance between efficiency and maintaining your professional value.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no i think i covered it

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative thinking partner while maintaining clear boundaries around sensitive information and core expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits - like the time savings and improved organization - and your thoughtful approach to where AI fits and where it doesn't in your management role.

Thanks again for participating in our research!
