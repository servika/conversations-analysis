Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I am set to begin

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use AI for research on legal topics and writing correspondence

AI: That's interesting - research and correspondence are such core parts of legal work. 

When you say research on legal topics, what does that process typically look like for you? Walk me through how you might approach a research task with AI.

User: So, first I will ask for the Tennessee Code Annotated that refers to the problem/issue. Or other regulations that might apply like federal laws. Then I might ask for the model to compile a list of other cases that are similar to these and provide the case study.

AI: That sounds like a very structured approach - starting with the statutes and then building out to case law. 

When you're working through that research process, how do you typically interact with the AI? Are you going back and forth with follow-up questions as you dig deeper, or do you tend to ask for everything you need upfront and then work with what you get back?

User: I always ask for citations so I can just click the links and not rely on the model because it does make mistakes. I do participate in back and forth follow up questions to dig deeper.

AI: That's a really smart verification approach - using the AI as a starting point but then checking the actual sources yourself. 

Tell me more about that back and forth process when you're digging deeper. What kinds of follow-up questions do you find yourself asking most often?

User: Well for instance, I was recently trying to find information about regulations around solid waste transfer facilties. So, first I started with state law and regulations around them with citations, then I asked for federal laws around these facilities. Then after reading those citations, I asked it to find case law surrounding communities fighting against these facilities operating in their area. Then I asked for further news stories around a particular citation it provided.

AI: That's a fascinating example - you're essentially building layers of understanding, from the regulatory framework down to real-world applications and community impacts.

When you were working through that solid waste transfer facility research, were there points where you decided to take over certain parts of the investigation yourself rather than continuing to use AI? What made you choose to handle some aspects personally versus delegating them to the AI?

User: When it comes to reasoning, like how could these laws apply to the current situation I am researching for, I use my own reasoning. I have tried to use the models in the past but it gives bad legal advice. For instance, it suggested that transfer facilities fall under Jackson Law in Tennessee when the regulatory framework treats them as just a fee simple permit where jackson law does not apply.

AI: That's a really telling example - the AI misapplying Jackson Law when the regulatory framework is completely different. It sounds like you've learned to draw a clear line between using AI for information gathering versus legal analysis and application.

How did you figure out where that boundary should be? Was it through experiences like that Jackson Law example, or did you approach it more cautiously from the start?

User: I actually learned over time to not trust anything it says 100% when it has to be factual. I always ask for citations so I can prove for myself that the advice or information it provides is correct.  It was mostly through my initial experiences that I learned this tactic.

AI: That's such a practical evolution - developing your own verification system based on real experience. It sounds like you've found a way to harness AI's research capabilities while protecting yourself from its factual limitations.

I'm curious about your colleagues or your workplace culture - how have they influenced the way you use AI in your work, if at all?

User: My colleagues are more skeptical of AI and don't trust it or they trust it too much and make legal mistakes because they don't research it. I had a colleague who was a city recorder, he followed the legal advice from Google Ai on the search engine and made the city a costly mistake.  It reminds me to never blindly trust what Ai says if it is the first time I am seeing that information.

AI: That's a striking contrast - colleagues who either avoid it completely or trust it too much, with real consequences like that costly city mistake. It sounds like you've found a middle ground that your experience taught you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had a issue that I was trying to find the solution to. I had been trying to find a legal loophole for about three days but I just couldn't figure it out. I asked my coworkers and they had nothing. So, I thought, I will just ask this model and see what it says. It actually found a legal angle that I had not considered yet. It supplied all the citations I needed to prove it as well. It was amazing!  I was so excited to share it with everyone and the tactic won in court!

AI: That sounds like an incredible breakthrough moment - three days of searching and then AI opens up an angle you hadn't even considered! The fact that it held up in court must have been incredibly validating.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel like the best thing I can do in maintaining my skills is learning how to utilize Ai efficiently.  I don't think that Ai will ever fully replace my job because I have to think about the human aspect of it. I have to speak and try to  influence others to agree with my stance, which Ai can't do.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing AI proficiency as a skill itself, while recognizing the irreplaceable human elements like persuasion and interpersonal influence.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as you get more experience with it?

User: I hope that as the technology develops, it stops making as many mistakes and I don't have to read all the legal framework myself. I will be able to trust more of its judgements blindly and it can save me hours of reading.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on finding that middle ground between your colleagues who either avoid AI completely or trust it too blindly - and how that costly city mistake reinforced your verification approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I am think of

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that verification system through trial and error, and especially that story about finding the legal angle that won in court, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and the pitfalls you've encountered. Have a great rest of your day!
