Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for arranging schedules, meeting agendas, planning staff activities and guest lunches/menus. I sometimes use it for writing interview questions or helping me write interview scripts or scripts for phone calls. I also use it for research

AI: That's a really diverse set of uses. You mentioned research - what kind of research do you typically have AI help you with?

User: Policy protocol research, best practices kind of thing, etc. I like to know what the latest research says on different topics, like staff management, workplace wellness, working from home vs remote, that kind of thing

AI: That sounds really valuable for staying current on management practices. When you're doing this kind of research, how do you typically work with AI? Do you give it a broad topic and let it handle the research, or do you guide it through specific questions as you go?

User: Typically I start with a broad topic and then guide it through more specific topics as we go. Like based on what the AI tells me about the broad topic, I'll narrow in on certain sections of information. And if what the AI says leads me to ask a question, I'll ask it

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really natural. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer writing sensitive or potentially difficult emails on my own. These are ones that I feel like need a human touch

AI: That makes a lot of sense. What is it about those sensitive emails that feels like it needs that human touch? What would be different if AI wrote them versus when you write them yourself?

User: When AI writes them, it sounds like AI - less personal, more distant. Not like me. I like these emails to sound natural and authentic.

AI: I can understand that distinction - maintaining your authentic voice in sensitive situations. When you use AI for writing interview questions or phone call scripts, how does that work differently? What makes those tasks feel appropriate for AI assistance?

User: Those calls or questions are less personal in nature - more universal. They're not for dealing with tricky employee situations or anything that could bring up a lot of feelings.

AI: That's a helpful distinction. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: It's encouraged to use AI as long as we're getting things done efficiently and to a high standard. So it has led me to use AI more, I would say

AI: That kind of supportive environment sounds helpful. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, I get frustrated when I'm trying to craft an agenda or schedule and the AI doesn't meet all my requirements. Like let's say I need to plan a staff event and the AI doesn't hit all the agenda items I need in the allotted times I requested - that's frustrating

AI: That sounds really frustrating when the logistics don't line up properly. When that happens with scheduling or agenda planning, what do you typically do next? Do you keep working with the AI to refine it, or do you switch to handling it yourself?

User: I usually try once or twice to get the AI to refine it. If that doesn't work, I do it myself

AI: That makes sense - there's a practical limit to how much back-and-forth is worth it. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Sure, I guess it's somewhat of a concern. But I see AI more as a tool to enhance my work than competition.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - viewing it as enhancement rather than replacement. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see myself using it for the same things I am now and potentially some new areas, like data interpretation perhaps

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on distinguishing between tasks that need your authentic human voice versus those that are more universal in nature.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance AI assistance with maintaining that personal touch in sensitive communications, and your collaborative approach to research, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
