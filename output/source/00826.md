Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good - I have no questions at this stage!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I would typically use AI for menial tasks such as drafting emails, and sorting data into tables. I would also use it for preliminary research tasks or to identify starting points/points of interest for research projects, but never to develop full research briefs.

AI: That's helpful - it sounds like you've found specific niches where AI adds value to your workflow. 

When you mention using it for preliminary research to identify starting points, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically structure that interaction?

User: With some client projects, this will often require researching the economic history of a certain industry or geographic area. I will rely on AI to do an initial scan of the industry/area and surface the most relevant historical aspects I should then look into myself, to dig deeper. This will often just be a broad prompt to identify all relevant economic factors to the client's specific project, and then I take over personally from there.

AI: That's a really interesting approach - using AI as a kind of scanning tool to map the landscape before you dive deeper yourself. 

I'm curious about that handoff point where you "take over personally." What makes you decide that's where AI should step back and you should take the lead? What's different about that deeper research phase for you?

User: A lot of historical data in my country of residence is not digitised/contained in paper format archives. For this reason, a human is required to take over the research process at this stage in order to acquire the most relevant and accurate historical information. Similarly, research approaches and specific research questions often are related to confidential client information/confidential instructions from the client, which is not permitted to be shared with public AI platforms.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the physical archive limitation and confidentiality requirements create clear boundaries for where AI can and can't be helpful.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you're comfortable delegating?

User: I prefer to handle any task myself where the consequences of AI hallucination are more than minimally significant (eg: could damage a relationship with client or my senior, could detrimentally affect downstream deliverables if shown to be erroneous later). I also prefer to handle any brainstorming tasks myself, as over-reliance on AI could lead to more narrow and structured thinking rather than the innovative approaches required.

AI: That's a thoughtful risk assessment approach - weighing the potential consequences of errors against the efficiency gains. 

You mentioned brainstorming and the concern about AI leading to more narrow thinking. Can you tell me more about that? What happens when you brainstorm with AI versus when you do it yourself?

User: My perception is that relying on AI for brainstorming is detrimental to your own ability to brainstorm fully and unrestricted, in the same way that it would be if you went to someone else for their ideas before you brainstormed.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - the idea that AI might act like getting someone else's ideas too early in your process. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will delegate it complete tasks, as mentioned, mainly menial ones or initial research queries. There is very little collaboration throughout the lifespan of a project, as you mentioned.

AI: That delegation approach seems to align well with your earlier points about maintaining control over higher-stakes work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach is similar to others around you, or different?

User: In my workplace our use of public AI platforms is dictated by policies aimed at maintaining the confidentiality of private data; however, there is still broad use of these platforms for tasks similar to those I've described. The design teams within our workplace also effectively use design AI platforms to enhance their work. I do recognise some over-reliance on AI with certain individuals, to the point where it has been recognised by seniors in the teams.

AI: That's interesting that there's enough variation in usage that seniors have noticed over-reliance in some cases. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The use of AI to quickly draft update emails to clients about quite minor details has been most satisfying - when I take about 5-10 minutes to draft an email, and there is 7-8 of them a day, the time savings are significant.

AI: That's a great concrete example of where AI really delivers value - those repetitive but necessary communications that add up over the day.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not at this stage, no - the limitations of AI (including lack of perceived trustworthiness) prevent it from seriously threatening the core areas of my work.

AI: That confidence in your core work being protected is interesting. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops, or do you think those fundamental boundaries you've described will remain?

User: Mass societal buy in will be required in order to change the fundamental boundaries I've described.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the broader societal context being key to any major shifts.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the clear risk-based boundaries you've established and how physical archives and confidentiality requirements create natural limits to AI's usefulness in your field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've strategically integrated AI for specific, lower-risk tasks while maintaining control over the core analytical and creative aspects of your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached finding that balance between efficiency and maintaining the quality and confidentiality standards your work requires.

Have a great rest of your day!
