Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds great

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My work varies project to project, but usually it involves a client giving me a script or a rough idea and it's my job to bring it to life through illustration and design. I generally like to mull over what I've been given along with what the client is desiring before I start a thumbnail sketching process. Currently I'm working on illustrating two different children's books.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work! I can imagine each project brings its own unique creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I really like to use AI tools when I just can't find a good reference image for a pose I'm trying to capture or a lot of the times I love using AI tools when I really need extra help with composition and scene layout. It cuts my time in half having the tools to help generate these compositions.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you solve some very specific technical challenges in your work.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I've used it for two different projects recently, one was to help brainstorm a very specific painting for a client that involved the client's pets. I used AI to generate images of what the paintings would look like finished. Another project I used it for was to help design a book cover layout that I was pressed for time to illustrate. I will say, that AI is great for this but there are times that it doesn't quite generate exactly what I ask for, sometimes it will do its own thing and generate something similar like if I ask for two corgis in the night sky jumping over floating bananas it might give me three corgis or two corgis in the background or maybe it will give me a weird looking night sky, which can make the process longer. That part is slightly annoying.

AI: That's a great example of both the possibilities and the friction points. It sounds like there's this tension between AI being helpful for time-sensitive work but also sometimes creating its own complications.

When you're working with AI in those situations - like generating those pet painting concepts or the book cover layouts - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I would say the AI is driving a good bit of the concepts, I simply try to guide it. So the collaboration would be about 60/40 (60% AI, 40% my ideas). I just feel I have less control once I've told the AI what I'm looking for, then it's a matter of whether or not the AI interprets the directions well or not.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - the 60/40 split and that sense of having less control once you've given the AI direction. It sounds like there's this handoff moment where you're somewhat at the mercy of how well it interprets what you're asking for.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Oh! Definitely compositions. Sometimes it would be a struggle for me with really complicated scene layouts that require intense perspective shots. Now I can use AI to help with that and it takes a good bit of pressure off of my shoulders with making sure I get it right. Also, it helps with writing, when I'm putting a treatment together, or outlining a script idea. It's very helpful with those things as well, but again, sometimes it can generate something that feels like a default piece. And, color palettes, when I'm coloring pages for comics and I might need help with generating a mood palette for the page, it's very good for that as well. I'm very skilled in color theory but there are times that I'm mentally drained and need the extra help. Does that make sense?

AI: That makes complete sense - it sounds like AI has become this valuable support system for when you're mentally fatigued or facing particularly challenging technical aspects like perspective work. The way you describe it, it's almost like having a creative assistant that can help carry some of the cognitive load.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Personally, I feel like it has the potential to be exactly the way you described it, a valuable support system for when I'm mentally fatigued or facing difficult challenges with technical aspects of the work I do. My concerns are with people and companies trying to abuse AI by using it as a replacement for artists and creatives like myself who've spent years training and honing our skills. I'm also slightly concerned about the use of AI stealing work to generate images for people who want to call themselves artists but lack the proper skills, training and experience.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - between AI as a tool that enhances your existing skills versus it being used to bypass the years of training and experience you've developed. It sounds like you see a clear difference between using AI to support your creative process and using it to replace that process entirely.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see it becoming more refined so that the process of generating reference images, color palettes, and composition layouts becomes more streamlined. The more advanced the models become the more intuitive of a personal artist assistant I will have. Perhaps even using it to help me complete multiple projects under tight deadlines. I hope that answers your question.

AI: That absolutely answers my question - it's clear you have a very pragmatic vision of AI becoming more like a sophisticated, intuitive creative partner that helps you manage workload and tight deadlines.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that 60/40 collaboration split and how you distinguish between AI as a support tool versus a replacement for artistic skills and training.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really, the only other thing is when AI generates images with weird deformities. That's still happening, and while quite hilarious, it can be equally frustrating when there's a deadline present.

AI: That's a perfect note to end on - the reality that even as AI becomes more sophisticated, those unexpected quirks and deformities can still throw a wrench in the works, especially when you're racing against a deadline. It really captures that tension between the promise of these tools and their current limitations.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate this balance between leveraging AI as a creative assistant while maintaining your artistic integrity and skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the benefits and the frustrations.

User: you're welcome

AI: Thank you so much! It's been a pleasure speaking with you. Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with those children's book illustrations you're working on!
