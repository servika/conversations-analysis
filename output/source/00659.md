Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an SEO copywriter. As of about a year ago, we've been required to use AI as part of our writing process. I admittedly have gotten a bit lazy with it, and tend to generate entire articles based on an outline, which I then edit to have more of a human touch. Ideally, I would be mostly using AI for ideation and research.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like there's a gap between how you're currently using AI and how you think you should be using it. 

When you say you've gotten "a bit lazy" with generating entire articles, what does that editing process look like for you? How do you add that human touch?

User: AI writing is much too stilted and repetitive to be okay to submit to clients. So if I've generated a blog for example, I do a thorough read-through, adjusting sentence structure, word choice, and organization until it sounds more conversational. Sometimes, I'll even add sentence structures that aren't technically grammatically correct (like ending with a preposition) because that's how a real person would say it.

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially doing a translation from AI language to human language. 

Tell me more about what makes you recognize something as "AI writing" versus human writing. What are the specific patterns or characteristics that tip you off?

User: I see words repeated all the time-"elevate" and "transform" are big offenders. I also see sentences with this structure a lot: I drive slowly, allowing cars to pass me. The AI I used likes to do a phrase following by a comma, and a second clause beginning with a gerund.

AI: Those are really specific patterns you've picked up on - the repetitive vocabulary and that particular sentence structure with the gerund. It sounds like you've developed quite an eye for AI's linguistic habits.

You mentioned earlier that ideally you'd be using AI more for ideation and research rather than full article generation. What's keeping you from working that way? What makes the current approach feel easier despite requiring all that editing work?

User: I write about the same topics over and over, and it's quite boring to come up with new organizations for very similar subjects. I'd rather just generate the content, edit it for human-ness and be done with it.

AI: That makes complete sense - when you're covering similar ground repeatedly, the organizational heavy lifting becomes the tedious part rather than the actual writing and editing.

So it sounds like AI is helping you get past that initial hurdle of structuring content on familiar topics. When you do that thorough editing pass to make it sound more conversational, how do you feel about that work? Is that part engaging for you, or does it feel like just another step you have to get through?

User: No, at this point, everything at my day job is just something I have to get through. When I write using AI it isn't rewarding or engaging at all.

AI: That's a pretty candid response - it sounds like the work has become quite mechanical for you. 

Can you tell me about a time before you were using AI for this kind of writing? How did that work feel different, if at all?

User: I do lots of freelance work without the use of AI. It's much more fun for me to do my own research and really delve into the some of the topics I write about. I especially enjoy doing interview-based content without the use of AI. At my full-time job, I have to be quick in the interest of productivity, so I kind of feel forced to use AI.

AI: That's a really striking contrast - enjoying the research and interview work on your freelance projects versus feeling forced into the AI workflow at your full-time job for productivity reasons.

When you're doing that interview-based content without AI, what specifically makes that work more engaging for you? What's happening in that process that feels different?

User: I get to talk to be people with interesting stories, then structure their quotes along with my own exposition. It feels like putting a puzzle together.

AI: That puzzle analogy is really vivid - weaving together someone's quotes with your own writing to create something cohesive. There's clearly a craft element there that you find satisfying.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned it became required about a year ago - how did that shift happen?

User: I was one of two people chosen to try a few different AI tools. I work at a massive company and the AI push is coming from the top. I'm pretty detached from my colleagues, so I wouldn't say they've influenced my AI use

AI: So you were actually part of the pilot group that tested different tools before the broader rollout - that's an interesting position to be in.

When you were testing those different AI tools initially, was there a particular moment or situation where using AI made you feel either particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had no training in prompting AI models, so I would often input a blog topic, only for the AI to misunderstand what I was going for and give me something useless. It's gotten better since I've had more insight into what makes a usable prompt.

AI: That learning curve with prompting sounds like it was pretty frustrating initially. It's interesting that you had to figure out how to communicate effectively with the AI on your own.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given that you're seeing the difference in your freelance work versus your day job?

User: I think about this all the time actually. I sometimes feel like I can barely write by myself anymore, and I've really had to be intentional about not using it in my freelance work. I'm really not sure how to maintain my personal writing skills other than reading widely, particularly fiction and published nonfiction works.

AI: That concern about feeling like you can "barely write by yourself anymore" is really striking - it sounds like there's a genuine worry about skill atrophy.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see things continuing on the current path, or do you hope for changes in how you're able to use it?

User: At this point, I think the inclusion of AI in the writing profession is inevitable. I can really only see writers like myself becoming more reliant on it over time, but I hope clients continue to see the value in human writing. Many already do, but they show their commitment by using AI checkers (often AI tools themselves) to weed out potential generated content. These checkers are famously unreliable though.

AI: That's such an interesting paradox - clients wanting human writing but using unreliable AI tools to detect AI writing. It sounds like there's this strange feedback loop developing in the industry.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the contrast between your freelance work - that puzzle-like quality of weaving together interviews - versus the more mechanical feel of your day job.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between productivity demands and creative satisfaction, and especially your concerns about skill maintenance, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candor throughout our conversation. Take care!
