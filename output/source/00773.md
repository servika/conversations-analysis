Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use it to re-work or formulate emails or other professional communications. I work with PHI so I cannot use it for a lot of applications, although we do have our own internal AI that does bioinformatics

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're navigating both the opportunities and constraints that come with AI in a healthcare environment. 

When you say you use AI to re-work or formulate emails and professional communications, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: If I need to send an email to someone in a different department, I will type the main message I want to say into an AI and ask it to write the email for me. Example, I'd say "I need to write an email to say that this sample failed, but it's also a proficiency testing case, and the -2 sample (I have the -1) is low volume so I don't know if I should pull it."

AI: That's a very specific example - thank you. So you're essentially using AI to help translate your technical thoughts into more polished professional communication.

When you get that email back from the AI, what do you typically do with it? Do you send it as-is, or do you find yourself making adjustments before it goes out?

User: Usually I adjust it

AI: Tell me more about those adjustments. What kinds of changes do you typically make to the AI-generated emails?

User: I'll have it make the message more concise usually or use less "flourished" language. Usually that's how people can tell if it's an AI response, if it's overly formal or uses language that's over the top.

AI: That's a great observation about the telltale signs of AI-generated content. It sounds like you've developed a good sense for calibrating the tone.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are probably tasks I could use AI for, but I err on the side of caution because our workflow is proprietary, so I wouldn't want to expose any of our data to an AI. I would leave anything outside of communication to another department to decide what is acceptable/ unacceptable to use AI for.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the proprietary nature of your workflow creates clear boundaries around what feels safe to share with AI.

When you use AI for those communications, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine the message, or do you tend to give it the initial prompt and work with what it gives you?

User: I almost always have to refine the language.

AI: Got it - so there's usually that iterative process of refining. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people openly discuss using it, or is it more of an individual decision?

User: We have training videos about AI and documents outlining the use of it. One of my colleagues was using it this week to write emails and her application to another position within the company.

AI: That's helpful context - it sounds like there's some formal guidance but also practical, everyday usage happening among your colleagues.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm usually satisfied. For example, I was helping that coworker with her follow-up email after her interview for the new position and we asked for different ways to say that the interview "deepened her interest in the role"

AI: That sounds like a collaborative moment where AI helped you both find the right way to express something important. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes I consider that a lot. I work in a clinical setting and a lot of our processes are automated. Some processes are yet to be automated and we have to troubleshoot ourselves, which is what makes the job interesting. I fear that AI will take away some of those times where we must manually intervene. For example, we manually scan our electropheregram data for abnormalities, which is something an AI could probably do, but I would prefer to retain that responsibility.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're identifying the parts of your work that feel most engaging and meaningful to you. The manual scanning for abnormalities sounds like it requires both technical skill and professional judgment.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am looking to change careers into a more creative field and work for myself, so I imagine I'll be interacting more personally with AI in the future for business tasks like website design

AI: That's an exciting transition you're planning! It sounds like you're anticipating AI will play a different role when you're working independently in a creative field compared to your current clinical environment.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to retain the manual troubleshooting aspects that make your current job interesting - that really highlights how people think about preserving the meaningful parts of their work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That about sums it up.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in a regulated healthcare environment, the importance of maintaining those engaging manual processes, and how you refine AI-generated communications will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
