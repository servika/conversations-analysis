Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, I have no questions, you may begin

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in the electrical field and electronics, and the systems that control them, I have a SCADA network of 40 nodes that operators use to manufacture product.  I am the administrator of this network.  Recently,  our insurance agent informed me that I needed to disable USB ports on all of these nodes.  I knew I could do it through a gp or regedit, but thought there should be a way to do it in a batch.  I consulted our workplace AI which wrote me a script and helped me apply it to the network.

AI: That's a great example of using AI to solve a specific technical challenge. Tell me more about that process - when you consulted your workplace AI for the USB port script, how did that interaction unfold? Did you work back and forth with it, or did it give you something that worked right away?

User: no, I had to work back and forth with it.  The first copy of the powershell script it wrote had errors, which powershell pointed out.  I informed the AI of the errors, but it was unable to correct and I had to finish editing the script myself

AI: That's really insightful - so you ended up in this collaborative process where the AI gave you a starting point, but you had to take over when it hit its limits with the error corrections.

When you think about that experience, how did it compare to if you had just tackled the USB port problem entirely on your own from the beginning? Was the AI's initial attempt helpful even though you had to finish it yourself?

User: The AI's attempt was key to successfully building the script, as I have very limited coding ability, I only program in ladder logic, and some BASIC in the 1980s.  By myself, I would have had to do multiple websearches or started learning to write scripts, which would have been inconvenient, as the project had a completion date that would have been impossible for me to learn in time.  I probably would have abandoned the script idea and edited each machine one by one.

AI: That really highlights how the AI became a crucial bridge for you - giving you enough of a foundation that you could build on with your existing technical skills, even without deep scripting knowledge.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your electrical and SCADA work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The electrical is mainly hands on, and devices are not allowed in the workspace at this time.  For the network, I absolutely see myself certainly using the ai for scripting duties, even if I have to tweek them it was a huge help giving me that foundation.

AI: That makes sense - the physical, hands-on electrical work stays in your domain, while the network scripting becomes a natural collaboration point with AI.

When you use AI for these network tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Based on what you shared about the USB script, it sounds like you tend to go back and forth with it rather than just handing off complete tasks. Is that generally how you prefer to work with it?

User: Correct.  It is not fully integrated into my network, so a back and forth is the only way to work with it at this time.  I have the control network for the facility, and a corporate network for the company, and the AI resides on the corp network.

AI: That network separation creates an interesting workflow constraint. You have to bridge between the two networks yourself to make the collaboration work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your facility using it similarly, or do you find yourself being more of an early adopter in this area?

User: At this time, in the OT field at my workplace, I am the only person that has used AI to help with a work task on the process network, so VERY early adopter at my site.  However, the suggestion to have AI write the script was passed down from coworkers in the OT department at a sister facility.

AI: So you're pioneering AI use for operational technology at your site, but you're actually part of a broader network of OT professionals sharing these approaches across facilities. That's fascinating.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: well, the instance we are talking about had me frustrated, as I knew nothing about scripting, and the AI could not complete it.  Even when I told it what it did wrong, it could not complete it correctly.  I had to restart the task quite a few times to get it to a point where I could finish it.

AI: That frustration sounds really understandable - especially when you're working against a deadline and depending on the AI to bridge that knowledge gap you mentioned. 

When you say you had to restart the task quite a few times, what was happening that made you decide to start over rather than keep trying to correct it? Was the AI getting stuck in the same errors, or were new problems emerging?

User: It was getting stuck on the original problem, and creating new problems as we went along, to the point where it was just easier to start fresh.

AI: That's a really telling pattern - the AI getting into these error loops that actually compound the problem rather than solving it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially as you're exploring these scripting applications?

User: I'm not sure I understand the question fully.  Are you asking me if I'm worried that AI could take over some areas of my work, if so, I expect it to, as this example shows, it is better than me at the bulk of the work, but I still had to be there to oversee it and do the final corrections.  I expect that will be the way AI integrates into my work.

AI: You've captured that really well - this expectation of AI handling the bulk of certain work while you provide the oversight and final corrections. That seems like a very realistic view based on your actual experience.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding into other areas beyond scripting, or deepening how you use it for network administration tasks?

User: I know that AI will be coming into my process network, as the newest versions of the software on that network has AI integration, and I've seen examples of it programming ladder logic based on the users request.  Much like my scripting example, someone with no or very little ladder logic knowledge soon could be programming PLCs at a basic level.

AI: That's really striking - the parallel between your scripting experience and what's coming with ladder logic programming. Someone without deep PLC knowledge being able to program at a basic level with AI assistance.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being an early adopter in OT while still being part of a broader community sharing these approaches across facilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that covers it.  I enjoyed our conversation.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about bridging the gap between limited coding knowledge and complex technical tasks, and your realistic view of AI as a collaborative tool that still requires human oversight and correction, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through that USB port scripting example in detail - it painted a clear picture of how this collaboration actually works in practice. Thanks again!
