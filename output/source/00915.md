Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, sounds good. Let's start!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually like to use AI for help with my small business. I run an Etsy shop where I sell digital downloads for royal icing transfers. So I'll use ChatGPT for coming up with new ideas or how to refine my item descriptions. I also like to get feedback from AI on my listings and what kind of better tags I could implement for better SEO.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI to help with the creative and marketing sides of your Etsy business. 

When you're working on something like coming up with new design ideas for your royal icing transfers, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you and the AI work together on that?

User: I just explain that I have an etsy shop and have lots of transfers already, but that I need more ideas. Sometimes my creativity just isn't there and I still need new listings to post. It'll usually give me most that I already have but I just have to work with it and let it know categories that I'm pretty good on. I try and get it to think about "out of the box" things.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like there's this back-and-forth where you have to guide the AI away from the obvious ideas you already have. 

Tell me more about what "out of the box" things means to you. What does that conversation look like when you're trying to push it in that direction?

User: I give examples of more unique things and steer it towards like more intricate stuff. Like I have shapes covered and things like bees, but I want it to think of stuff like...sloths or something. I want it to help with things I might not be familiar with like things that are popular in other countries but unheard of here (since my shop is online and available to the world).

AI: That's such a smart approach - leveraging AI's broader knowledge to tap into trends or cultural elements you might not be aware of locally. 

When you're getting feedback on your listings or working on better SEO tags, how does that interaction typically unfold? Do you share your current listing with the AI and ask for suggestions, or does it work differently?

User: Yes exactly that. I just post what I have and ask for refinement or suggestions that would garner more attention to the listing (since of course I want to sell more).

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in running your Etsy shop that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Hm I guess I like to do the actual designing of my listing photos and the transfers themselves, even though I could technically let an AI do it. I just don't think AI is capable of producing the same quality of work that I am.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping control over the core creative work that defines your product quality.

When you are using AI for those tasks you mentioned - like brainstorming ideas or refining descriptions - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a task and let it handle it independently?

User: I like to collaborate for sure. It rarely gets it right on the first try, so I have to tailor it a bit. But that's fine I think because it helps me with brainstorming too.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really valuable for your creative process.

How have your colleagues or other business owners in your space - maybe other Etsy sellers you know - influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you talked with others about using these tools?

User: I haven't really talked about it with other etsy owners, but I know there are some contentions regarding AI in the art/creative space. There are some people who over utilize AI to an extent where the product is very low quality. So I know that side is not very good for the creative side of making things. However, I think most people see nothing wrong with using AI as a tool, like I do, to better my shop and have better SEO while still making things myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI as a tool to enhance your business operations while keeping the actual creative work in your hands.

Can you share a time when using AI for your shop made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't think of a time I got super frustrated. Maybe when it was giving me a bunch of simple, obvious ideas that I already have. For the most part I would say I end up satisfied with what it comes up with. Especially when it ends up giving me 5+ ideas that I can use.

AI: That sounds like when it really delivers, it delivers well - giving you that productive burst of usable ideas.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially with the creative and marketing sides of your business?

User: Not so much the creative side, but definitely on the marketing side. The vast information on SEO and optimization available to AI is something I just cannot compete with.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - recognizing where AI has access to more comprehensive information than you could reasonably keep up with.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI in your business evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different tasks as time goes on?

User: Possibly. At the moment I have a good balance, but possibly in the future when I feel like AI can handle more and give higher quality results I might use it for more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your business. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI as a tool while keeping the core creative work that defines your product quality in your own hands.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope! I think that's it.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that sweet spot between using AI as a business tool while maintaining creative control will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how you've integrated AI into your Etsy business - it's a great example of thoughtful, strategic use of these tools.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
