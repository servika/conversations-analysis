Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a content creator for a website and podcast. I use AI for writing, organizing, brainstorming, and research.

AI: That's a great range of uses. Can you walk me through what one of those tasks actually looks like when you're working on it? For instance, when you say you use AI for writing - what does that process typically involve?

User: My website is dedicated to mental wellness and overcoming depression. I write weekly articles, have larger content series available, and also produce a weekly podcast. I use AI to help me sort through the fuzzy ideas my brain clings onto. Through questions, I get the AI to look at my idea from different angles. If I'm writing about seasonal depression, I'll ask AI for another perspective to include, such as the children of the affected person, or friends that don't understand it. I like to make everything as well rounded as possible. Then, I will generate lists of ideas to include in my article. Again, if its season depression, I would ask AI to give me a list of symptoms, a list of severe symptoms to worry about, a list of activities to combat it, a list of cheerful ways to add some lightness in the home, etc....  From these lists I create my outline. I use AI to check my outline to see if I need to add more, or change things. It usually doesn't add too much, but it has been valuable enough that I still use it.  I will use AI for my podcast outlines, to plan my workbook series, and to plan my next project. Lately, I've been trying to use it for a different purpose. I have 4 or 5 complete stories I have written over the years but never did anything with. I am attempting to feed my stories into AI in chunks to see if it can help create a better product.

AI: That's fascinating how you use AI as a thinking partner to explore different angles on your topics. When you mention feeding your stories into AI in chunks to create a better product - can you tell me more about what you're hoping AI will help you accomplish with those stories? What would "a better product" look like to you?

User: I'd love to end up with a fabulous book that I can sell! So, the first one I've selected is something I wrote during the height of Covid lockdown. It's a combination coming of age story during the pandemic. I started by feeding AI my synopsis and what I'm looking for. Then, I gave it the outline so it has the story structure. Then I started loading the first three chapters. I'd ask the AI to soak in the info and wait for more instructions. Once it had done that, I have asked it to change certain characters around, change the main character, make one boy turn into a girl. Things that authors think about but don't really want to write an entire new book just to see how it would turn out. Now I'm working on altering the story. I ask AI to make changes, and sometimes I ask it for its opinion. Most of its opinions are not very good. The story is written for a specific time and place, and is anchored by events of that time and place. But AI keeps trying to switch the location from [REDACTED] to [REDACTED].

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're experimenting with AI as a creative collaborator, but you're finding its suggestions don't always align with your vision. When you say AI's opinions "are not very good" and it keeps suggesting changes you don't want, how do you handle that in the moment? Do you find yourself pushing back against its suggestions, or does it make you question your own creative instincts?

User: If the answer is interesting, I'll run with it. If I directly ask it to produce something, I will usually run with it. But when it suggests changes that don't line up with the story, I tell it to get back on track.

AI: That makes sense - you're maintaining creative control while being open to useful input. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The outline! That goes for articles, larger content, and podcast scripts. The outline is everything. You have to have a solid outline with a definite direction to follow. The AI can create an outline, but I don't trust it yet. I think this is because I have, in my head, the complete story, the side stories, the examples, the quotes, etc...and so it has to be just right to line those all up where it makes sense and flows nicely.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the outline being where all your internal knowledge and vision needs to come together. It sounds like you see that as requiring your deep understanding of the content in a way AI can't quite replicate yet.

When you are using AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it throughout a task. Writer's are very finnicky about their work! I love the ease of brainstorming and research with AI, but I have to have creative control or it isn't my work.

AI: That creative control aspect really comes through in how you describe your process. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're a content creator, I'm curious if there are any expectations or conversations in your field about AI use?

User: There are A LOT of conversations in my field about AI use. When AI first became available, most of the companies I work with denounced it and wouldn't allow its use in the field. Well, AI has gotten a lot better, and I really think it has gotten to the point where, if properly channeled, it can create something original that isn't obviously made by AI. I was super curious about AI and have been playing with it for years.

AI: That shift from companies denouncing it to it becoming more acceptable is really significant. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I work for companies that do not allow it, I get very frustrated because AI is such an efficiency tool and can save oodles amount of time. When I use it for my own content creation, I feel very satisfied that I can get things accomplished in one day that used to take me a week.

AI: That's such a stark difference - going from a week's work to a day! That efficiency gain sounds transformative for your productivity. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I think everyone thinks about that. I think that we've got the technology and it ain't going anywhere, so let's all jump on the bandwagon and put it to good use. No matter how good AI gets, it'll never cross over into sentience or gain the ability to be completely original, so creative thinkers will always be needed.

AI: That's a confident perspective on the future role of human creativity. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology continues to develop?

User: Absolutely, but I have no idea where it's going to take us. Right now I use it as a tool. In time I may give it more allowance to create.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while using AI as an efficiency tool, and how you've navigated the shift in your field from AI being denounced to becoming more acceptable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative thinking partner while maintaining creative ownership, and how you've adapted to changing industry attitudes, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
