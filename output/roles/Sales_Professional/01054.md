Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My most common use is ChatGPT 5's web search feature. My job requires I research a lot of facts in a short amount of time. At times, I get something tricky and my usual web search techniques lead me down either blind alleys or it's clear that getting to the information I need would take a lot of time (like reading through multiple page articles on NIH's website). In those instances, I will go to ChatGPT 5 and use a project I've set up on my account that directs it to give me extra information on a particular fact (or non-fact, if something I've found isn't founded in truth). The project instructions are set so that I don't have to waste time with things like "Can you fact check this for me?" Instead, I plug the sentence into the prompt field and it fact checks it for me. The project instructions also direct it to give me reference links for anything it claims (this is Chat's biggest pitfall -- sometimes the links lead to 404s).

Of course, I can't just take ChatGPT at its word. But it many times gives me an angle or a web link that I'd missed and makes my job a little easier. I use ChatGPT for this multiple times a day.

Of course, I also use it to word emails and such, but the main thing is just that fact checking help.

AI: That's a really efficient system you've set up with the project instructions. It sounds like you've tailored it specifically to streamline your research workflow.

When you mention that you "can't just take ChatGPT at its word" - could you walk me through what that verification process looks like for you? How do you decide what to double-check versus what you feel confident accepting?

User: I double-check everything because I have to. All the information I provide my employer has to be bulletproof. Which probably makes you ask: Why use ChatGPT at all? 

I use it because it can do what I would have to do otherwise, but within seconds or minutes. Say that I get a 404 for a particular reference link. It still has a good chance of leading me to a site where I CAN find the information I was looking for but that website hadn't come up in Google as an option or I just hadn't thought of going down that road. 

Unfortunately, being human, we get tired, don't see certain angles we might otherwise, or just completely miss something. ChatGPT is almost like a co-worker I turn to and say, "Hey, do you think I'm thinking of this the right way?" And then I get an answer that, may not be 100% there, but it can help me focus on details that get me there quicker instead of just searching blinding through the weeds.

AI: That's a fascinating way to think about it - ChatGPT as that colleague who offers a fresh perspective when you might be stuck in a particular search pattern.

I'm curious about those moments when you're deciding whether to turn to ChatGPT or continue with your traditional search methods. What's happening in those situations that makes you think, "Okay, this is a good time to bring in AI"?

User: I have to use Google a LOT. Let's say -- and I'm just making this up (as far as I know I've never had to research this in my time at my job) -- I have to search for all the versions of Kryptonite that have been used in the comics, books, movies, TV, etc. I could look that up on Google and the first twenty pages are movie reviews, random blogs where someone's yelling about their own theories about Kryptonite, and just stuff that is just off the wall (like I may get eBay links with people selling Kryptonite props). 

Now, in the past, I might have to slog through all this, but maybe I find a random blog that I can't really trust (because who knows who actually runs this blog) but there's a line on there that says, "Of the 24 different kinds of Kryptonite..." - Instead of taking that and going deeper, I go to ChatGPT, plug that sentence in and the way I have it set up, it will say, "Well, that's inaccurate. There's actually 22." And then it gives me some links that weren't in that first ten pages of google search results. 

So basically, I use it when I've hit a wall that I know will take me way longer than I want to use for a particular fact. I use it to narrow down time spent on a particular fact checking endeavor.

AI: That Kryptonite example really illustrates the challenge well - sifting through all that noise to get to reliable information.

When ChatGPT gives you that corrected number and those new links, what's your next step? Do you find yourself going back and forth between ChatGPT and your own searches, or is it more of a one-time consultation that sends you in the right direction?

User: A lot of times, for one fact checking endeavor, it's just a one time thing on that conversation. But occasionally, I may call it out for giving me a bum link and see if it can provide something better. Unfortunately, it usually doesn't. But sometimes it does. 

Occasionally, I may have to clarify something that doesn't make sense to me and ask a question about whatever topic I'm researching so I better understand it. But usually it's one and done.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as that quick consultation to break through when you're stuck, rather than an ongoing back-and-forth.

I'm curious about your preferences when it comes to different types of work tasks. You mentioned using AI for fact-checking and occasionally for wording emails. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle entirely yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Generally, no. AI has become so engrained in both my professional and work life, I don't have any issue trusting it with just about anything. Especially because I never just use AI and then send whatever I'm working on to the person or service that's getting it. I always double check stuff. Always.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you've developed this systematic approach where AI is integrated throughout your work, but always with that verification layer built in.

When you do use AI for something like wording emails, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it - going back and forth to refine the wording - or do you tend to give it the task and then just polish what it gives you?

User: Yeah. Almost everything is a collaboration. If it's an email that needs to be written, I give it scaffolding and then work back and forth with it to get what I want and then give it a polish after we're finished to make sure it didn't say anything I didn't want it to and to make sure it sounds humanized.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like a pretty refined workflow you've developed. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating different attitudes about AI tools?

User: I use AI more than anyone I know. A colleague recently said they hate AI and I just said nothing. I don't tell anyone my process because I know how a lot of people feel about AI. And it's not as if I'm not doing the work around my use of AI. It's just to make the job easier.

AI: That's a really telling dynamic - having to keep your workflow quiet despite it clearly helping you be more efficient.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI both satisfies and frustrates me. I'd say it satisfies more than frustrates because I can take a twenty minute job and whittle it down to a few minutes. It frustrates me when it obviously gets things wrong or I have to go back and redo the same prompt because it's forgotten my instructions. But usually, I'd say it satisfies more than frustrates.

AI: That balance makes sense - the time savings clearly outweigh the occasional hiccups.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Oh, every day of my life. LOL Right now, I'm using AI to help me identify places where I can remain relevant in an AI dominated world. 

Largely, however, in so many aspects, I see it as an asset if you know how to use it. Do I think it might make me obsolete at some point. Possibly. Maybe even certainly. But I feel like if I keep finding ways to have it teach me and ways to incorporate it, I'm ahead of the curve instead of behind it.

AI: That's such a pragmatic approach - using AI to help you figure out how to stay relevant in an AI world. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from where it is now?

User: I think, if anything, I'll use it more and more. Especially as the models become more advanced and are able to reason better.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on staying ahead of the curve by embracing AI rather than resisting it, and how you've developed this systematic approach of collaboration with verification.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope. This was a great interview. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research partner while maintaining that verification layer, and navigating workplace dynamics around AI use, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and challenges. Take care!
