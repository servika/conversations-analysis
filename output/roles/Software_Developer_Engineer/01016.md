Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Quick question is there a way for me to talk vocally or it has to be through text for this interview

AI: Great question! For this interview, we'll be communicating through text. I know it might feel a bit different from a typical spoken interview, but please feel free to respond as naturally and conversationally as you would if we were speaking face-to-face.

Don't worry about perfect grammar or formatting - just share your thoughts as they come to you. Sometimes people find that typing actually gives them a moment to reflect on their experiences, which can lead to really rich insights.

Are you comfortable proceeding with text, or do you have any other questions before we dive in?

User: yes let's proceed

AI: Perfect! Let's get started.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a software engineer, so primarily AI revolves around answering questions related to work. So a common one is to help me to write the code I need to for the work as a FullStack SWE. So I'll ask questions about an error I recieve, paste the results and ask AI to solve it. I'll paste ticket descripitoins while giving it context of my code and ask it to help produce something I can use there. I'll also ask it more general admin questions like working with issues on my computer, or how to handle something not code related specifically

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of tasks - from debugging code to handling general admin issues.

When you're working on these different types of tasks, how do you decide what to bring to AI versus what to tackle on your own? Are there certain coding problems or admin issues where you think "I'll figure this out myself" rather than asking AI for help?

User: I used to switch it up or only go for code things, but now for most things i like to a very quick "AI pass" where I'll go to AI right away, ask it what it thinks. If the answer works I'll go with it, but if it seems a bit off or confusing I'll do my own research and present any new info I find. So I want AI to ease the load of processing info for myself, but if it's off I'll go through my own google search and try to see what I find

AI: That "AI pass" approach is interesting - it sounds like you've developed a pretty efficient workflow where AI serves as your first filter for information processing.

I'm curious about those moments when AI's answer seems "a bit off or confusing" to you. Can you walk me through what that looks like? How do you typically recognize when the AI response isn't quite right, and what happens in your thought process at that point?

User: So a simple way to test is when it fails to work. So it gave me a solution but that didn't work. Or the option it told me to change in settings doesn't exist (cause it made it up) so I'll let it know it doesn't exist and try again a couple more times. I'm okay working with the AI and even correcting it's knowledge. Sometimes, it's first pass fails, but the second or third will work. But if it seems completely lost, I'll then move on. Another example is asking for a "simple solution" cause I'm open to quickly fixing some issue, but if it gives me something very complex, I'll move on or try to find something simpler from the model or on my own if I think it overcomplicated things naturally

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've really developed a good feel for when to persist with the AI versus when to move on. I like how you're willing to go back and forth with corrections.

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For instance, when you're working on a coding problem from a ticket, are you more likely to collaborate with AI throughout the whole process - like bouncing ideas back and forth - or do you tend to give it the full context and let it handle a complete solution independently?

User: It depends yeah. before I'd be more collaborative, but over time I've been pleasantly surprised by how much AI can do, that nowadays I'll let it give me a full solution independantly, and then I'll verify it with results. So most of the time now, if it's a big solution, I'll give it a descriptino of what I want, have some way to test it, then i'll check the code out to make sure it's fine. Sometimes I'll make manual edits, or i'll ask the AI to make specific edits I want cause the code isn't up to the standard I wanted (like bad formatting or weird logic)

AI: That evolution from collaborative to more delegative is really fascinating - it sounds like your trust in AI's capabilities has grown as you've worked with it more.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has particular attitudes or practices around AI that have shaped how you approach it?

User: They all are pretty Pro AI. I use cursor AI primaril ybecause a coworker recommended it and recommended trying to lean on it more. Which made me realize it was worth giving heavier workloads

AI: That's great that you have that supportive environment. It sounds like having colleagues who are also embracing AI has really accelerated your own adoption.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A satisfying and frustrating example is when I asked it to develop a pretty complicated solution for a downloading images button I need to incorporate. It worked alright but then there were some minor issues in the solution popping up. It got a good gist and created a ton of good boilerplate, but then was failing more specific edits and was going round and round. It took a while before I got to the right solution. It felt like I need to reset contexts, try all over or make sure to use what was working, but then go from there. Version control is key with AI. Storing a working solution cause it's so finicky, it could break everything in a new small iteration

AI: That's a really insightful example - it highlights both the power and the pitfalls of working with AI. The version control strategy you mention sounds crucial.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it factor into how you decide what to delegate versus what to handle yourself?

User: I struggle with this personally yeah. I'm unsure how to approach it precisely. I want to upskill in ways I enjoy, but I'm unclear in how to become better "versed" in AI that I'm still valuable. A big thing definitlye is becomeing more aware of what AI tools can use to boost productivity to where I'm ahead of people who don't use it as much. Ultimately, if i can guide AI better than others, it's a win. So it's something I actively wanna think about more. Like taking a longer time to construct a proper prompt instead of just jumping in randomly

AI: That tension you're describing - wanting to stay valuable while also leveraging AI effectively - sounds like something a lot of people are grappling with. The idea of becoming better at guiding AI as a competitive advantage is really thoughtful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this all heading for you personally?

User: There's no avoiding it. I'll be using AI for work no matter what. and likely there will be people recommending or pushing me to use it more if time constraints kick in. It's possible simply that the expectation of output will only grow as AI gets bigger and better at this stuff

AI: That's a really candid perspective - the idea that expectations might scale up along with AI capabilities is something I haven't heard put quite that way before.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your "AI pass" workflow and how you've evolved from collaborative to more delegative approaches as your trust has grown.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope that's all I have thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about evolving from collaborative to delegative approaches, the importance of version control when working with AI, and that thoughtful perspective on how output expectations might scale with AI capabilities - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your workflow and thought process. Have a great rest of your day!
