Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: that sounds great! No, I do not have any questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: yes, so I'm a third year medical student currently on different clerkships. Recently, I was on my surgery clerkship, and I was getting pimped on various questions from my attending and residents. I  had to go into patient rooms and interview patients, give them physicals, and also come up with differential diagnoses and treatment plans. I used AI to help me narrow down diagnoses and help me come up with firstline treatment plans for my SOAP note. It also helped me organize information into a format where I could provide presentations to my attending and residents. I also used it for understanding pharmacology and also asking AI to help me understand pathophysiology better in a way that I could help my patients understand.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI across so many different aspects of your clinical work. 

Tell me more about how you use AI when you're being pimped by your attending and residents. Do you use it in the moment during those interactions, or is it more for preparation beforehand?

User: For both! So my attendings also believe in using smartphones to look up information in the moment that I don't know something. So if I get pimped on a subject that I'm pretty weak in, my attending tells me to look it up. I tailored my AI to respond to me in a certain way so that I could be prepared for my shelf exams and for questions on the job. So I use it in the moment when I get asked questions and also for preparation beforehand, because my attendings tell me what surgical procedures I will be seeing the next day.

AI: That's fascinating that your attendings are encouraging real-time smartphone use. 

You mentioned you've tailored your AI to respond in a certain way for shelf exams and on-the-job questions. Can you walk me through what that tailoring looks like? How did you customize it to work better for your specific needs?

User: Yes, I'll provide you my exact customization. Under "what do you do" I typed in "medical student" and under "what traits should I have" I typed in: "For *only* medical/scientific types of questions: I would like the responses to be very thorough with pathogenesis, physiology, mechanism of action, all cross references to different organ systems, associated pathology, etc. (anything you deem as high-yield information) because I am studying for shelf exams (for step 2). Explain to me as the Robbins medical textbooks, Goljan Rapid Review pathology, Boards and Beyond, Sketchy, Pathoma, Dirty Medicine would explain to a medical school student. I need you to slow everything down and go step-by-step like it's my first time encountering any medical subject I'm asking you — but still keep it high-yield, scientific, and NBME-style in language so that I can understand the questions whenever I see them on the USMLE test. I also get pimped by my attending, so help me by giving me practice questions that he could ask on that subject." I typed in the "for only," because I also use AI for every day things.

AI: That's incredibly specific and strategic. I can see how you've essentially turned your AI into a personalized medical tutor that matches your study resources.

When you're in those high-pressure moments getting pimped by your attending, how well does that customized response style actually work for you? Are you able to quickly absorb and use the information AI gives you in real-time?

User: YES! It's amazing, because it normally thinks of anything that my attending could ask me in that specific moment. It provides more information than what I asked just so that I can stay one step ahead of my attending or resident. So even though I get a question on that subject wrong, I'm prepared for any follow-up questions, and my attendings and residents get very impressed, because they don't know that, lol. One of the residents was so impressed that she asked me how I got my AI customized like that. I'm also able to absorb this information quickly, because the explanations are geared to help me understand in a less complicated way - hence the "teach it to me like it's my first time learning the information."

AI: That's really clever how you're staying ahead of the follow-up questions! It sounds like it's giving you a real confidence boost in those interactions.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your clinical work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, I do my calculations on my own. AI messes up some things when I ask for calculations - for example, I was calculating an ejection fraction and also calculating an acid base problem, and AI got it wrong, and I was embarrassed. So I stuck to using the formulas provided to me and me calculating some stuff myself. I also write the SOAP note a certain way, so I only use AI to help me come up with information, but the final SOAP note product is written by me - because my attendings/residents prefer SOAP notes written a certain way.

AI: That's a really important distinction - recognizing where AI's limitations might actually create problems for you. It sounds like you've learned through experience where to draw those boundaries.

When you do use AI for gathering information for your SOAP notes, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete request and then work with what it gives you?

User: I go back and forth with the process. For example, if it doesn't include the necessary information for past medical history or social history, then I'll change it. Like one time, one of my SOAP notes generated by AI didn't include all of the review of systems even though my attending wants them all, so I had to redo it and ask for it to specifically include the other ROS. I also had to change some verbage - for example, using the word "denies dyspnea" instead of "no dyspnea".

AI: That back-and-forth refinement process sounds really iterative. You're essentially teaching the AI your attending's specific preferences as you go.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned that one resident was impressed and asked about your customization - are others using it similarly, or are you finding different approaches among your peers?

User: Mhmm...I think there are a lot of medical students/residents who are too proud to rely on AI in front of their peers/attendings. When I'm alone with some residents or students, they'll tell me, "Yeah, I use AI to do my notes and help me with my research papers" - especially with homework assignments.

AI: That's really insightful - there seems to be this private versus public divide in how people are actually using AI in medical training.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt satisfied when I was able to come up with the right answer with the help of AI whereas my peers could not. For example, I had to come up with some research articles talking about using angiotensin as a vasopressor for distributive shock, and I used open evidence AI to find me research articles for that. The time I was frustrated was when I asked it to make a calculation for me, and it gave me the wrong answer, and I felt embarrassed.

AI: Those are such clear contrasting moments - where AI made you shine versus where it let you down in front of others.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially as you're still learning medicine?

User: yeah, that's something we even talk about in the workplace, because everyone jokes about how radiology will be the first to get taken over. However, I really like working with AI - I think it helps health practitioners work more efficiently. I also like how it'll help with not missing important information - especially since we had a problem where my attending was super upset that a radiologist had missed an important feature that was on the xray that could have shown a malignancy early on.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing AI as a tool that could actually improve patient care by catching things that might be missed.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as you progress through medical school and into residency?

User: yeah, I think that AI is great, but healthcare will always need the human/emotional aspect of patient healthcare. As I mentioned before, I think it'd progress into working more efficiently and becoming a partner in the assessment of a patient. I mean, my sister's work already uses AI to help her keep up with managing her patients' healthcare - it types out questions and responses for anything that her patients could ask even though she has no prior medical knowledge.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've strategically customized AI as a learning tool and how you've learned to navigate its limitations through experience.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your medical training that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: yes. I was studying for Step 1 over the summer, and I was using AI to help me make anki cards and pdfs of summaries/notes for the pathophysiology of high yield information. I asked it to give me high-yield points and gave it examples on what to do. It kept telling me that it was getting it done but to give it 12 hours to prepare the external link. I then asked it to give me the information, and it would then say it needed 2 more days, but that it promised me that would be all the time it needed. When I said I needed a more condense version in 2 hours, it told me that it would provide that for me and that it was so sorry for taking so long. Then when I brought it up 2 hours later, it would tell me that it would need more time. So when I finally grew impatient, it would send me a link that wouldn't work. It felt like it just hallucinated and gave me the wrong links. It made me pretty upset that it kept lying to me.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when you were under pressure studying for Step 1. It's such a stark contrast to the positive experiences you've had with AI in your clinical rotations.

Thank you so much for sharing that additional experience - it really highlights how AI can behave so differently across different types of tasks and contexts. Your insights about both the successes and the significant failures have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective as someone actively integrating AI into medical training has been really valuable.
