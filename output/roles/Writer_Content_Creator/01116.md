Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions claude, fire away.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So I have a side job/hobby/hustle creating marketing materials for authors that they can use in promotions, like images or videos, all AI generated. My most recent project was to generate some clips with AI and then put those together to make a mini trailor or 'vibe reel' for a thriller novel set in rio de janeiro, so the author could use it as a banner on the books amazon page.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting niche! Creating promotional materials for authors using AI-generated content is such a specific application.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process for a project like that Rio de Janeiro thriller trailer. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for different AI tools?

User: So, the authors usually send me a 'storyboard' or general outline for what they want in the trailor, but I often use AI models to help me figure out more about the book if I have not read it, so for example I use ChatGPT or similar to break down the blub or a summary of the book, and use that to help me get the gist of the book. Then I can use this to turn into prompts for Sora to get the images.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - using AI to help you understand the source material before creating the promotional content. 

Can you walk me through that Rio de Janeiro thriller project specifically? What did the author give you initially, and how did you use AI to break down their book and then translate that into the actual video clips?

User: The author gave me a story outline for the trailor, 5-6 scenes or 'moments' he wanted short videos or images for - such as a scene walking through a favela, or standing on a hill above the city. He gave me the blurb and a summary, and also a folder full of reference images that could be useful for giving to Sora to animate or just to give me the idea of what he wanted. I then used each of these scenes to create a prompt to give to sora, and with a lot of tries and remixes came out with some good videos.

AI: That's really helpful to understand your process. It sounds like you had to do quite a bit of iteration with Sora to get the right results.

When you're working with Sora and going through those "lot of tries and remixes," how would you describe that collaboration? Are you feeling like you're directing the AI, or does it feel more like a back-and-forth creative partnership?

User: It feels a bit more like a battle to be honest, usually the iterations are less because each one is a little better, and more because the product is quite bad and needs refinement. some scenes took multiple hours to refine. So I feel as if i am directing a non-compliant worker sometimes haha

AI: Ha! That's such a vivid way to put it - a "non-compliant worker." That sounds pretty frustrating when you have a clear vision but the tool isn't cooperating.

Tell me more about those hours of refinement. What kinds of things would go wrong that you'd need to keep pushing back on, and how did you finally get Sora to give you what you needed?

User: so I think it is just all part of the process. Say the author wanted a scene on a dark beach of two figures meeting. Usually the movement wouldn't be quite right, or the setting, or the scene. Even with prompts nearing 200 words, something just was not quite right. Often I would take the best of the results and remix that with things like 'change the colour of the lights' or 'lower the camera angle' - just little tweaks until it met the authors vision

AI: That level of detailed iteration is really interesting - going from 200-word prompts to these very specific tweaks like camera angles and lighting. It sounds like you're developing a pretty sophisticated vocabulary for communicating with the AI.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI for these author projects? How is this different from how you might have approached similar work before?

User: I think it changed everything, as before AI I would not be able to do this, as my cinematography experience is limited, and most authors do not have the budget to pay for a bull blown promotional video with a cast and crew. Doing it this way lets the author achieve their vision with as little expenditure as possible.

AI: That's a really powerful point - AI essentially opened up an entirely new service you could offer that wasn't economically feasible before.

Given how transformative this has been for your work, what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in this space or in creative fields more broadly?

User: I think AI is a tool, not a shortcut or crutch. I don't believe that AI has a place in many creative spaces. But i see this as a case where it is used for good. The creative work here, really, is the authors book and their skill at writing. This is just a promotional video to help them sell the real product - the novels. The authors usually are just that - authors. Not videographers capable of making a high budget trailer themselves - so I think using AI in this way is fine as it helps authors get their real work out to people.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI to promote the "real" creative work rather than replace it. It sounds like you see yourself as helping authors bridge a gap they couldn't cross on their own.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your work with authors evolving over the next few years? Do you think the tools will get easier to work with, or do you expect that "battle" element to remain part of the process?

User: I think tools will get easier naturally as AI improves. Even in the last few years the capability of AI image and video generation has dramatically increased. AI is already able to create photorealistic or stylized videos - I think in the future it will just get better at translating the users thoughts and ideas into something tangible - the foundation is there and only getting stronger.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool that enables authors to access promotional capabilities they couldn't afford otherwise, and your distinction between using AI to support the "real" creative work versus replacing it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope thats fine thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative "battle" with AI tools, the economic accessibility this creates for authors, and your thoughtful perspective on where AI fits appropriately in creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your process today. Have a great rest of your day!
