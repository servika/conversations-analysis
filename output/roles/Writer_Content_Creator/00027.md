Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! As a note, I am a very dedicated hobbyist writer and artist, and do not actually work for any particular company. I have been creating all my life. The qualification said that was acceptable, so I just want to specify!

AI: That's perfect! Thank you for clarifying - dedicated hobbyist creators absolutely bring valuable perspectives to this research. In many ways, your experience might be even more interesting since you're choosing to integrate AI purely based on your own creative goals rather than any external requirements.

So to get us started - could you tell me a bit about your creative work? What kind of writing and art do you create, and what does a typical project look like for you?

User: On a personal level, I am an artist that works with many different mediums! I use pencil, pen, oil paint, OPEN acrylics (slow drying), etc. I also draw digitally. When I create personal pieces, I enjoy a spontaneous direction with my work. Collaboratively with my partner, we write a fantasy alien story together! We have been working on it for over five years. We eventually want to make it a comic, and explore many other mediums to express our story as well. Mythological and queer themes are also present and integrated into our project.

AI: That sounds like such a rich and varied creative practice! I love that you're working across so many different mediums and have this long-term collaborative project with your partner. Five years is quite a journey for a story.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools across your different artistic mediums and your writing work?

User: For visual art, I like to use AI for very loose conceptual ideas (such as color palettes), material research (used AI to help identify a vintage flake white oil paint the other week), and artform exploration (such as learning about obscure cultural techniques that are difficult to learn about). For writing, I use AI for very basic ideas such as learning about specific topics I want to write about but do not know how to structure (such as military power structures), looking for mythology to research, basic character concepts (such as animals to take inspiration from for character ideas), etc. With writing in particular, I like specific ideas to be anonymous when talking to an assistant for idea and concept security.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI more as a research assistant and creative catalyst rather than having it directly create content for you. I'm particularly intrigued by your approach to maintaining anonymity around your specific ideas for concept security.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you were working through that creative process?

User: My partner and I recently used AI for one of our characters. He takes a lot of inspiration from amphibians and reptiles, but recently we discovered a popular character who looks crocodilian, which was quite similar to some of our concepts. We had to go back to the drawing board because we do not want our characters to be compared like that (design-wise), and so we discussed mythology ideas and animal ideas in order to get inspiration.

AI: Tell me more about that process - when you were working through that challenge with your partner and using AI to explore new directions, how did it feel to navigate that shift? And how did you approach the conversation with AI to get the kind of inspiration you were looking for while keeping your specific character details protected?

User: It felt nice to get some more ideas, and it allowed us to discuss many of the suggestions on our own! We did not directly specify which ideas we liked to the assistant, so it doesn't know whether we liked or disliked a suggestion for our particular character.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using the AI suggestions as a springboard for your own private discussions. When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: The collaboration overall is quite useful--when ideas are in jeopardy, it feels stressful, and AI takes a lot of confusion out of potential research directions for our creative processes and ideas. We like to let the assistant throw things at the wall and only give necessary direction for it to give relevant suggestions, as we independently enjoy refining and drafting our own finalized concepts or ideas.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as this broad generator while you maintain control over the refinement and final decisions. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has it shifted how you approach certain parts of your process, or opened up new possibilities you didn't have before?

User: Ease of researching, for sure! I love to do research and so does my partner, but especially with obscure mythology/folklore (for example) you sometimes have to go a long approach to even know certain concepts or figures exist, as you can't just start researching what you aren't aware of. Asking about particular deities or concepts that fit certain ideas in different regions is a lot easier to do and refine with AI vs asking roundabout questions on Google until you know what to look for. Stuff similar to that is a great use for AI, and allows us to focus our research and save time.

AI: That's such a great point about the discovery problem in research - you can't Google what you don't know exists! It sounds like AI has really opened up that initial exploration phase for you.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your creative fields - whether that's visual art, writing, or the broader creative landscape?

User: Ethics. I work with AI so I have a bit of a unique perspective, but so many artists are terrified right now because of their works getting scraped and losing value--this fear is very observable in digital visual artists. I work on a more offline-level creatively so I have less fear, but I feel bad for people who are losing work.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - having that insider understanding of AI while also seeing the real impact on fellow creators. It sounds like your more offline approach gives you some insulation from those concerns.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your own creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate using it differently, or in new ways as the technology develops?

User: I plan to use it similarly! I am wary about what I tell the models in order to avoid accidentally training it personal/unique ideas, but I think I have a good sense of keeping that personal space and AI is very helpful for research and providing pools of basic concepts or ways to experiment.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that boundary between AI-generated suggestions and your own private creative development with your partner, and how you've found AI so valuable for that initial discovery phase of research.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thank you, that's about it! My final remark is that, while definitely not as big as a hobby, AI gives really great and fun suggestions for original home building ideas in Sims! I use it very directly for that all the time, and it's very fun and stress-free because I don't really care about those ideas as much. It gives great suggestions on types of homes or spaces I can build and what kinds of rooms I can make and what kinds of furniture I can use. I might use AI for building ideas in my story in the future, because I feel like that can be low-stress!

AI: That's such a delightful example! I love how you've found this completely stress-free application where you can just play and experiment without any of the creative ownership concerns. And it's interesting how that might bridge into your story work for architectural elements - that seems like a natural extension where you could maintain your boundaries while still getting those fun, exploratory ideas.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency while leveraging AI as a research tool, and how you navigate the balance between collaboration and protection of your unique ideas, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your thoughtfulness throughout this conversation!
