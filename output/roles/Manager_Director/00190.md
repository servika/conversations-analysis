Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not have any questions. Feel free to start.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a chef, I sometimes use AI chatbots to help me organize menus and answer questions about dishes/ingredients

AI: That's interesting - using AI for menu organization and ingredient questions. Can you walk me through what that actually looks like in practice? Like, when you're organizing menus, what specific things are you asking AI to help you with?

User: Let's say I was required to make an Italian cuisine themed menu. In this case, I would use AI to research Italian dishes and the necessary ingredients to make them. Once I have a good idea of what I want to include on the menu, I would give the model all of the necessary information and try to get the AI model to format the menu in the way I like. This would usually include bold text, italics, and spacing, where necessary, and listing the ingredients after the title of the dish. Typically, this formatting will also include the name of the restaurant and other details that need to be at the beginning and end of the menu, such as allergen information.

AI: That's a really detailed process. When you're doing that research phase - learning about Italian dishes and ingredients - how do you decide what information to trust from the AI? Do you find yourself double-checking things, or do you generally feel confident in what it tells you about dishes and ingredients?

User: I always double-check the information provided by the AI. The AI gives me a framework, and I go back to make sure all details are correct. It would be embarassing to put out a menu that does not include the correct ingredients, for example. It would be much worse if an allergen was not properly labeled, so I always find myself doing my own research to supplement the AI's response.

AI: That makes complete sense - the stakes are really high when it comes to allergen information and accuracy. You mentioned that AI gives you a framework that you then verify. Are there certain types of cooking tasks or decisions that you prefer to keep entirely to yourself, even when AI could potentially help? What makes those different for you?

User: I would not rely on the AI to make the menu from scratch, or to help me with ordering food. The AI might do a decent job at producing a menu, but it also may fail to consider the specifics of the expected clients (With allergens, general taste, and menu balance).  I wouldn't ask the AI to help me with tasks related to ordering food because there is no way for the model to know all of the price points, unless I told them. I would have to inform the AI on too much data for it to help me with ordering, so it is easier to do it myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - you're pointing out that AI lacks the contextual knowledge about your specific clients and current supplier pricing. When you are working with AI on those menu formatting tasks, how does that interaction typically unfold? Are you going back and forth with it making adjustments, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it handle the formatting independently?

User: I typically give the AI an outline with all of the menu items and formatting options I need. In my experience, I might have to restate some aspects that the AI did not deliver on, like a specific formatting detail. Usually, it does well, but I have to add those details to the document on my own.

AI: So it sounds like you're mostly delegating the bulk formatting to the AI, then making those final tweaks yourself. You mentioned that your colleagues or workplace culture might influence how you use AI - how has that played out in your experience as a chef? Do other people in your kitchen or restaurant use AI tools, or is this something you've adopted on your own?

User: I adopted AI use on my own, but it could be useful to some of my coworkers. The cooks, dishwashers, and general staff really wouldn't need AI to complete their tasks because all problem-solving solutions are laid out in front of them. I don't know of another coworker that uses AI. Other managers could certainly use it, especially for document and spreadsheet organization.

AI: It sounds like you've been something of a pioneer in bringing AI into your workplace. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A few months ago, I had to put up a prix fixe menu with an Argentinian style. I was completely unfamiliar with the cuisine, but the AI really helped me out. It helped me step-by-step to learn about different Argentinian style dishes, and even which ones would fit with my menu. I ended up making Argentinian barbecue, all thanks to the AI's suggestion, which was probably my most successful use of AI to make a menu.

AI: That sounds like a really successful collaboration - especially tackling a completely unfamiliar cuisine. From that experience and others, how do you think about maintaining your own culinary skills and knowledge in areas where AI could potentially help? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I always consider this as I cook and learn. I often use the AI to sharpen up the kitchen skills that I already know, just so I can confirm that I am doing a task in the most efficient way.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different tasks as you get more comfortable with it?

User: I'm hoping that AI will soon be able to take in every factor necessary to make a menu, even when it is complicated by the food requirements of a specific culture, allergies, and likely preference of the clients. These are common in my experience, but I have not had a flawless answer from an AI when making a menu and including these stipulations. Still, I'm certain it eventually will. Though, I don't think the AI will develop enough to handle food ordering beyond organization.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a framework that you then verify and refine - that seems like such a practical approach for high-stakes work like yours.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I have pretty much covered my AI usage at work, so I don't have anything to add.

AI: Perfect, thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you use AI as a research and formatting tool while maintaining your own expertise and judgment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes - like that Argentinian menu - and the limitations you've encountered. It's been a pleasure speaking with you today.
