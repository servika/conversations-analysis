Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I've just started a new job so I use it for lots of things, I have to do a bunch of training about quite technical things, so I will use AI to help explain and break down some of the things I don't understand. My new job also uses git and gitlab, which i don't have much experience in, so I use AI to get the commands I need or help with any issues with git. I also use it to explain any terminology or acronyms that my company uses

AI: That sounds like AI is really helping you navigate the learning curve at your new position. When you're using AI to explain those technical concepts or help with git commands, how do you typically go about it? 

Do you find yourself asking for a quick explanation and moving on, or do you tend to have longer back-and-forth conversations to really dig into understanding something?

User: I normally just ask a quick question and use the reply, if I still have an issue I then sometimes have a bit longer conversation, but normally not too long

AI: That makes sense - getting what you need efficiently. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If it's a basic coding problem I will normally try and figure it out myself so that I can learn better rather than just getting it all done for me

AI: That's interesting - you're being intentional about preserving your own learning opportunities. 

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For example, with those git commands or technical explanations - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask it to handle something completely and then take that output and run with it?

User: I normally just ask it a basic question about what I'm doing and try to do the rest myself, if I can't I will then ask AI to do more

AI: So you're starting with targeted questions and only escalating if you need to - that's a thoughtful approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or practices around AI use at your new company?

User: My company is pushing for AI to be used in the workplace, so I feel more comfortable using it fpr lots of questions

AI: That's helpful context - having that organizational support seems to make a difference for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had to create a webpage with some javascript that would interact with something to use some SQL,  I used Ai to do both the Javascript and the SQL and finished that part of the site very quickly, which was nice

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying experience - getting through both the JavaScript and SQL efficiently. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially as you're learning in your new role?

User: I think about it a lot, I will try to solve problems myself if I have the time or it is not very complicated, so I can learn or maintain my skills

AI: That balance between efficiency and skill-building sounds like something you're actively managing. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your approach might change as you get more settled in your role?

User: I think I will be able to do the simple things by myself a lot better, especially things like git commands and simple SQL functions. So I will mainly use AI for more complicated things or writing any documentation I will need to write

AI: That makes a lot of sense - moving from using AI for basics now to focusing it on more complex tasks as your foundational skills develop.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being intentional about when to use AI versus doing things yourself to preserve learning opportunities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I use it quite often to make my emails sound better, either more proffesional or more friendly depending on the context

AI: That's a great addition - using AI to help with tone and communication style is something I hadn't asked about but sounds really valuable, especially when you're navigating relationships in a new workplace.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with learning, and how organizational culture affects AI comfort levels, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
