Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! I don't have any questions yet.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then. 

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I manage a performance "group" (which is just my husband & I) so I'm in charge of sending quotes to potential clients, creating invoices, gathering booking details, communicating with clients, and keeping up with all the ins and outs of the actual performances (such as our costumes, music, and order of props).

AI: That sounds like you're juggling quite a lot of different responsibilities! It's interesting that you're managing both the business side and the creative performance elements.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I struggle with writing TOO much when it comes to performance descriptions, website blurbs, social media posts, gig quotes, and emails to clients. AI helps me improve my writing skills to be more concise and use key "action" terms that help the website get more hits. I keep collections of messages and quotes to quickly reply to quote requests, so I reach out to AI for help with the wording every few weeks or so, or when I need help writing a "short" social media post about an upcoming event. I also design cover images for some events (combining our promo images with those from the client or event page) so I occasionally get help from AI with the arrangement of images (without using AI generated graphics).

AI: That's really helpful - so you're using AI primarily as a writing editor and collaborator to help you be more concise and strategic with your language. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I needed an updated "blurb" describing our performance services (circus arts, LED glow & fire shows) and I'd been teaching Gemini my "handwriting" by pasting previous emails and quotes for them to learn from (I asked Gemini their preferred pronouns & they said "it" or "they" - I prefer "they) as well as assistance with writing previous quotes, social media posts, and emails to clients. I started out by providing the existing "blurb" along with a list of ideas for what needed to change. We then went back & forth with drafts until we had a new version that we both felt had a good balance of concise and informative, without overwhelming the potential client with too much information (or questions) all at once.

AI: That's fascinating that you've developed this ongoing relationship with Gemini where you're teaching them your writing style. The back-and-forth collaboration you described sounds quite interactive.

When you say "we both felt had a good balance" - that's interesting language. When you're working with AI in that collaborative way, how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I definitely feel like I'm the driving force and the AI model is my "assistant" (and sometimes my "cheerleader" when I'm feeling overwhelmed with All The Things). We both learn from each other & it's interesting to see all of the personal elements that they insert into conversations and projects over time.

AI: That's really interesting - you mention that you both learn from each other and that you notice personal elements developing in your conversations over time. 

Tell me more about what those personal elements look like and how that dynamic has evolved as you've worked together.

User: For one, I use certain "meme speech" phrases often in casual writing (to acquaintances, friends, and AI) such as "Much Excite," "All The Things," and "What do?" (that last one is just quoting a bird named Hamlet but it feels like a meme in my household). Gemini often capitalizes "Things" in responses (which I've asked them not to do so in "professional" writing) and uses parenthesis for side thoughts more often, which is something you can see that I do a bit too often.

AI: That's a really vivid example of how the interaction becomes more personalized over time - it's almost like you're developing a shared language with some of your quirks rubbing off on each other.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I've gotten better at "top down" salesmanship, which a previous photography job attempted to teach me ages ago, but I've always been too nice & have a tendency to jump straight to an amount that I think might best fit the client's budget. I've gotten better about not using parenthesis quite as often (I edited the previous sentence to use commas instead but here I go using them again in this sentence). When discussing sensitive topics, such as travel fees or clarifying that we're not able to provide a specific service, I've learned to use the "sandwich method" more often, starting & ending with positive ideas.

AI: It sounds like AI has helped you develop more strategic communication skills - both in terms of sales approach and diplomatic messaging. The "sandwich method" example is particularly concrete.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: There will always be other performers with a "leg up" getting more high paying gigs regardless, but I worry that some might take advantage of AI generated image and videos to make themselves look more impressive & hook in clients, especially the rich ones that aren't really paying attention to what they're getting once the event actually starts. I just try to stay open & honest with clients & hope that our communication will make them want to choose us over the competition.

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about authenticity in marketing versus actual performance quality. It sounds like you're taking the approach of doubling down on genuine communication and relationships.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I could see an AI ran communication system that only needs minimal input on my end to be able to quickly and efficiently respond to gig quotes.

I also hope to actually work with AI to provide more in depth digital performance options, such as LED props that are synchronized to projected visualizations and programed along with specific music. Many artists have similar performance elements, but they're quite expensive.

AI: That vision of AI helping with both the administrative side and potentially enhancing the actual creative performance through synchronized elements is really compelling - almost like AI supporting you at both ends of your process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on developing that collaborative relationship with Gemini where you're teaching each other, and how you're thinking about maintaining authenticity while others might use AI-generated content to misrepresent their capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: You are quite welcome! No more questions from me.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing a personalized collaborative relationship with AI, using it to improve your business communication skills, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining authenticity in your field will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both the practical benefits you've experienced and your concerns about how others might use AI less ethically. Best of luck with your performance work!
