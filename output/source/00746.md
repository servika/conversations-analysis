Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI as a brainstorming tool, when ideating content, normally to break through the writers block. If the piece of content is long-form, I might use writing tools for proofreading, and providing basic structure before editing it with my own flair. At the beginning of a campaign I use AI to assist with planning, particularly if it requires a lot of content, such as a multichannel launch campaign.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI plays several different roles for you throughout your creative process. 

When you mention using AI for brainstorming to break through writer's block, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically interact with AI in those moments?

User: I tend to use ChatGPT or Perplexity if the content is more complex. I write a couple of blogs a week about Billboard advertising so it requires some research into the different industries we cater for. 

Normally I have an idea for the topic of a blog, something like "I want to write about how clients can measure the success of their billboard campaign - can you give me a brief outline about topics to include?".

Then through some iteration, I'll see the suggestions ChatGPT makes, sometimes it's easier having "someone" to bounce ideas off of. With the back and forth, I'll start adding more context because the AI-written content can come out quite generic or stiff.

If the idea is already fully-formed in my mind, I'll do a rough draft, and ask ChatGPT to proofread and correct any errors, or condense the text to make it more concise.

If I'm really stuck, Perplexity helps with research on Billboard or industry statistics to make the blog more robust and rich with insights.

AI: That back-and-forth process you describe is fascinating - using AI almost like a thinking partner to develop your ideas. 

You mentioned that AI-written content can come out "quite generic or stiff," and that you add your own context and flair. Tell me more about that - what does it look like when you're adding that personal touch to make the content distinctly yours?

User: The tone-of-voice we try and use is more "business casual", because the audience reading is normally a business owner (probably a SERP too), so the sentences need to feel like they flow and read easily. At times, AI-Written content can feel "clunky". For the purpose of the content I've written, I prefer to add my own flair, and make it sound "personal", rather than train the AI to write in my tone of voice, but I might consider that in the future if the content writing tasks become more demanding.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that personal, conversational tone for your business audience. 

I'm curious about your choice to add your own flair rather than training the AI to match your voice. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks feel different to you?

User: It's more about the likelihood of it being seen by a person. Also, our other responsibilities might mean we can't spend as much time refining our written content, then I might lean some more on AI. 

Personally, I enjoy writing content so I spend more time on the blogs, but some colleagues of mine who specialise in design or sales, lean more heavily on AI written content.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - the visibility and your personal enjoyment of the writing process both playing a role in how much you rely on AI.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you're collaborating with it throughout the process rather than just handing off complete tasks. Is that accurate, or does it vary depending on what you're working on?

User: It might vary, because social media posts, sales emails, blogs and newsletters have different requirements. 

When I'm writing blogs and newsletters, the tool is handy throughout, whether I'm brainstorming, doing research to provide insights, or proofreading for errors at the end. 

For short-form content, it's only really for brainstorming.

AI: That variation based on content type is really insightful - it sounds like the complexity and length of the content influences how much you collaborate with AI throughout the process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned that colleagues in design or sales lean more heavily on AI-written content.

User: In a commercial setting, where the bottom line is what matters, I have used AI more than I did initially. Sometimes we have deadlines to meet. But I'm better at training AI than they are, so that's where they're influenced by me.

AI: That's really interesting - so there's this balance between commercial pressures pushing you toward more AI use, while your expertise in working with AI makes you a resource for your colleagues.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied: We were launching a campaign for a Billboard summer sale, which was being launched on all channels (Social, Email, Web, Billboard). So I asked ChatGPT to assist in creating a content plan. It produced a very comprehensive plan, with the effective dates. Then it was a case of delegating to team members. I was still able to retain the creative responsibilities of writing and even ideating specific content pieces, but the tedious part of planning was helped by the AI. 

Frustrated: I asked the model to help with Keyword research to optimise some old blogs we had on the website, and providing keywords that would help us rank better. I found that the AI's suggestions were quite "low-hanging fruit", when I wanted more long-tail keywords to optimise the content with. Ultimately, I found that it was quicker to do it myself.

AI: Those are great examples - it really highlights how AI excels at some tasks but falls short on others. The campaign planning success versus the keyword research frustration shows such a clear contrast.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: All the time, although I consider myself to be a competent copywriter, more senior decision makers might not see it as necessary. So I'm upskilling in data and technical skills like SEO, and trying to leverage my AI-training skills so if I become a content manager, I can still write content but AI will assist in the volume.

AI: That's such a strategic approach - positioning yourself where AI enhances rather than replaces your expertise. The way you're thinking about becoming more of a content manager who can leverage AI for volume while maintaining the creative oversight is really thoughtful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm sure as AI evolves in the realm of data and marketing analytics, I'll likely be using tools that assist with SEO and Marketing Campaign Analytics management. I am noticing that B2C social media content is returning to more "rough" formats, as the polished videos don't seem to resonate so much with followers. B2B is a different story, but even LinkedIn boosts posts with more human interaction.

AI: That's a really astute observation about content trends - how audiences are gravitating toward more authentic, "rough" content over polished AI-generated material. It sounds like you're seeing AI's role potentially shifting more toward the analytical side while human authenticity becomes even more valuable for audience connection.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you strategically balance AI assistance with maintaining your personal voice and creative control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's it for now. Thanks for listening!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the strategic balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while preserving human authenticity and creative control will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you navigate everything from brainstorming to campaign planning, and how you're thinking ahead about skill development in an AI-integrated workplace.

Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
