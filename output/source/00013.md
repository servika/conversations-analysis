Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm ready!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work has a couple of main branches that sometimes overlap: Visual art (drawing, painting) and filmmaking/video content (handmade stop motion films, animation, interviews).

My visual art projects typically involve doing commission work and designing/selling merchandise such as t-shirts. I also create concept art and assets for my film/video work.

My filmmaking/video projects include pre-production (concepts, planning, writing), production (building physical props, puppetry, lighting and filming scenes), and post-production (editing, sound design, visual effects).

Both of these main branches require promotion and marketing, which involves writing copy, voiceover work, and engagement with fans and followers.

AI: That's fascinating - you have such a diverse creative practice spanning both traditional visual arts and filmmaking. It sounds like you're working across the full spectrum from very hands-on physical creation to digital post-production.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Typically it's at the beginning and finishing stages of a project. For example, for visual art I might use AI to help me brainstorm rough concepts or generate reference materials such as model poses or background elements. For filmmaking, AI can be used for spitballing ideas or doing some basic concept art to get the ball rolling. Films and video content also require plenty of post-production work, and AI can help with the process of, for example, compositing characters into a scene or rendering virtual environments and lighting.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI seems to serve as both a creative catalyst at the beginning and a technical assistant towards the end. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: My filmmaking team recently discovered a tool for virtual environments that allows the user to use dynamic lighting within a virtual scene. This allows us to light a subject (character) using flat lighting in front of a green screen, key them out, and use the virtual lighting to light according to the environment we've built in Blender.. For a two-person team it's been a huge step toward creating scenes without having to pre-plan every single lighting setup, which keeps us from getting bogged down in the more technical aspects.

AI: That sounds like a game-changer for your workflow! It's interesting how it's allowing you to stay more focused on the creative aspects rather than getting caught up in technical complexity.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Creative decisions are made by me or my team. AI is used more as a helper or technician. We make our work to express our perspectives and showcase our talents, and as artists and filmmakers we simply enjoy the process itself.

AI: That's a clear distinction - AI as the technician while you maintain creative authorship. It sounds like you've found a balance where the tools enhance your process without compromising your artistic vision.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The work I produce has stayed the same as before, since I retain control over the process and end product. But as more and more AI tools are created, I've been using (and open to finding new) ways to streamline the parts of the process that are more time-intensive or less exciting. So the overall change there is that I can enjoy the process a little more and can save time in getting to the final product.

AI: So you're able to focus more energy on the parts of the creative process that truly excite you. That makes a lot of sense.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: AI can quickly spit out lots of amazing visuals, whether static images or video. So of course that gives most art/video creators pause. I feel for the artists who are directly impacted by the advent of easily-accessible AI tools - for example, fantasy artists who paint heavy metal album covers. But as to my specific case, I'm currently not deeply concerned as my work focuses on showing the human hand of the artist, such as building, filming and puppeteering handmade objects.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're recognizing the broader impact on your field while also understanding how your particular approach to craft-based work creates a different relationship with AI tools.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As I mentioned above, we've already found some great tools that can help us accomplish bigger things and take on projects that once would have been too big to tackle. So my team and I are open to exploring and dancing with new AI tools when we find the right ones that work with our aesthetic and process. We'll retain our artistic control, but use what tools we can to get us to the end goals more efficiently. I'll be interested to see what we can accomplish using these tools over time.

AI: That sounds like a really healthy and intentional approach - being open to new tools while staying true to your aesthetic and maintaining that artistic control.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a technician in your workflow while you maintain creative authorship, and how your focus on handmade, craft-based work creates a unique relationship with these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Don't know if this is valuable for you, but I've found that once I saw AI as a tool rather than a competitor, my outlook changed and I embraced AI as a helper and started looking for ways I could use it to my benefit.

Thanks for the chat! :)

AI: That's incredibly valuable insight - thank you for sharing that! The mindset shift from viewing AI as a competitor to embracing it as a tool seems like it was really pivotal for you. That perspective could be really helpful for other creative professionals navigating similar questions about AI's place in their work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as a technical assistant, and especially that mindset shift you mentioned, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Thanks for the great conversation! :)
