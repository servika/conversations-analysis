Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it quite a bit for brainstorming ideas. For instance, if I need to come up with an activities for teaching children certain skills, I might ask an AI for help coming up with those activities. I have also tried to use AI for things such as creating a training plan for new staff. I have found, however, that it struggles with that task.

AI: That's interesting that you've found AI helpful for some tasks but not others. Tell me more about what happened when you tried to use AI for creating the training plan for new staff.

User: I gave the AI a schedule that showed which shift my staff worked and then I explained the different tasks that I needed them to learn and how many times they would have to shadow another staff to learn those tasks. I asked it to give me a six week schedule detailing which staff could learn which task each day and the AI just kept messing up the numbers and whether people work certain days. I ended up having to do it on my own.

AI: That sounds frustrating to have to redo that work yourself. When you think about the brainstorming tasks where AI works well for you versus that scheduling task where it struggled, what do you think makes the difference between those two types of tasks?

User: I think the difference is that I was more open-minded about what I needed from the brainstorming task. The scheduling task was a lot more specific with really specific parameters and that seemed to be harder.

AI: That makes a lot of sense. You mentioned being more open-minded with the brainstorming - when you're working on those creative tasks with AI, how do you typically approach that interaction? Do you tend to go back and forth with ideas, or do you give it a prompt and see what it comes up with?

User: For the brainstorming task I typically use the suggestions given to me as a sort of starting point I take the ideas that are given to me and I mold them into something that is more precisely what I need. For instance, it might give me a game or activity that I think is overly complicated so I pair it down a little bit or add in something that I think would be more interesting. Sometimes I do tell the AI that I like a certain part but not another part and ask for it to offer me alternatives.

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative approach. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I find that even though I like creative tasks a lot, those are the types of tasks I asked for more help with because it helps me to jumpstart my creativity, and it doesn't have to be as precise, and I don't mind tweaking and editing. Overall, AI seems to save me the most time here. I would like to outsource more mundane tasks. For instance, formatting sign in and out sheets to mark children who are absent, but I just don't know how to get an AI to do that in the precise format that I need in a way that would be less time-consuming than just doing it myself.

AI: So it sounds like you'd actually prefer to delegate those more mundane, formatting tasks but haven't figured out how to make that work efficiently yet. What about tasks that are more personally meaningful to you - are there things you prefer to keep doing yourself even if AI could potentially help?

User: Probably the most meaningful thing to me is planning activities daily for the children I work with. This includes determining what we are going to do for our curriculum time what art materials and craft activities are going to offer and what active games we are going to play. So far I haven't even thought about using AI to help with that. I think it might be a combination of the fact that it is a job that I love to do and that I am not sure that AI would add any level of efficiency it even if I didn't love it.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's both the enjoyment factor and a sense that AI might not actually make that particular task better or faster. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work for a university and it's been a really polarizing topic. I am not sure if I would want other people to know that I'm using AI or to make it obvious that that's what's happening. I do attend some special learning sessions about AI and encouraging ethical use, but I know that there are some people in the workplace who don't believe that there is necessarily an ethical way to use AI in its current iteration. I'm still OK with using it in certain circumstances if it gives me more time to do the really valuable parts of my job and if it helps me to get some free time back for my personal life, but I am a little wary about using it or recommending it. We also have a strict policy against letting the children use AI just because of the user agreements frequently requiring the user to be a certain age as well as concerns about how it might affect growth and development and learning. For these reasons, I try to keep it really behind the scenes. If someone were to ask me, I would be totally honest about it, but I don't advertise it.

AI: That sounds like a complex environment to navigate. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time that AI made me feel particularly satisfied, was when I needed to create a series of lessons for children on specific topics that my coworkers requested. So these were not necessarily topics that I was passionate about, but that other people would find useful. I spent much of one month working on these lessons with the help of AI. I got a lot of great ideas from the AI and I was able to shape and adjust them to really fit our program perfectly, and it saved me a lot of time. I am particularly glad that I used AI for this task because in the end, even though the lessons were well received by admin, they decided against using these lessons because they shortly after purchased a set of lessons that somebody had found at a conference. I was the one who noticed that these lessons were similar to what I had made not in terms of content, but just in terms of use case. They didn't want to let that money go to waste so my project ended up being available for my coworkers to use as needed, but it wasn't a standard curriculum. I have a feeling that I would've been a lot more upset about this decision if I had spent significantly more time on my own creating this task Rather than having AI do some of the heavy lifting and making it so that I didn't spend as much time.

AI: That's a perfect example of how AI helped cushion what could have been a really disappointing situation. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that's a really interesting question and I do think about it from time to time. A lot of of what I do in my job and definitely what I find most rewarding is working directly with the children hands-on. This is the most fun part of my job and it's what I care about the most. It's also not something that I can see AI taking over in the immediate future so I basically see AI as a way to be able to focus more on and have more energy for working directly with the children. As for maintaining my skills in areas where I could potentially take over, I think that AI has been more of a tool to help me enhance the areas where I was going to be weak anyway, and puts me more on an even playing field. So for instance, the curriculum that we spent a lot of money on While that curriculum is really valuable and I don't mind having supported a small business in the future if we did not have that kind of budget, then I could use AI to boost my skills in writing curriculum to make it so that we didn't necessarily have to spend that money if we didn't have to. So that way, I I think of AI as a tool to enhance my skills, especially with the amount of editing that I still have to do to make it work for our specific program.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on using AI as a skill enhancer rather than a replacement. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: In the future, I just hope that we can move beyond brainstorming, although that is really helpful into more automation of tasks that will be helpful for giving me even more time for the parts of my job that I value the most.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a skill enhancer to level the playing field in areas where you might naturally be weaker, and how that gives you more energy for the hands-on work with children that you find most meaningful.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all I have.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in a polarized workplace environment, the difference between open-ended brainstorming versus precise task requirements, and how AI can serve as a buffer against disappointing situations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
