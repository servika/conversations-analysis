Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope im ready when you are

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: i typically use AI as a collaborative partner to bounce ideas off of. I create t shirts so I often collab with AI to brainstorm designs, color schemes, etc.

AI: That sounds like a really creative collaboration. When you're brainstorming designs and color schemes with AI, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I usually already have a few ideas in mind whether I have a few colors in mind or different fonts for the text on the shirt, if I have a specific vibe im going for, for example bohemian, i might ask an AI how I can adjust my design to help it fit the vibe im going for. I also use it to help me think of phrases or words to put on the shirts. Overall, I usually come to the AI with somewhat of a plan already in my head, and I get its perspective and help executing it.

AI: It sounds like you come to AI with a foundation already in place. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your t-shirt design process you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Definitely so one thing I always prefer doing myself is the actual designs, it's easy to ask AI to come up with a cool design to slap on a tshirt but that takes away the human art element. I don't like to just "copy" what the AI gives me but use as inspiration instead. Same for phrases, I don't like to use what they say word for word because it lacks the human element. An exception to this being funny shirts with short phrases (i.e., puns) or bible quotes that are actual quotes.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as inspiration while preserving the human art element. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it throughout the task I almost never delegate any tasks for it to handle independently.

AI: That collaborative approach makes sense given what you've shared about preserving the creative elements. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: There are so many people who create and sell t shirts with so many different styles. I try to use AI to help my products stay unique and relevant while still being trendy. It's a hard balance to have, and I know others utilize AI in the same way I do to create their designs and brainstorm ideas.

AI: That balance between unique and trendy sounds challenging, especially in such a competitive space. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the most memorable time would be when I first started using AI to help me brainstorm. My brain was completely stuck and I was at a "creative block" and I started talking through with the AI what I was doing, where I was stuck at, and what I was going for. The AI gave me different suggestions of routes I could go with the design, and helped me execute them. I would get feedback from the AI once I made progress to get input. I was really satisfied with how well it understood my intent and captured the vibe that I was going for- which led to me utilizing it much more often.

AI: That breakthrough moment sounds really powerful - having AI understand your intent and vibe so well. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I still maintain my skills where AI can take over - I think AI is an amazing and powerful tool but if it becomes something I *have* to rely on to get my job done then I personally feel like I'm not doing enough. Especially because there are many things that can go wrong with technology, and so I generally still like to know how to do things even if its simpler to have the AI do them in an everyday situation if that makes sense. Essentially, I completely utilize the convenience, but I don't want to become dependent on AI.

AI: That makes complete sense - using the convenience while maintaining your independence. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think my relationship with AI at work will evolve in plenty of ways. It's constantly been evolving as AIs get smarter and I've learned which processes work best for me and the AI to complete tasks most efficiently. I think it will continue to get better at the designs it creates and understanding more unique and artistic views that an artist might be trying to describe

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as inspiration while preserving that human art element, and how you maintain that balance between convenience and independence.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope that's it!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authenticity while leveraging AI as a collaborative brainstorming partner will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really interesting to hear how you've found that sweet spot between using AI's capabilities and preserving what makes your work uniquely human. Have a great rest of your day!
