Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I create messaging and visuals for a state transportation agency's occupational safety division. We have to cover the same topics so the basic content doesn't change. The creativity is how to say the same thing, without it feeling like the same thing. I also create themes and collateral for our Safe Days of Summer Campaign and our state dump truck roadeo. I also have to think about content management, work flows and editorial calendars. January through August is usually pretty busy. I also do emergency weather response messaging for ice storms and hurricanes. September through December is usually planning activities.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of creative and strategic work. It sounds like you're constantly balancing consistency with freshness - keeping safety messages effective while making them feel new.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: For the past couple of years I have used it to ideate content for our Safe Days of Summer campaign where we have 18 weeks of materials going out, from May 1 to Aug. 31. Each week we cover a new topic in a brief, video, email and webpage. The content is generally the same on each of those, but I have to reproduce that 18 times during the summer and present it in a cohesive way. So I'm usually given the overall theme some phrase, last year it was safety is a habit. This year it was safety in action. And I want to find novel ways to present the information so I ask AI how can we present this content in an interesting and engaging way? I also rely on AI when I'm staring at a blank page and I just need to get some ideas processing. Or if I'm given a bunch of topics that don't really relate to each other, I ask AI how they could be presented. For me it's more of a thinking tool than a writing tool. How do these pieces fit together? What is the best way to present the information that these people have seen a bazillion times?

AI: That's fascinating - so you're using AI as a kind of creative catalyst rather than asking it to do the writing itself. It sounds like you're leveraging it to break through that initial creative block and find fresh angles on familiar material.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I am all for using AI. But my workplace is not so much. They are starting to wade into it. So I have to be careful on how much I'm using the tool. That said, I used it on formulating a outline for the safety and action campaign. It was based on movies. But our big boss is using purpose, practice, and people as his speaking theme for the year. I'm not sure where it came from. So we had to incorporate his purpose, practice, and people into this fun movie theme. And that kind of sucked. So again the AI was more of a thinker. Let's say the main topic for the week is hydration. The main idea was let hydration be your costar. We would have a safety brief with movie puns and  and how to hydrate and stay hydrated and then at the bottom of each brief, we would have purpose practice and people sections. Why do we hydrate? How do we hydrate? Who do we help by hydrating? So the very beginning of the project I didn't have any of this fleshed out. I ran it through AI many times to see how to connect the very corporate purpose practice people into the fun movie Summer Blockbuster, kind of theme. We got there eventually, but it took some time.

AI: That sounds like a really challenging creative puzzle - trying to bridge that gap between a fun movie theme and corporate messaging requirements. It's interesting that you describe going back to AI "many times" to work through that connection.

When you're working with AI in those iterative sessions, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am driving the decisions, but AI is working through "does it make sense?" Last year our safety is a habit campaign was successful because of a fluke that AI said. Again, I was working with a very corporate theme of habits and it's not very visual. So I was trying over and over again to get ideas on how to present it visually. The AI came up with cards that had the topic on it and on the cards it had a list of things they could check off of doing. Habits. But then it turned into. Hey why don't they do one of these habits each workday Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? And so our email would have the list of daily habits and the safety officers they loved it because they had a lesson for every day and it was all related tied up in a bow. It was great. So when I am using AI, I'm looking for that nugget of gold that is a new way of thinking about these topics.

AI: That's such a great example of how AI can surprise you with an unexpected connection that transforms the whole project. It sounds like you're really skilled at recognizing when AI gives you that "nugget of gold" - that moment when it offers something that shifts your thinking in a useful direction.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I can get project started much quicker. I don't have to stare at that blank page or toss things around in my mind as much. I just have to do some creative prompting with AI to see what it says. I can also work faster in that. It's almost like I have an intern. They're not perfect but they do the work quick. I can look at finessing and refining and executing rather than the thinking planning organizing stuff.

AI: That's a really vivid way to put it - having an intern who's fast but needs direction and refinement. It sounds like AI has shifted your role more toward the editorial and strategic side, which seems to play to your strengths.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I worry that AI will eventually be really, really good at sounding human. Then it'll give non-writers and non-creators a tool when they're not experts in that field. It's like when blogging took over journalism. They're not formally trained on the principles of balanced communication and answering who when where why and inverted pyramid and all that stuff but they're putting out information and people believe it. Right now people are using it as writing and they're not even taking out the stupid parts. It sounds very non-human at this point, but they think that's good writing. Now will we get there in the next five years I don't know. People have already tried to squash writing with AI with AI detectors. But those don't work very well and frankly, they've you know accuse me of using AI when I've written something from scratch. The creative field it's not like science where I couldn't just go into a lab and say well I told me to do this experiment. Once people figure out AI can help them be creative then human creativity is gonna go the way of journalism. Nobody will really know what role in plays.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern about the erosion of expertise and training. The journalism parallel is striking - that shift from trained professionals to anyone with access to the tools, and how that changes the quality and reliability of what gets produced.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I hope that my workplace embraces AI. I want it to continue to be an assistant but get more helpful and more nuanced. Like have a mode where you can say "creativity mode" or "editorial mode" and it would have some level of expertise. Right now it's the jack of all trades. Sometimes you get good ideas and sometimes it's like do you even know what creativity is? Those modes that I just mentioned could be also things like "fitness mode" "financial advisor mode" where people don't have to put in a long drawn out, prompt about being a financial advisor.

AI: That's a really compelling vision - having AI that can shift into specialized modes based on the type of thinking you need. It sounds like you want to maintain that assistant relationship but with more sophisticated domain expertise.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a thinking tool rather than a writing tool, and that great example of how the daily habits idea transformed your whole campaign.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I will say that I hope that the photography/video production capabilities of AI will improve a lot. But not so much where nefarious people are sending out fake videos about things and causing trouble. But the visuals as they are now are terrible. I would not use any of them.

AI: That's a really important point about the visual capabilities - wanting them to improve for legitimate creative work while being mindful of the potential for misuse. It sounds like you see a clear gap between where AI visuals are now and what would actually be useful for professional creative work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a thinking partner, the challenges of balancing corporate requirements with creative themes, and your thoughtful concerns about the future of expertise in creative fields - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the opportunities and the challenges you see ahead.
