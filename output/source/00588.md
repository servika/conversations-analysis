Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm good to go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use it for social media content creation. So the two key AI tools I use are Opus, which I use to clip up interviews I film (and automatically add subtitles to them) and get them ready for social media, and then Otter, which I use for transcribing interviews I record on audio with filmmakers. I don't use any AI tools for problem-solving or for text/caption creation.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI for very specific production tasks but not for the creative writing aspects. 

Can you walk me through what your process looks like when you're working with these tools? For instance, when you're using Opus to clip up interviews, what does that workflow actually look like day-to-day?

User: Well for starters, I wouldn't use them day-to-day. I go through phases where I'd use Opus a lot on a specific day/week, loading in raw interview footage, reviewing the clips that it creates, and exporting the ones I like. Typically, it gets 8-10 great, sixty second clips out of a 20 minute interview. That will cover us on our social media for a few weeks, and then I'll go back to Opus and repeat the process with a new interview.

AI: That batch approach makes a lot of sense. When you're reviewing those 8-10 clips that Opus generates, what are you looking for when you decide which ones to keep and which ones to skip?

User: Forgot to add in my previous message: with Otter, I do that more seldomly, as more interviews we conduct are filmed. Any interviewee who opts for just audio recording instead, I'd then port that file into Otter. 

Anyway, in answer to your question, I'm usually looking for just how engaging the clip is for our audience - current, prospective, and incoming film students. So if the clip sheds light on the interview subject, and their career and filmmaking style, or if it gives advice to our students, then I'll happily export it. If it's a bit more rambly or self-indulgent, I usually leave it. I also tend to ignore the AI-generated video clip titles, as they're usually quite broad and don't do a great job of capturing what the clip is about.

AI: So you're making editorial judgments about what resonates with your specific audience - that's a very human-centered decision. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you don't use AI tools for problem-solving or text creation. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, definitely. Anything to do with writing, I always do myself. Writing emails for our students, social media captions, blogs, all that stuff: I never use AI for. There are definitely certain tasks that AI could do a fine job at, and it would maybe save me time, but I still opt against it as I like to have a human touch on all our written content. I would never have AI write a blog for us, because I think the students deserve more nuanced, cultivated, and personal written content - especially considering the fees they pay for our courses are very high.

For things like WhatsApp messages to our students, highlighting opportunities in the film world as well as upcoming deadlines, I definitely see how AI could do a good job at crafting them. However, I still prefer to do it myself. This is probably partly due to my qualifications as a journalist - I like to keep writing and AI separate, as a result.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're drawing between efficiency and authenticity, especially given the high-stakes nature of your student relationships.

When you are using AI for those production tasks like with Opus and Otter, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with the AI throughout the task, or do you tend to give it the raw material and let it handle things independently before you step back in?

User: Both Opus and Otter offer means of collaboration and cultivation prior to commencing the transcription work, such as highlighting keywords from the interview that I want included, etc. However, I usually just trust both softwares to do an accurate job, and I feel that I'd spot any mistakes in their results if they were present. Opus lets you edit mistakes in the captions very easily, which I do from time to time. It also lets you select the clip lengths prior to clip creation, which I always do - opting for 30-60 seconds. But for the most part, it is just me giving it raw material, and then engaging with the end result of its transcription/creation process.

AI: So you're setting some basic parameters upfront but then largely stepping back and letting the tools do their work. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that there are any spoken or unspoken expectations about AI use in your environment?

User: It's gone both ways: I introduced my colleagues to Otter, which they approve of (although only I use), and then my colleagues introduced me to Opus, which we all approve of and use. The expectation - and reality - of my use of AI is that it has expedited processes that previously took a lot longer, and thus has created more free time for me to engage with other work tasks.

AI: That mutual influence is interesting - it sounds like you've all found ways to enhance productivity together.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: On the topic of Opus and Otter, both consistently make me feel satisfied for the most part. Occasionally, Opus will glitch out and combine two different interview clips into one clip and present it as the one uninterrupted clip, and essentially have two different sets of footage running simultaneously. That is frustrating, but rarely happens.

Outside of that, my use of Google during work often runs into issues with AI Overviews being incorrect.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can be reliable in some contexts but problematic in others. The Google AI Overviews issue you mentioned is particularly interesting since that's affecting your broader information-gathering process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think just continuing to write as I do, and maintaining the personal element of my writing, is the main way in which I'm maintaining a skill that AI could "take over" - despite my belief that there is always going to be preference for human writing over AI writing.

Besides that, I'll still maintain my moderate skills in editing as I was trained on it in college, and you never know when it could come in handy.

AI: That confidence in the lasting value of human writing really comes through in how you approach your work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself potentially expanding into other AI tools, or are you pretty settled with your current approach?

User: I think I'm fairly settled, as I've already explored the full scope of my responsibilities in work and can't see any new aspects of my workload that could be expedited by AI - besides those that I've already dismissed as a matter of preference. But you never know to be fair, as I certainly never considered using Opus until I tried it, and it has been an absolute game-changer.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between tasks where you value efficiency gains versus those where you prioritize the human touch - especially given your background in journalism and the high expectations of your students.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really no, I've covered it all. My final point would be that, as I've implied, my relationship towards the idea of using AI in work has shifted quite a bit since my use of Otter and Opus - especially Opus. While I do think this is the limit to which I'll use AI in work, and I certainly don't plan on using AI every single day, it has made me re-evaluate my relationship with AI in a more positive light.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - how your direct experience with specific tools has shifted your overall perspective on AI, even while maintaining clear boundaries about where you will and won't use it.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that sweet spot between efficiency and authenticity, and how hands-on experience can change attitudes, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
