Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not, let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI in everyday workload. My full time role is supply planner but I fit more into the business analytics. I typically look for advice on SQL queries, DAX analysis and overall guidance and reporting structures.

AI: That's really helpful context. As a supply planner working with business analytics, it sounds like you're dealing with a lot of data analysis and technical queries.

When you say you look for advice on SQL queries and DAX analysis, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do you typically interact with AI when you need help with those technical aspects?

User: RIght, so overall I'm familiar enough with SQL to be dangerous but the advanced query techniques are what I really use it for. For example when I'm pulling the data from Databricks i'll bounce ideas or look for specific language to make sure the query works successfully the first time I run it and to ensure I don't have as many syntax errors

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a technical partner to help refine your queries before running them. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The startup is something I like to handle myself, I feel as if I try to build the base of the query and discuss with AI after I have a baseline build, I end up learning more and building my knowledge base on the topics I require assistance on. I like to use AI as a learning tool by verifying against my current build and taking into consideration what it provides as feedback and learning from it

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI more as a learning partner rather than having it do the work from scratch. It sounds like you've found a way to maintain your own skill development while still getting the benefits of AI assistance.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I prefer to collaborate throughout the task rather than delegating entire segments to the AI model. I do however delegate small thins such as consolidating large email threads that I need to catch up on providing me with the list of tasks on my plate for the day in office.

AI: That's interesting - so you've found different approaches for different types of work. You collaborate on the technical analytical work but delegate more administrative tasks like email consolidation and daily task organization.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped how openly you use it or the types of tasks you feel comfortable using it for?

User: My company has openly embraced AI and its widely recommended to use AI where possible. Whether that is to delegate repetitive tasks or build slide decks or talk through problems. Before we had openly embraced this I wouldn't say apprehensive but I didn't see the benefits at the time in using AI. Now I view it as a tool to use and collaborate with to make me more productive and a valued asset with the teams I work with

AI: That shift from not seeing the benefits to now viewing it as a collaborative tool is really interesting. It sounds like having that organizational support made a big difference in how you approached AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can provide both examples - from a frustration standpoint the current model is not exactly up to date on the latest version of PowerBI, etc we use in our industry. This leads to outdated advice or not up to date recommendations on queries.  This leads me to having to result to googling advice or reading the current literature for the version of these products to ensure I'm up to par on the specific version. From a big difference standpoint - the efforts and collaboration I utilized while "partering" with AI have made my learnings within the realms of SQL/PowerBI have been exponentially faster than if I were to teach myself on my own

AI: Those are both really concrete examples - the version mismatch creating friction versus the accelerated learning when AI's knowledge aligns with what you need.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is something I've considered heavily. This is why I like sharpening my skills alongside AI to ensure my knowledge base it up to standard. A lot of supply planning is about managing expectations and reacting with things don't go as expected, this (at the moment) I do not expect AI to handle even down the road. Again I feel like working together to enhance and optimize low priority tasks, repetitive things, etc is where AI can really shine

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing that the human judgment aspects of supply planning, especially managing expectations and handling unexpected situations, remain uniquely valuable while using AI to optimize the more routine elements.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I look forward to see the AI models grow and learn, the more up to date they are the more I can rely on the most accurate information and ultimately provide the end-users the best experience possible. I really see myself using AI the same as it is now, we actually do weekly sessions with supply chain discussing the future of AI and how to envolve it within our workflows

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning partner while maintaining your own skill development, and how you've found different interaction patterns for different types of tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I do not

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing collaboration with skill development, and how organizational culture can shift AI adoption, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
