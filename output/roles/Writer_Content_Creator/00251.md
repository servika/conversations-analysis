Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Providing information summaries and data compilation

AI: Tell me more about that. What kinds of information are you typically summarizing, and what does the data compilation process look like for you?

User: For my role specifically it is mostly reviewing the history of a relationship we have with specific clients and presenting a short summary for someone unfamiliar with the client. It provides a summary of who the client is with relevant personal information, information about previous conversations and interactions with company personnel, and any relevant work orders or tasks that are important to the relationship.

AI: That sounds like a really specific and important use case. When you're working on these client relationship summaries, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you feed it all the client information at once and ask for a complete summary, or do you work through it section by section together?

User: The AI is fed with the information and once and asked to provide a summary

AI: So you're delegating the complete summarization task to the AI. I'm curious - are there parts of that client relationship summary process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with those parts too?

User: Yes - it can be more helpful for me to review detailed notes instead of relying on just a summary

AI: That's interesting. When you choose to review those detailed notes yourself instead of relying on the AI summary, what makes that more helpful for you? What do you get from that detailed review that the summary might miss?

User: Specific quotes from the client. More descriptive language to help understand the context and emotion behind the interactions. The date and how recent the conversation was

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those nuanced details about tone, timing, and exact wording can be crucial for understanding client relationships. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others on your team approach these client summaries similarly, or have you seen different approaches?

User: Mostly the same - if they are different, it is usually people just not using them

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Nothing really comes to mind. But where I have been left wanting is needing more detailed information as opposed to a summary. Overall I think it is helpful because the summary does make it easier to see and understand helpful information that is not as sensitive for understanding context or detail. The summary can be helpful in mentioning an event or interaction that I know to go looking for instead of trying to find organically

AI: That's a really insightful point - using the AI summary almost like a roadmap that points you toward the specific details you need to dive deeper on. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I consider it some, but the skills are mostly emotional intelligence based and it's hard to imagine AI fully taking over where a human touch can still be very important

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it expanding into other areas, or do you think it will mostly stay in this current role of helping with summaries and data compilation?

User: I think it will expand into other areas to some extent. I know our company uses it for other roles that would use it differently so if I change roles, I would expect there to be new/different uses

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI summaries as a roadmap to identify which detailed information to investigate further - that's a really nuanced way of thinking about the collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: For me it is important the AI does not provide wrong information

AI: That's a crucial point. When you say it's important that AI doesn't provide wrong information, have you encountered situations where accuracy was a concern, or is this more about the potential risk given how sensitive client relationship information can be?

User: Not sensitivity but if it provided wrong information, it could cause an error or mistake in working with the client that could lead to the client terminating the relationship

AI: That's a really important consideration - the stakes are quite high when client relationships are on the line. Thank you for bringing that up.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point while maintaining that human oversight for accuracy and context have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
