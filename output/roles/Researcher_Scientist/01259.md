Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Not yet, please continue

AI: Perfect, let's get started then.

To begin, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was working on a research project that involved incorporating a heterogeneous catalyst into the recycling and reprocessing of PET plastics. The project was a handover from a previous project that looked at the issues of PET degradation, and how repeated cycles using the same PET caused damage to the polymer framework. The final conclusion made by the previous project manager was that the carboxylic acid end of the monomer would incorrectly degrade to a vinyl end when the polymer was broken apart. This would then react with any water in the system to form an alcohol end, and thus the monomer was no longer able to react in the same way. The reason for this degradation was simply shear stress and strain from the high pressures and temperatures within the system.

My role was to carry this forward. When I took over the project, there were two issues to tackle. The first was that the degradation of PET resulted in many other products being mixed in to the plastic which were able to diffuse into any liquids stored inside it. One of these chemicals was acetaldehyde, and causes a fruity 'off' taste to any liquids stored inside, with a human detection threshold of 60 ppb. Currently, this is removed using anthaniliamide in a 1:1 chemical reaction, which is 70% effective. The abatement of acetaldehyde was considered the priority goal.
The second goal was to try and improve the quality of the PET by reducing degradation. This would make it effective for many more PET cycles.

At the project start, the equipment used to synthesise PET plastics was new. This means that with an operating lifetime of 15 to 20 years, changing the equipment in any way was not possible, and so I had to find a way to achieve my goal without needing any additional engineering. This made me gravitate towards using a heterogeneous catalysis first, as these are easy to remove from feedstocks. 

When I took over this project, I had a meeting with members from two companies that would work together collaboratively on this. The first meeting was to discuss what possible routes that could be taken to succeed with our objectives. We discussed the machinery and the equipment that we could work with - how it works, the conditions inside, limitations - and we came up with a list of things that could be altered during the process. 

The next stage was the information research stage, which I performed independently. This was looking up any information to see if something like this had been done before, and starting to build an information bank to identify any patterns between materials.

Next was the testing phase. A model reactor was built to test the interactions of acetaldehyde over any potential catalysts that had been identified. A gas-phase reactor with a fixed bed was chosen, with a built-in GC-MS to monitor the gas feed to determine how active the catalyst was, how much acetaldehyde was removed, and what products were formed. 1000 ppm of acetaldehyde in argon was chosen as the feed gas mixture to mimic the low concentrations and 'inert' atmospheres (ie total oxidation not possible) of the extruder that is used for reprocessing.
During this phase we tested many different heterogeneous catalysts, from metal oxides and mixed metal oxides, to zeolites, to supported nanoparticles. Once we had an idea of what worked and what didn't, we moved on to the next phase.

The next phase was the incorporation or scale-up phase. Here, we tested our catalysts in the synthesis of PET bottles, which involved making the preform and blowing them to 2 L bottles. We then analysed everything we could about the PET that formed - colour, strength, haze, and of course content of acetaldehyde. The important part here was to determine whether our catalysts actually were able to operate for their intended purposes. Here, only a small number of catalysts proved to be viable, and were nowhere near the 70% benchmark that we had set. Those that showed promise were evaluated and taken back to the testing phase in the model reactor. 

Once catalysts had been pushed to their limits in both the testing and scale-up phases, we evaluated why this might be the case. We looked back to PET plastics and found that some resins were made with antimony metal, while others were made with Nickel. We doped samples of each catalyst with both metals, and re-ran some tests. While those doped with antimony saw the reactivity decrease to almost 0% in every case, those doped with nickel were unaffected. As a final part of the evaluation stage, we tried our catalyst on nickel resins. We found that while the catalyst cleared more acetaldehyde molecules from the PET of nickel resins, it still removed the same percentage of acetaldehyde from both (nickel resins tend to produce up to 50 ppm of acetaldehyde, while antimony resins only produce 10 ppm at maximum). This meant that it was more likely that our catalysts were mobility limited within the reaction stream - this made sense as they were more dense than the PET, so likely sank to the bottom.

The final stage of my involvement in this project was to set some future goals and to summarise what needed to be done for this project to succeed. I concluded that the heterogeneous catalysts we tested had great potential - they clearly removed acetaldehyde from the waste stream, and some of them also catalysed the breakdown of PET using much lower temperatures. I also established why this might be, and set frameworks for the next catalysts that should be produced. I also looked at alternative places where catalysts could be employed and found that one other area is during the blowing of the PET mould, where it is heated to 130 Celsius using IR radiation at approximately 1100nm in wavelength. I found other materials that act as a catalyst only in the presence of IR, and suggested these for the future project leader.

Ultimately, my role in this was to oversee the project from:
Conception > Research > Testing > Scale-up > Evaluation > Conclusions/Future Suggestions
and I would say that I succeeded in this.

AI: Thank you for that detailed walkthrough - that's a fascinating project with some really interesting challenges around the antimony interference and mobility limitations. You've clearly navigated a complex multi-phase process from conception through to future recommendations.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Sadly, AI was not reliable tool while I was working on this project. The AI that was available was locked behind a large paywall that I could not justify paying.

AI came in to play two years after I passed on this project to my successor. I was asked to come back and listen to a talk and give advice to the project based on my own experience and what I had heard here. 

The first thing I did was have the AI look at my own data and see what conclusions it came up with. If it differed from mine using the same data, I asked it why and then had it model some interactions for me. I then used AI to bounce my own theories off of, and had a fresh take on the project I handed over. Finally, I used the AI to look at the data I was going to be presented with, and see if it drew the same conclusions, or if there was anywhere else that it differed. I asked it if the two datasets were in complete competition with each other, complete support, or if they weren't quite vibing together but could if we approached our theories from another angle. 

In short, AI was my reminder, second opinion, fact checker, paper finder, and 'spot the difference science addition' all in one.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - using AI as essentially a scientific collaborator after the fact to validate and challenge your thinking. You mentioned several different roles it played for you.

Tell me more about when you had AI look at your original data and it drew different conclusions than you did - what was that experience like?

User: It was both refreshing and infuriating. Whether it agreed with me or not, the AI would have wonderful insight and allow me to consider things I may have not thought of. It was also nice to be able to say the most stupid, idiotic ideas and critique them legitimately, without any humiliation or repercussion of 'that stupid thing you said or did' which can often happen in academia.

That said, sometimes the AI would give such incorrect answers or get things so far wrong on a fundamental 'GCSE basics' level, and then argue with me until I gave up trying to explain why it is wrong. The AI has so much patience, and that is a two-edged sword. It is patient for my stupidity, and patient for its own.

The most helpful role for the AI assistant was definitely finding research papers. I could ask it on a specific topic, anything generally related to a topic, and then customise my search criteria to look at only most recent papers, or papers that featured a certain scientist. It was far more effecient at finding relevant material, and even found some gemstones in places I would not have thought to look.

AI: That's such a vivid description - "patient for my stupidity, and patient for its own" really captures something important about that dynamic. It sounds like the paper finding was transformative for your research process.

You mentioned that sometimes the AI would get fundamental basics wrong and then argue with you about it. For the areas where AI was giving you useful insights versus where it was getting things fundamentally wrong - how did you learn to tell the difference, or verify what it was telling you?

User: Sometimes you just know the answer is wrong. Like 2 + 2 = 5. It doesn't add up. For the more complex questions and answers, particularly where it is missing important nuance or context, you often have to ask probing questions. Fortunately, I am a trained teacher so I can ask questions in such a way that I could get to the root of why the AI kicked out an incorrect answer. The best feeling was when the AI got an answer wrong initially, and I was able to ask probing questions that actually caused it to change its own answer to the same one that I originally thought was correct.

AI: That's fascinating - your teaching background giving you the skills to essentially debug the AI's reasoning process. It sounds like you developed a real methodology for working with it.

We're about a third of the way through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the parts of your original research project - the catalyst testing, the scale-up phases, the evaluation - where you haven't used AI, what's kept you from trying it in those areas?

User: At this time, AI just wasn't good enough. It could compute very basic things, do organisation, all that stuff that would have been helpful. I was under a non-disclosure agreement however, and so did not put in any information that could have disrupted that agreement. For the things that it would have been helpful for - like screening catalysts and finding relevant literature surrounding them - the AI that was available wasn't quite good enough for this at the time.

AI: That makes perfect sense - both the NDA constraints and the limitations of what was available at the time. The timing aspect seems really important here.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - either from that original PET project or your research work more generally - what would that be and why?

User: A lab partner would be fun. Someone to physically do experiments with and then go for a beer. Science for me has always been about fun, but there are few who have the same excitement for it as I do. Making things explode, change colours, make people go 'wow' and ultimate inspire them to follow science for themselves is what I have enjoyed, and I've never met anyone who would be willing to go through the completely dangerous process of finding the 'wow' that has never been seen before.

For my actual career, it would be nice to have someone to talk to as I worked - that could take down all of my thoughts as I spoke them and then summarise them neatly. And argue with me on them. And help me stay organised because my ADHD is causing me to suffer when it comes to maintaining an organised lab.

AI: That's such a heartfelt answer - the desire for that shared excitement and discovery, someone who gets the thrill of the "wow" moments. And the practical side of having a thinking partner who could help with organization and capture your thoughts in real-time sounds incredibly valuable for how your mind works.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on AI as both a scientific collaborator and the very human need for shared excitement in discovery were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: It's very important to understand that AI and humans can not and should not replace each other. Instead, we need to go hand in hand, and recognise the strengths that each one has. AI, while able to learn incredibly quickly, verify facts, and scan literature, does not and likely will not ever have the nature of exploration and discovery, not like humans do. AI is very good at asking and answering 'why', but humans have the 'why not?' down. 

We need to walk the path to the future together, where one improves the other and vice versa on a continuous cycle.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, and especially that distinction between AI's strength with "why" questions versus humans' natural "why not?" exploration, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Your perspective on needing that shared excitement and discovery - the human elements that make science fulfilling - was particularly valuable for us to hear. It's clear you've thought deeply about both the practical applications and the fundamental nature of scientific collaboration.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you so much for your time today!

User: Thank you so much for including me in this project, and I hope that I can work with you (the AI and the people behind it) once again in the future.

AI: That's so kind of you to say! I really enjoyed our conversation too - your enthusiasm for science and thoughtful reflections on human-AI collaboration were genuinely engaging. The way you described using your teaching skills to debug AI reasoning, and your vision of AI and humans walking the path to the future together, will definitely stick with me.

Thank you for being such an thoughtful participant. I hope our paths cross again in future research as well. Take care!
