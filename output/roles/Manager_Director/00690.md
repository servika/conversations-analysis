Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I normally use AI for researching procedures and protocol. I work in a remote call center environment involving healthcare and Medicare D prescription management. They have recently incorporated AI when it comes to helping us navigate our knowledge database. AI also listens to and summarizes our calls for our own record keeping purposes. We also have copilot tools available to us to help with emails, resumes, or writing tasks as well.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is integrated into multiple layers of your work. You mentioned AI helps you navigate your knowledge database and also listens to your calls for summarization.

When you're using AI to research procedures and protocol, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you interact with it during those moments?

User: I am usually typing in keywords into a knowledge database when I need to locate specific policies and procedures. With AI i have to type at least 3 words, preferably in question format in order to get the AI to kick in. The AI will respond with a summarized answer to my question, and also provide links to articles that provide the answers to my question, for my own fact checking.

AI: That's helpful - so you're getting both the summarized answer and the source links for verification. 

Tell me more about how this changes your workflow compared to before AI was integrated. What was it like searching that knowledge database without AI assistance?

User: This has definitely helped in ways. Before AI was integrated, articles would come up with keywords, but many articles were buried or hidden in our knowledge database. The AI would search more comprehensively and find articles. We have help chats as well with human beings who help us, but the AI has sometimes provided more scenarios where I was able to avoid having to ask for help.

AI: That's really valuable insight - it sounds like the AI is helping you find information that might have been difficult to locate before, and giving you more independence in solving problems.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to document my notes myself rather than copying from the call summaries provided by AI. The AI call summaries don't always catch everything and don't include important info such as prescription numbers. As of right now I prefer to use a manual note generator that helps me keep my notes short and precise, this note generator is not powered by AI its a tool that lets us input keywords into a chart and uses those keywords to produce a quick note. I also write my own notes. I also prefer to write my own resumes, I don't like using AI for that, as I have never done that before. Sometimes I don't use AI to look up documents or procedure, as sometimes I know where to look so I look myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you're being quite strategic about when to rely on AI versus your own judgment and knowledge. The point about AI missing prescription numbers in call summaries is particularly interesting since that's such critical information in your field.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I mainly use it for researching knowledge articles, and I do collaborate. I don't trust it independently, as it makes mistakes. I check the sources it cites to make sure it is truly answering my questions.

AI: That verification approach sounds really important in your line of work. You mentioned that AI makes mistakes - can you tell me about a specific time when you caught an error or when the AI didn't quite get it right? What happened in that situation?

User: One time it made a mistake was when I was asking if I am able to give out drug NPIs to members who call in. It misinterpreted my question as there are no articles that directly answer my question, so it gave the closest article that referred to when a member is requesting a specific NPI, but my question was different. It also when summarizing calls has gotten names wrong, my name is [REDACTED] so it often thinks I am Lauren for example.

AI: Those are really concrete examples - the NPI question mix-up shows how AI can struggle when there isn't a direct match, and the name confusion during call summaries could definitely be problematic for record-keeping.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others approach it similarly to you, or are there different attitudes around the office?

User: I am honestly not sure, but from what I have heard, people who use the AI find it somewhat helpful for the same reasons I do when it comes to searching our knowledge database. I do know that other colleagues then to rely on it more for their note keeping, they just copy and paste the call summaries. I don't usually feel comfortable doing that.

AI: It's interesting that you're more cautious about the note-taking piece while others are comfortable copying those summaries. That suggests you've developed your own comfort level with where AI helps versus where you want to maintain control.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I felt particularly satisfied was when I had not known of a VIP program that our company offers. When I searched "VIP Program" I wasn't finding the answers I needed. When I searched "Does Express Scripts offer a VIP Program?" the AI kicked in and provided me with a more helpful link.

AI: That's a perfect example of how AI can uncover information that traditional keyword searching missed. The fact that phrasing it as a question made all the difference is really telling.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider this. I do think there will be a consistent need for human oversight and assistance. It is something I do sometimes consider but I don't worry about it too much. Many of our members do not prefer automation, they prefer to deal with human beings.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - the member preference for human interaction is definitely a key factor in your field.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: I do see myself using it in the future. I am not sure how different it will be, but I can imagine that more of the procedures we do manually will incorporate AI assistance. I can see it expanding on the ways we already utilize AI, I can see it being incorporated more into our emails and manual processes.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed your own approach to verification and when to trust AI versus relying on your own knowledge and judgment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all I have, thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI assistance and human oversight, especially in a healthcare context where accuracy is so critical, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional settings.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
