Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a musician, so my projects range from producing to songwriting and everything in between.

AI: That's fascinating - music spans so many different creative disciplines. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find myself asking AI for help when I have too many ideas running and need help sorting them into one. For example, when I have a couple of different ideas for the vibes of the song, or even when trying to mix genres, I ask AI to give me ideas of similar artists or songs, or even ask if it's something that could work.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a kind of creative compass when you're in that abundant but overwhelming idea space. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Again, I had many ideas going for a song, and I used AI to confirm that it would be possible to mix these genres, and got confirmation that other artists experimented with these sounds as well. It made me feel more confident in what I thought were "chaotic ideas." I also used it to generate a list of words that reminded me of a specific visual that I was then able to write from. It made my process flow smoother because I sort of hit a wall and couldn't really find the right words I was looking for.

AI: That's really compelling - it sounds like AI helped you both validate your creative instincts and break through a creative block. You mentioned it made your "chaotic ideas" feel more legitimate.

When you're working with AI in these moments, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I would say I was driving the creative decisions because I was inputting all of my own ideas; I just needed some help untangling the different aspects of things, such as the themes, the aesthetic, and the sound. The AI was certainly an aid, but I didn't pull straight up AI ideas from it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you're maintaining creative ownership while using AI more as a thinking partner to help organize and validate what's already coming from you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It's less time-consuming because I don't have to sit in a creative block. I know I can throw ideas into the AI system, and it can generate something that combines all of my thinking into one solid song or idea. I try not to use it much because I think it's important to be very personal in music, but I think it's a great aid to help navigate your creative process when it's in the beginning stages.

AI: That's a really thoughtful balance you've struck - using it strategically in those early brainstorming phases while preserving the personal elements that are so crucial to music. You mentioned being mindful not to use it too much because of the importance of keeping music personal.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Music and art are something that is so human and personal, and I am worried that AI will start to generate music and that people will start to lose that personal aspect to it that makes music so wonderful. Every human experience is different and felt differently, therefore making art and music such an impactful thing. Artists are able to encapsulate their feelings into words and music, and I'm fearful that we'll eventually start losing that.

AI: That's such a profound concern - the idea that we might lose that deeply human element that makes music so moving and connective. The way you describe artists encapsulating their unique human experiences really gets to the heart of what makes music powerful.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would like to think I'd keep my stance with not overusing it and only trying to use it as an aid rather than something to completely generate beats or lyrics. I think I would use it the way I use it now, and just try to combine my own ideas.

AI: That's a really clear vision - maintaining AI as a creative aid rather than a creative replacement. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your music-making process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you navigate those moments when you have too many ideas swirling around, and your commitment to preserving the deeply personal aspects that make music so human and impactful.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I believe we covered a good amount of information.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative compass while maintaining the personal authenticity that makes music so powerful will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your workflow - that balance between leveraging its organizational capabilities while preserving the deeply human elements of your art. Best of luck with your music projects!
