Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes. No

AI: Perfect, let's get started then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to learn how to use a tool faster. Sometimes I use it for ideas. Mostly, I use it for problem-solving. Tasks can be related to:
 code generation or bug fixes on my own code. 
rewriting my text to fit a specific tone and audience or to be better in general
reviewing my writing
general questions related to the platform I'm working on and how it works if i want to achieve something
providing sample drafts of written content
teaching me how to use a tool, feature or plug-in in a platform
generating sample data like answers to questions

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses. I'm curious about the problem-solving aspect you mentioned - can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? What kinds of problems do you typically bring to AI?

User: I bring the problems that I'm stuck on and I'm in a crunch of time to find the solution. The problems do not have to be complex per-se but the time I'm provided to solve the problem is not sufficient for me to solve it without the help of AI. An example is I recently finished a 1 week and a half training on a specific Power Platform and by the next week I was expected to start creating solutions that had a week or 2 weeks deadlines. Meaning, I had to leverage AI when I was stuck, after trying to search for the solution online, I found a solution but it deprecated since the technology is updated so often so I was pushed to use AI to help me solve the problem I had in hand at the time.

AI: That's a really specific example - it sounds like you were in a situation where the technology was moving faster than the available documentation. When you're in those time-crunch situations like with the Power Platform, how do you typically interact with AI? Are you working back and forth with it to solve the problem step by step, or do you give it the full problem and let it handle it?

User: I explain the problem extensively. I sometimes explain my solution approach to get refined so i'm not stuck anymore or I let the AI provide me with it's solution which I test out against mine. If the AI's solution is worse than mine then I go with the former approach. While testing the AI's solution, if that raises issues I bring it up to the AI to solve. I would do this multiple times to get the AI's solution to work. But if it hits a road block then I realise the Ai's solution is worse than mine, then I would start a new conversation with the AI with the same intial problem but this time I'll provide my solution so the AI works on improving my solution.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - you're really treating AI as a collaborative problem-solving partner rather than just a tool. It sounds like you have a pretty sophisticated system for evaluating when to stick with AI's approach versus pivoting back to your own.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: AI could write and respond to all my emails but it sounds so rigid and robotic no matter what I do so I prefer to write my own emails and only use AI to help with grammar and punctuation but not the content of the email itself because I would need to spend more time changing the AI written email to sound like me than it would take for me to write the email with no AI help.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like authenticity and your personal voice are really important to you in communications. The time trade-off you mentioned is interesting too.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: My workplaces are pro AI. I was already pro AI so I have not been influenced one way or another. However, I did learn to turn to AI as a last resort in the process of problem-solving and only when I'm stuck with insufficient time to get the work done properly. So despite some workplaces being pro AI some colleagues suggest to use it completely from the get go but others suggest to use it only as a last resort.

AI: That's really interesting - so even in pro-AI workplaces, there are different philosophies about when and how to use it. It sounds like you've settled on the "last resort when stuck and time-pressed" approach.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I usually feel more frustrated than satisfied when using AI at work to solve a niche problem. It's usually when I tell the AI the solution they have provided results in errors, doesn't work as they have described, doesn't solve the problem, or can't work at all because it suggested parameters that don't exist or are deprecated. There are many examples.

AI: That frustration sounds really familiar - especially when AI suggests parameters that don't even exist anymore. You mentioned you usually feel more frustrated than satisfied - can you think of a time when AI did work out well for you? What made that experience different?

User: AI has worked well numerous times on mundane simple tasks like generating a sample draft of question related to a particular topic. But even those outputs require manual tweaking to be almost perfect in my opinion. It's difficult for me to recall getting an AI output that I trust 100% and don't need to adjust it with my ideas or follow up with another question to the AI to make the output better.

AI: That's really revealing - it sounds like even when AI works well, you're always in an editing or refinement mode. You mentioned not trusting AI outputs 100% - how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't particular care about AI taking over on my skill areas. My non-technical coworkers used a particularly famous AI to adjust their plain HTML webpage code to remove a paragraph from a column (inner div) and have the paragraph formatted outside the column as a stand alone portion of the webpage. The 2 coworkers spent a lot of time with that AI trying to fix this issue but it could not get it done despite the code being fed to the AI to edit it. The coworkers explained this entire situation to me and asked me if i could solve their problem. I could, since it was a really simple fix and I got it done in 2 minutes after locating where the right parts that need to be changed are. I think AI is good but if it can't actually help non-technical people solve a problem as simple as that, there's nothing for me to worry about. (The irony here is i had used that particular AI to solve more complex problems than the one my coworkers had and it solved them correctly about half of the times.)

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - and what an interesting contrast between AI handling your complex problems sometimes but failing on what seems like a simpler HTML task for your colleagues. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your current approach will change?

User: I'm not sure what the future holds. I hope the AI gets smarter so I can rely on it more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your systematic approach to problem-solving with AI - how you test its solutions against your own and know when to pivot back to refining your original approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative problem-solving partner, the importance of maintaining your authentic voice, and that interesting example about the HTML task will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
