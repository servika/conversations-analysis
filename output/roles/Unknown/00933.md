Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good and no

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help manage our team's email inboxes every day. We use it to help filter and send 1000s of emails where they really go each day. 

I also use AI to feed data and have it cleaned and parsed. An example is I might have a data file of 30 days' worth of deliveries with customer timing and volume and I load it into AI systems to help me determine how many unique deliveries there are and how many pieces there are on average. 

I also use AI to help me tweak my labor hours for driver planning based on the time and miles from the previous month. I feed the raw data and then have it give me recaps and planning. Most of what I am using AI for is taking excel and CSV files and manipulating the data.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI quite heavily for data processing and operational tasks. 

When you're working with these CSV files and Excel data, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Are you feeding the raw data to the AI and getting back a finished analysis, or is there more back-and-forth involved where you're guiding the AI through the analysis step by step?

User: yes, typically i pull the file out of our dispatch system and then upload into the LLM  along with clarifying statements so the model knows exactly what I need for it to do for me. Sometimes I need to know how many uniques stops we had, avg times, avg pieces, etc. 

most of the time I feed and get finished product but sometimes I have to tweak to get the end result I need

AI: That's helpful context. When you mention having to "tweak to get the end result you need" - what does that usually involve? 

Are you typically adjusting your instructions to the AI, or are you taking the AI's output and modifying it yourself, or something else entirely?

User: I am adjusting my instructions to get the AI to make changes to the data

AI: Got it - so you're refining your prompts to guide the AI toward the analysis you need.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: The only issue I have had is when I need the AI to generate an excel sheet or a JSON and it says it gave to me but only provides a sample

AI: That's a concrete frustration - when you need the full dataset but only get a preview. 

Beyond that technical limitation though, are there parts of your work - maybe decision-making, planning, or other aspects - where you prefer to keep control rather than involving AI? What drives those choices for you?

User: No, I am all about putting everything into AI that I can. I was able to reduce my staffing by 3 people in my call center by using AI to distribute tasks

AI: That's a significant operational change. When you reduced staffing by 3 people through AI implementation, how did that process unfold? 

Were your colleagues and workplace generally supportive of integrating AI so extensively, or did you encounter any resistance or concerns along the way?

User: At first some resistence because people don't trust what they don't understand but once they saw how it could save them time and endless opening and forwarding emails they started udnerstanding that this was a much better way

AI: It sounds like seeing the practical benefits helped shift their perspective. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated - I was working on a project where I needed to have AI look up the pharmacy opening hours for about 300 pharmacies in Houston. This activity would save a person 8-10 hours of work and it has worked for me in other cities and it did not work - it kept giving me hours of the main store and not the pharmacy inside the store and we wasted 2 hours trying to get it to work and ended up doing it ourselves

AI: That's a frustrating experience - especially when you've had success with similar tasks before and expected it to work. It sounds like the AI couldn't distinguish between the main store hours and the specific pharmacy department hours within those stores.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI made you feel particularly satisfied with the results?

User: I needed to take some LTL store drops and figure out where the pool points should be based on grouping delivery addresses and the AI was able to group stores together for me and tell me where induction points should be

AI: That sounds like it saved you significant planning time and probably improved your delivery efficiency too.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI is now handling a lot of the work? For instance, with all the data analysis AI is doing for you - is this something you actively consider, or do you see it differently?

User: I don't worry about it because I am not able to focus more on financial improvements elsewhere that I wasn't able to get to before. My hope is to move it into AI and then onto the next area for me to work on. i hope to keep moving tasks to AI

AI: That's an interesting perspective - using AI to free yourself up for higher-level work rather than worrying about losing skills in the automated areas.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you and your operations?

User: I will continue to grow the relationship. I am working on integrating AI into load planning and route optimization in the next few months

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a way to continuously move up the value chain - automating current tasks so you can focus on new areas for improvement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think AI is great at writing documents, processing data, and helping improve resumes, but hasn't been great at operations and planning for warehousing. More in that area woudl be great

AI: That's a valuable insight - the distinction between AI's current strengths in document creation and data processing versus its limitations in operational warehouse planning. Thank you for pointing that out.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about large-scale AI implementation, the change management process with your team, and the specific operational challenges you've encountered will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and the frustrations - that balanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the real-world experience of working with AI tools.
