Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds wonderful I have no questions yet.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my work I like to use AI for simple tasks that would be time consuming for me but easy for an AI model. I also use it to give me ideas and create a basis for me

AI: That's a great start - it sounds like you're being strategic about where AI fits best. 

When you mention using it to "create a basis" for you, can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? What kind of foundation does AI help you build?

User: When I'm lacking creativity I use AI to supplement it and have it list ideas that give me a general idea of how to build an activity or lesson plan

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI as a creative springboard when you hit those blocks. 

Can you walk me through what happens after AI gives you those initial ideas? Do you typically take one and run with it, or do you find yourself mixing and matching different suggestions?

User: Usually I only use the suggestions as a sort of inspiration. I try to draw out different aspects of the idea and make it into my own rather than relying on AI to create the idea and then execute it

AI: That's a fascinating approach - you're clearly being intentional about maintaining your own creative ownership. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes there's definitely tasks that I prefer to do myself even though AI could them easier. Tasks that I find fun or tasks that I want to busy my time with rather than doing nothing usually end up being done by me rather than AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - choosing to do tasks because they're enjoyable or help fill your time, rather than just optimizing for efficiency.

Can you give me an example of a specific task that falls into that category? Something you find fun or want to spend time on, even when AI could handle it?

User: Well my work requires me to survey my kids and analyze their responses through salesforce and I could probably make that easier on myself through AI but I enjoy the personal feeling of going through those surveys and reading them thoroughly

AI: That's a really meaningful example - there's something personal and valuable about that direct connection with your students' feedback that you don't want to lose to automation.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to work through problems with it and sharpen the responses of the model so that it better matches what I'm looking for. It ends up being a lot of "here's more details could you make your response reflect these details".

AI: That back-and-forth refinement process sounds like a real collaboration - you're actively shaping the output together rather than just taking what it gives you initially.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing AI use with others, or is it more of an individual choice?

User: My work is actually really AI friendly and its a more progressive foundation and tries to keep with the times and create a positive work environment. As a result AI is typically used by my peers and me

AI: It sounds like you're in a really supportive environment for AI adoption - that's not something everyone has.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Some AI models have a hard time understanding complex issues in the financial space and that has made me frustrated as it can lack fundamental aspects. Most of the time I try to only delegate simple tasks to it and that usually works out well.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about AI's limitations in specialized domains like finance. It sounds like you've learned to work within those boundaries.

When you hit those frustrating moments where AI misses fundamental financial concepts, how do you typically handle it? Do you try to educate the model, or do you just shift to handling those complex issues yourself?

User: Sometimes I'll educate the model in hopes that my response has some impact on it, however small that may be, but most the time I just don't have the time or patience really.

AI: That makes complete sense - there's a real cost-benefit calculation there between the time it takes to educate versus just doing it yourself.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't really have to worry about that because my main skill set is something that requires the human aspect and people wouldn't turn towards AI for its main component.

AI: That's reassuring to feel that secure in your role's human-centered nature.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future, or are you pretty settled into your current pattern?

User: I think I have a good system and I don't feel the need to change it, however times change and likely my use of AI could change along side it. I find it important to understand that saying never often makes you wrong.

AI: That's a wonderfully balanced perspective - being content with what works now while staying open to change.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found that sweet spot between leveraging AI for efficiency while preserving the human elements that matter most to you, like reading through your students' surveys personally.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between AI assistance and maintaining the human touch - especially in education and working with students - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were about describing your approach. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
