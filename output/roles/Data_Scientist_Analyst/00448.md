Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me, let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a data analyst at SUEZ and I use AI for a variety of things daily. Most common is when I'm coding for Excel , VBA , Power Query M or Dax. It saves a lot of time because it speeds up repetitive / tedious coding a ton. But I use it for other tasks as well. I have to prepare slide decks for meetings often and the narrative /tone that needs to be set can vary. AI can help create concise yet effective text for these slide decks. I also use AI for typing emails for the same reason, it's useful for going for a specific tone whilst still being concise

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI is touching several different aspects of your work. You mentioned using it for coding, slide decks, and emails, all with this focus on efficiency and tone.

When you're working on those coding tasks - the Excel, VBA, Power Query M, or DAX - can you walk me through what that interaction typically looks like? Are you asking AI to write entire functions, or is it more of a back-and-forth process?

User: Yes , I often tell it to write the entire code for a certain task. Other times, I'll provide it with some code I already have and then ask AI to modify it to do something additional or just to optimise it. Often for more complex tasks, AI will struggle to code it so I will manually walk through it step by step with the AI, providing clarifications along the way

AI: That's interesting - so you've developed different approaches depending on the complexity. For those more complex tasks where you have to walk through it step by step with AI, providing clarifications along the way, what does that process feel like for you? 

Is that collaborative back-and-forth something you find valuable, or would you prefer if AI could just handle those complex tasks independently from the start?

User: I'd prefer if AI could handle it independently from the start. After all, the goal is efficiency and speed.  However collaborating usually isn't a bad experience, I do find it impressive and amusing how AI takes my corrections into account and seems to "learn" as we go along.

AI: That's a great observation about AI seeming to "learn" during your interactions. You mentioned that your main goal is efficiency and speed - I'm curious about the other side of that coin.

Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes , for super sensitive information, like budgets and other financial areas, I do them without AI. Any sort of mistake cannot be afforded for work in the Finance department, and AI is quite prone to errors, especially when it comes to Maths. I also don't use AI for any work where confidential information is involved. Technically, AI says it doesn't save the data you give it other than in your cookies, but I don't believe that.

AI: That makes complete sense - the stakes are clearly different when you're dealing with financial data and confidential information. You mentioned AI being prone to errors, especially with math, which is particularly problematic in finance work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture at SUEZ influenced the way you use AI? Do you find that others share similar boundaries, or are there different approaches across your team?

User: I am the only person who really uses AI. I work as the sole data analyst on the team. It's generally a very hands-on office. There is of course a ton of computer usage, but it's all just using Excel documents and a few websites.

AI: Interesting - so you're essentially pioneering AI use in your workplace. Being the only one using these tools in what sounds like a more traditional, hands-on environment must create a unique dynamic.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It makes me feel satisified on a daily basis. It helps me create things or discover features I would not have known otherwise. Like when it taught me about the Filter function in Excel, which allowed me to create an automated stock management system .

AI: That's a perfect example - discovering the Filter function and using it to build an automated stock management system sounds like a significant breakthrough. It sounds like AI isn't just helping you work faster, but actually expanding your capabilities and knowledge.

You mentioned this happens on a daily basis. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't believe AI could take over anytime soon. It requires a ton of hand holding, often even for relatively simple tasks. We're already at Chat GPT 5, and it's still this dependent on user help.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - you're seeing firsthand just how much guidance AI still needs, even with the latest versions. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops, or do you think your current approach will largely stay the same?

User: I think I will continue to use it as I do. As a learning tool and an optimisation tool to save time

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the sole AI user in a hands-on workplace, and how you've developed clear boundaries around sensitive financial data while still finding daily value in AI as a learning and optimization tool.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I believe that covers the breadth of my AI usage at work.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a data analyst - from the practical coding applications to the trust considerations with financial data, and especially your perspective on AI's current limitations despite being an early adopter in your workplace - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your daily experiences with such detail. Have a great rest of your day!
