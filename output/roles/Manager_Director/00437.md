Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI fits into my typical workday by helping me collect data, brainstorming, new communication ideas, project management, and instructions for complex excel needs.

AI: That's a nice range of applications. I'd love to hear more specifics about how you actually use AI for these tasks. 

Can you walk me through what it looks like when you use AI for data collection? What kind of data are you gathering and how does the AI help with that process?

User: I have spreadsheets with an array of information. AI helps organize the data differently or provide information when I ask specific questions from the spreadsheets.

AI: That's helpful context. Tell me more about what happens when you ask AI specific questions about your spreadsheet data. Can you give me an example of the type of question you might ask and what kind of response you're looking for?

User: Recently, we had an event where we had to match names to tabling topics. I asked AI to categorize the students within the tabling topics they chose.

AI: That sounds like a practical use case. When you had AI categorize the students by their tabling topics, what did that process actually look like? Did you upload the spreadsheet and ask it to reorganize everything, or did you work through it step by step together?

User: I uploaded the spreadsheet, but reviewed the AI results.

AI: That's interesting - so you used AI to do the initial categorization work but then reviewed what it produced. What were you looking for when you reviewed those results? Did you find things you needed to correct or adjust?

User: I wanted to ensure the students were in their correctly chosen tables. Also, I wanted to make sure the students were evenly distributed throughout the table topics.

AI: So you were checking both for accuracy and for balance across the tables. When you found issues - maybe uneven distribution or students placed incorrectly - how did you handle those adjustments? Did you make the changes yourself or go back to AI for help with the fixes?

User: I made the changes myself.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned making those final adjustments yourself rather than asking AI to rebalance things. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Sometimes I just prefer to conclude the task myself because I might have different preferences that AI, of course, does not know about it.

AI: That makes sense - you have context and preferences that AI wouldn't know about. Can you tell me more about what those preferences might be? For example, in that student tabling situation, what kinds of considerations were you thinking about that AI wouldn't have known?

User: Just because I know what certain students might prefer in tabling over their overall 4 chosen table topics.

AI: Ah, so you have personal knowledge about individual students that helps you make better placement decisions. That's really insightful.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you often have AI do an initial pass and then you refine things - is that generally how you work with it, or do you sometimes collaborate with it throughout a task differently?

User: I like AI to do a pass or three before I take over and refine the task.

AI: So you let AI take multiple passes before you step in - that's interesting. Tell me about those multiple passes. Do you give AI feedback between each pass, or do you let it work through several iterations on its own before you jump in?

User: I do give AI feedback.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or do you approach it differently than your coworkers?

User: I think many in the workplace use it quite often for many areas of their tasks. I use it as needed or when I am trying to quickly finish a task to meet a deadline.

AI: So it sounds like AI use is pretty common in your workplace. You mentioned using it when you need to finish tasks quickly for deadlines - can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes I ask AI to count things, but it can get confused with tables within a spreadsheet. So, I have to ask it different or for clarification.

AI: That sounds frustrating when you need quick counts but have to go back and forth for clarification. Tell me more about what happens in those moments when AI gets confused with your spreadsheet tables. How do you usually work through that confusion to get what you need?

User: I just add a bit of detail so AI can focus on what I am asking for.

AI: That makes sense - providing more specific guidance to help AI focus. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or do you approach it differently?

User: I approach it differently. I have a heavy English background, but I am not worried about AI taking over. I still think it's important for emails, messages, and other areas of writing to sound organic over perfect with big words.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - valuing organic communication over perfection. It sounds like your English background gives you confidence in areas where AI might help others.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll use it more, differently, or keep it about the same as now?

User: For now, I think I will keep it the same.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on keeping writing organic rather than perfect, and how you use your personal knowledge of students to make better decisions than AI could on its own.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point while maintaining your own judgment and expertise will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
