Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Content creation such as newsletters and social media posts. I also use it for email drafts and to double check any work I have done for improvements/grammatical errors.
I have also used it to create elements of business plans, helping me to plan out next steps, generate new ideas for products etc.

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses. You mentioned using AI for content creation like newsletters and social media posts, but also for checking your own work for improvements and errors.

When you're working on something like a newsletter, do you find yourself collaborating back and forth with the AI throughout the writing process, or do you tend to give it a complete brief and let it handle the task independently?

User: I would normally give it a brief to being with, but then I may collaborate if I feel there any changes that need to be made.

AI: That makes sense - starting with a brief and then refining as needed. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yeah, when emailing existing clients I would definitely take on the writing for myself. Mostly because I want to know exactly what has been said and also each one is slightly different, so I do not feel there is much time saving if I have to coach the AI each time. That said I will use it to check for grammatical errors etc.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - keeping control of existing client communications because of the relationship aspect and the individual nuances each email requires. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Crafting social media captions. I hate trying to do it, so I feed it content that I like that other people have done and use it to create similar things for us, but specific to our product.

AI: That sounds like a perfect match - taking something you really don't enjoy doing and having AI handle the creative heavy lifting while you guide the direction.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has their approach affected how you think about using these tools?

User: I don't have colleagues as I am the owner/operator. However, I guess you could say that has influenced me to use AI more as it saves me time that I can then make use of elsewhere.

AI: That's a great point - being a solo operator definitely changes the calculus. You have to be strategic about where you spend your time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really concern you?

User: It doesnt really concern me. My main job is roasting and packing coffee so I do not see this being taken over completely by AI any time soon as it is too hands on. I could see how it could aid the coffee roasting side in the future though.

AI: That's fascinating - so you're in coffee roasting! That hands-on, sensory aspect definitely seems like something that would remain very human-centered.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different tasks as time goes on?

User: I could see myself using it for more marketing tasks if there were specialised versions for, paid ads etc. I could also see it taking on some of the roasting once its underway as we use tracking software that can make the changes to temperature etc. so if it was integrated into that.

AI: Those are really interesting possibilities - specialized marketing AI and integration with your existing roasting tracking software. It sounds like you're thinking about AI as potentially enhancing the technical precision side of roasting while you maintain the craft expertise.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found ways to use AI for the tasks you don't enjoy, like social media captions, while keeping direct control over the relationship-critical work like client emails.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thats all thanks.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you strategically use AI as a solo business owner - especially that balance between leveraging it for tasks you don't enjoy while maintaining personal control over client relationships - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: No problem.

AI: Thanks again! Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your coffee roasting business!
