Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm ready!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I prefer to use it for the more menial tasks I do like creating invoices, writing generic emails to clients, or organizing client lists/bookkeeping. This leaves me time to do the creative part myself.

AI: That's interesting - you mention saving time for the creative parts. What kind of work do you do, and what are those creative aspects that you prefer to handle yourself?

User: I make technical illustrations for clients. These are often fashion related. There is almost always some form of creative license I get to take when making the illustrations in terms of decision making and how the packs will be structured. Sometimes clients communicate their vision with me and want me to fill in the gaps myself. Apart from the actual illustrating and consults, I also like to do research on the clients myself before I reach out or they reach out to me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's real artistic judgment involved in those decisions. You mentioned you like to do client research yourself rather than having AI handle it. What draws you to keeping that research process in your own hands?

User: In this industry there are a lot of niche areas, so I search for clients whose products fit work I've done or want to get into. In cold contacting, I would say being able to show potential clients a portfolio with hyper-relevant work, not just any work, is the biggest indicator for landing that client. For potentials that contact me first, I also like to research them to make sure their vision fits my capabilities. Connections and word-of-mouth are important, so taking work I know suits my skillset is something I prioritize.

AI: That strategic matching sounds crucial for your business success. When you do use AI for those more routine tasks like invoices and client emails, how do you typically work with it? Do you collaborate back and forth during the process, or do you tend to give it the task and let it handle it completely?

User: I usually use AI to help me draft up emails by giving it a prompt and uploading my mailing list for it to insert each company's name into the email. I upload the excel sheet of my clients and profits for it to do calculations about my earnings for me. If I knew how, I would love to be able to give the AI the names of the company's and have it find me their business emails for me, and even automate the process of sending out the emails in gmail. I also wish I knew how to have it automatically track the bookkeeping stuff. I would say whenever I utilize AI at the moment, I'm only able to half-automate the tasks.

AI: So it sounds like you're delegating specific pieces but then manually handling the connections between those pieces. You mentioned wanting fuller automation - like having AI find business emails and actually send the emails through Gmail, or automatically track bookkeeping. What's holding you back from setting up that level of automation? Is it more about technical know-how, or are there other considerations?

User: I guess I don't know which programs would fit what I need and how much they would all cost. With cost I don't know that it would be worth it for me.

AI: That uncertainty around cost and tools makes sense, especially when you're weighing the investment. How have your colleagues or others in your industry influenced the way you think about using AI in your work? Are other illustrators talking about it, or are you mostly figuring this out on your own?

User: I've been figuring it out on my own!

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. I found it really informative when I used Ai to do my business analytics (I uploaded several spreadsheets containing data like program costs, income, client lists, potential client lists, etc). I was able to see trends for the whole year and compare it to previous years. I was able to see my financial trends plus my client success rates and retention rates.

AI: That sounds like it gave you some valuable insights into your business patterns! What specifically made that experience feel so informative - was it seeing data you hadn't noticed before, or was it more about how the AI presented the analysis to you?

User: Both. Being able to see the data presented visually/graphically allowed me to notice trends I hadn't before.

AI: That's a powerful combination - new insights plus a clearer way to see patterns. As you think about the future, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Are there new ways you'd like to work with it, or areas where you think you'll continue to keep it at arm's length?

User: I think I'd only like to include AI more in my work in the ways I discussed earlier. That is, fully automating tedious tasks that have to do with the business part to allow me to fully dedicate my energy and time to the creative part of my job. I could see that allowing me to improve my skills faster and complete more actual projects in less time. I can say almost certainly that I wouldn't want AI involved in the actual creation process for me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between wanting full automation for business operations while keeping the creative process entirely in your hands - that strategic approach to preserving what matters most in your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can support creative professionals by handling administrative tasks while preserving the core creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
