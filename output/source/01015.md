Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI a lot. I'm a blogger who ghostwrites for others, so depending on the platform I'm using I might use it to automatically generate alt text for images (which I then edit). I also perform research for clients, and while I don't intentionally search with AI the search engine I use sometimes has an AI summary at the top. I will sometimes use this as a starting point for information gathering, but I always doublecheck and do my own research.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI touches your work in more subtle ways rather than being a central tool. 

When you mention editing the automatically generated alt text, what typically needs to be changed? What makes you feel the need to edit it rather than just using what's generated?

User: When the image has a watermark (usually the name of the photographer or photography business) the AI will often include that in the alt text. It also tends to describe the mood of the image, but not in a very natural way. For example, it might say something like, "Infant girl asleep in antique wicker basket against a white backdrop. Peaceful and serene mood." And then the text from the watermark. I also sometimes add location-specific information for my clients for SEO purposes. So I might change the text to say, "Infant girl sleeping peacefully in antique wicker basket in photography studio in San Francisco."

AI: That's a really concrete example of how you're actively shaping the AI output to serve your clients better. You're catching those technical quirks like watermarks being included and making the language more natural.

Tell me more about the research side - when you see those AI summaries at the top of search results, what draws you to use them as a starting point versus just diving straight into the individual sources?

User: Most of my clients are photographers, so a lot of times I'm searching for a roundup of information. Like, "must-haves for your baby registry" or "most popular colors for baby girl newborn sessions." Going through a dozen or so blog posts one by one is a bit time-consuming, so the AI summary is a way for me to quickly see that, for example, pink, white, and purple apparently show up frequently as popular colors for baby girls. I can doublecheck that information fairly quickly with a few searches on Instagram or baby blogs, and then personalize it for my client. For example, maybe those are the most popular colors, but my photographer has also mentioned a lot of parents choosing sage green for newborn girls at her studio, so I would mention that as one of the top colors in her blog post, and maybe a few suggestions for using a surprising choice for a baby girl, like navy blue.

AI: That's a really smart approach - using the AI summary to spot patterns across multiple sources quickly, then validating and personalizing it with your expertise about each client's specific situation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do prefer to do all of the writing myself, even though I know AI could do it a lot quicker. For me, this is largely an ethical choice. I don't feel right about charging my clients for content that I didn't create myself. Also, I've put a lot of time and effort into honing my written communication abilities, and I don't want to lose those skills. I think overusing AI could easily cause dependency and skill regression, and I prefer not to go down that path.

AI: That ethical dimension is really compelling - the idea that charging clients for AI-generated content wouldn't feel right to you. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm not sure I've had a work experience with AI that I would describe as particularly satisfying or frustrating. Like I said, AI doesn't play a huge role in my work. I have appreciated that the AI alt text generator built in to some blogging platforms allows me to give my clients a bit more value for their money. I usually include alt text on only a set number of images per post because it's time-consuming to come up with it and some clients add dozens of images to their posts. It would take me longer to write alt text on those than to write the article! Anyway, if clients exceed the limit then either they don't get alt text on those images or they can pay an additional fee to have me add alt text to the remaining images. Since the AI generator speeds up the process I'll often add alt text on a few extra photos without any additional charge.

AI: That's a great example of how even limited AI use can create tangible value - you're able to give clients more for the same price because the tool saves you time on a specific task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're a ghostwriter, I'm curious about how other writers or your clients talk about AI, if at all.

User: I really haven't heard much from other writers or my clients about AI

AI: When you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over, is this something you actively consider? You mentioned not wanting to lose your writing abilities - how do you think about that balance?

User: I've definitely considered offering cheaper packages to clients with the caveat that they're AI-assisted, and continuing to charge my current prices for fully human-generated content. I'm not sure if I like that idea though.

AI: What makes you uncertain about that two-tier approach? What are your concerns about offering AI-assisted packages alongside your fully human-generated work?

User: I guess, with blog posts, most of my clients care more about the bottom line than about quality content. I mean, they're not hoping to win Pulitzers with these articles or anything, they just want to show up near the top of search engines. So I worry that if I start offering AI-assisted packages I would eventually lose all of my work that's fully human generated. And I'm not sure I want to feel that removed from my work and that human connection with my clients and their readers.

AI: That concern about potentially losing the human-generated work entirely makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you're worried about a race to the bottom where convenience wins out over that personal connection you value.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself maintaining these current boundaries, or do you think your approach might shift over time?

User: For the most part I see myself maintaining my current boundaries

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the ethical considerations around charging clients for AI-generated content and your concern about maintaining that human connection with your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's it, thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the subtle ways AI can add value while maintaining professional integrity will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you have a great rest of your day!
