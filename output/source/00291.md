Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I don't have any questions. Let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually will use AI in a couple of situations. Now that it's integrated into my IDE, I will ask it general questions about syntax for languages I'm less familiar with. But this is something I could get from StackOverflow or another website too, using AI just saves me from clicking into another window. The most helpful thing I use it for is doing an analysis of large files so that I don't have to understand everything in the file to make specific changes. For instance, if I need to make a specific change to a single method in a 10k+ line file, I'll use AI to help determine where the change needs to be made, validate that location, then make the change myself (so that I can guarantee it's correctness).

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI to navigate those large codebases. When you're working with AI to locate where changes need to be made in those big files, what does that interaction typically look like? Do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI, or does it usually get you to the right spot on the first try?

User: I will usually have to go back and forth with the AI to get it to correctly understand my request or to give me a good answer.

AI: Tell me more about that back-and-forth process. What kinds of things do you find yourself having to clarify or adjust when the AI doesn't quite get it right initially?

User: I will usually provide more context, or clarify the question because I realize the AI has an incorrect interpretation of my question.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you handle the actual code changes yourself to guarantee correctness. Are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to handle anything that need to be guaranteed to be correct myself. I will usually use AI when it's an exploratory question that I can utilize AI to help explore. But when it's an actual change that will make it to production, I will not use AI, or I will specifically validate everything that AI creates and re-write it myself.

AI: That distinction between exploratory work and production changes is really clear. When you do use AI for those exploratory questions, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the exploration, or do you tend to give it a complete exploratory task to handle on its own?

User: I will collaborate throughout the exploratory process because I'm usually in a refining process where my questions are getting clearer as the exploration continues with the AI.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has any particular approaches or attitudes toward AI that have shaped how you use it?

User: No, I don't really find my team has influenced how I use it. My team and I are pretty siloed off because we have so many apps to support that we basically only work on our own things. Therefore, I'm not really 100% sure how my team uses AI at work.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was using AI to analyze a decompiled DLL to find out the implementation details of a vendor DLL. This was particularly frustrating because I couldn't navigate around the DLL quickly using dotpeek, and the AI was sending me on a wild goose chase that took time to validate. But, eventually, I was able to use the DLL internals to create a console application that gave a lot of value to our team, and implement a test suite that allowed our team to test primary functionality we hadn't previously been able to test. This was particularly reward, and I'm not sure whether or not I would have gotten to the solution without AI's help in analyzing the DLL internals.

AI: That sounds like quite a journey from frustration to a really valuable outcome. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have considered it, but I don't think AI is really going to take over any substantial portion of my job in the foreseeable future. For instance, the majority of my job is understanding business requirements and understand where to implement those requirements across the 20+ code bases our team has. This is not something AI is able to do in any substantial way. The smallest part of my job, getting the exact code into place, is something the AI is helping with, but again it can't do that by itself because it doesn't fully understand the complete context of the codebase.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will be fairly similar to what it is today. Due to the approximative nature of AI, I don't think it'll ever be trustworthy with code that has to do with payments or regulartory requirements because it doesn't have human intelligence as oversight.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you distinguish between exploratory work where AI can be helpful versus production changes where you need that human guarantee of correctness.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't have anything right now. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an exploratory partner while maintaining human oversight for critical work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
