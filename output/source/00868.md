Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds fine to me, can't think of any questions right now

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in healthcare in the public sector at middle management level, responsible for leading a team of healthcare professionals. Right now there isn't any direct AI usage in my day to day work, although some of the software we use does have some elements of AI prioritisation, although I have little to do with setting up / monitoring that. I have used AI in the past to help with transcribing meeting audio, producing meeting minutes and also helping with crafting a tricky email. I have tried to use AI to help with data analysis but have had limited success so far.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you've experimented with AI in a few different areas with varying degrees of success.

Tell me more about those experiences where you used AI for meeting transcription and email crafting. What made you decide to try AI for those particular tasks?

User: It can be very laborious to produce meeting notes, at the time, so I tried recording the meeting via my phone (meeting is in person always, never online) with the hope of using AI to trascribe the audio, this was poorly done and of limited benefit, the amount of errors / mistakes was too high, I ended up fixing a lot, it would have been better to do it myself from the start.

Regarding helping with emails, when I'm wanting to communicate something sensitive I might provide a starting suggestion and ask the AI to help refine it, make it sound more professional / tidy it up. I've also asked for suggestions which have been helpful. I do this fairly often. However, this isn't via oficial channels, I'll often do this on my own personal phone / account.

AI: That's interesting - the transcription didn't work out but the email assistance has become something you use fairly regularly. 

You mentioned doing the email work on your personal phone rather than through official channels. What drives that decision for you?

User: We have no formal support for using these technologies on official work systems, given the context of my work I'm sure you'll understand. Whenever I do share anything I ensure it's not identifiable, to protect privacy. It is something I'm very conscious and mindful of

AI: That makes complete sense given your healthcare context and the privacy considerations involved.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned trying data analysis with limited success - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes there are, as alluded to previously - anything that has any identifiable data I'll do myself, just because of the nature of my role. What I might do is make it safe to share and get assistance with certain elements of it. For example, I may ask for generic information about something I've come across (e.g. a pathology) and use the AI to quickly research and suggest a refined way forward given the scenario, helping reduce time spent manually researching.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI to gather general information while keeping the specific patient details secure.

When you do use AI for those research tasks or email assistance, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it what you need and let it handle things independently?

User: I would say there are occasionally back and forths if I'm, not happy with something or need to expand on a particular area. It very much depends on the task to be fair; refining emails is typically a single turn, the results are usually impressive. I've got used to knowing what I need to ask in the prompt to get specifically what I want e.g. I'll ask for 3 potential suggestions with varying other constraints, this helps and has become intuitive to me. With more research type prompts these often have more back and forth and follow up questions, I'll typically ask for a summary if needed also

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed quite a refined sense of how to structure your prompts based on the type of task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you discuss these tools with your team at all?

User: Some of my younger colleagues do use it in a similar manner, they're quite open about it. My older colleagues have a very cautious / dubious approach, they see it as a threat (at least that's how they come across to me). I'm sure as time progresses these tools will naturally become more adopted and integrated into day-to-day work, this takes time though, particularly in a large public organisation.

AI: That generational divide is really interesting - it sounds like you're somewhere in the middle, being thoughtful about adoption while others are either more enthusiastic or more resistant.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'd feel satisfied when I know I've saved a significant amount of time e.g. when I've asked it to do something that has just worked. It feels great and almost like cheating. Frustrated would be when I've asked it to do something but it hasn't worked properly, or I've discovered errors (usually after I've already used what it gave me!). This can be frustrating, but I'm fully aware I'm ultimately responsible, any errors are on me; I'm totally fine with that.

AI: That feeling of "almost like cheating" when it works well is really compelling - and it's clear you have a mature perspective on the responsibility aspect.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm conscious in the medium to long term my role may be under some threat, but I feel by being actively involved and interested in the development I can keep ahead of the curve but also help shape the adoption / integration. I work with poorly people, there will clearly be a need for some patient interaction by someone, so I don't feel too threatened right now, however if I was at school again I would be really mindful of the career I chose to enter, especially given the changes in AI development the past 5 years

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - seeing yourself as actively involved in shaping the adoption rather than just passively waiting for changes to happen.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see it becoming more integrated into day-to-day admin software e.g. emails / office. If this becomes official I can see it's use exploding. I'm sure it will start to be used more and more for heavy data analysis, trends and predictions, even to the point where it'll dictate changes in staffing / funding

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being actively involved in shaping adoption while staying mindful of privacy constraints, and your balanced view of both the opportunities and potential career implications.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to hear about how you're navigating AI adoption in a healthcare setting, balancing the practical benefits with important privacy considerations.

I hope you have a great rest of your day!
