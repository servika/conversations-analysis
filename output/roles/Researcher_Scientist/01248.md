Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good! I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: I can't reveal full details of such projects I have been working on yet, but I can explain that a recent project was creating a simulation of controlled navigation and optimised flight design and trajectory of a re-entry vehicle. I am also currently working on a research project on a very different project in which I am looking at modelling wildfire and understanding how topology can be incorporated into CFD simulations. Current wildfire simulations may discretise satellite imagery into a tree map and use a weather forecast, however the local wind direction varies much more on small scales than the local forecast level. This can be due to atmospheric boundary layer interactions, artificial 'wind' generated by the flames themselves, as well as topological changes such as the influence of hills and valleys. This is important to consider in wildfire simulation to refine predictions of how the fire will spread over time. It is also useful research in other fields such as understanding the spread of contaminants. I will be looking at how a topology, which could even be an extendable pattern such as for waves if we model the small perturbance of waves in the sea, impacts fluid flow, in particular for wildfire spread. Using this research, such simulations can be improved.

AI: Thank you for sharing those fascinating projects! The re-entry vehicle simulation and the wildfire modeling with topological considerations both sound like incredibly complex research areas.

Where in those processes, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm curious about any part of the workflow - whether it was in the initial literature review, setting up simulations, analyzing results, or anywhere else.

User: There are points during literature review or researching new topics or methods of interest and or relevance to the project where I have used AI to quickly synthesise information - with linked sources - in addition to simply compiling a range of sources or quick explanations on niche topics I would like to quickly gain knowledge for.

Another area is in generating 'simple' code. This means code which is not complex or describing physics, but is just functions or refactoring of code which is a menial and long task which an AI can save me time by doing.

Additionally, I use it sometimes for data presentation - if I want to adjust code for graphs to change how something is presented slightly, then AI can be great for regenerating this code. Earlier in the research, AI is also good for generating code on more obscure code libraries when running sims or wanting quick feedback - e.g. I have asked it before to format the timestep results of a simulation to show like a table in the terminal with colour indicators. It had no issue with this, but it would've taken me far too long to find out how to do this neatly, to a point where it might not even have been worth my time.

AI: That's really helpful insight into how you're integrating AI across different parts of your workflow. It sounds like you've found it particularly valuable for those more routine tasks that would otherwise eat up significant time.

For the literature synthesis you mentioned - where AI helps you quickly understand niche topics with linked sources - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that kind of research.

User: It seemed like a more sensible decision to ask the AI to quickly gather sources on the information and topic I was interested in, to summarise this information, provide sources to the papers used, and where the information was found. I can then quickly verify this information and thus the synthesis. This is much more efficient than searching through lots of papers in hopes of finding the desired information, or clunky keyword searches or 'find in page' searches, to slowly gather information. I do not use this method multiple times a day, but when I want to consider maybe a different approach or decide that a specific topic would be helpful to learn more about, then AI can be a useful tool to find all of this information quickly - like a modified searching and synthesising tool. I would like to point out that I do stress the importance of checking the information it provided and requiring it to provide its sources of information, as it is not at a point where you would trust it blindly at all.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as an efficient starting point while maintaining that verification step. I appreciate you highlighting that trust aspect.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like perhaps the core physics modeling, the CFD simulation setup, or other areas - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: AI is not fluent in maths and physics, not to that level. When making the re-entry simulation, sometimes when using AI to refactor code or quickly generate some functions, I did not realise it was working on a function or logic relating to the physics modelling. I would then often encounter a bug or strange behaviour, and trace it back to somewhere the AI had poorly modelled physics in some way in a function I hadn't realised it modified.

Regarding CFD simulation setup or intelligent domain setup or design tooling, this does seem like a really cool application of it. I just haven't tried it yet or made a setup for it to work with. In both cases it currently seems more reliable and quicker - perhaps as I'm not an expert at integrating AI with CFD software etc - to do this humanly. I feel it also keeps me more connected to the project and prevents you from losing track of the steps you are taking in the work and why each thing makes sense. It is no good for only an AI to 'understand' what is going on - the researcher must know first and foremost.

AI: That's a really insightful point about AI's limitations with physics and math - and that example of tracing bugs back to AI-modified physics functions is particularly telling. I also appreciate your perspective on staying connected to the project and maintaining that understanding as the researcher.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. When you have used AI for those areas where it works well - like the literature synthesis or the simple code generation - how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: As mentioned for the literature synthesis, I ask it to provide sources and where it located the information it used within them also. Therefore following some synthesis, I can quickly confirm the gathered information hasn't been hallucinated or misconstrued by the AI by following the links to sources and confirming.

For simple code generation, this is usually quite evident. I can gloss over the code and see it has refactored or generated in the style desired and is sensible code. Unit tests and general tests of the code also then verify there hasn't been an issue.

AI: That verification process sounds really systematic - especially requiring sources with specific locations for the literature work. 

Here's my final question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: There are many very optimistic answers that could be given here such as revealing the secrets to how I can get the data I need every time, but I'll keep things realistic.

Proven and reliable AI integration for intelligent design and modelling would be nice. Particularly in fluid mechanics, there isn't always theory to predict performance and CFD is required to observe behaviour. The researcher can then observe the results and use their knowledge to make changes. To automate this process would be amazing and be more time-efficient. This would need some carefully designed guidelines for intelligent changes to the design and it would have its own limitations probably as there would remain a level where a very experienced researcher viewing an image of the results would lead to far more insight than the AI attempting to interpret simply some numerical data and attempting to string together an explanation.

AI is already something that is being considered in projects for parameter sweep and optimisation processes in simulation, so I suppose it is mostly just taking this to the next level and further saving the time of researchers to make the work more efficient and less cumbersome.

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on maintaining that balance between AI efficiency and researcher understanding were particularly insightful. It sounds like you've found a really thoughtful approach to integrating AI where it adds value while keeping yourself firmly in control of the physics and core methodology.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, I think that covers all that we need to talk about. This was a great conversation, thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about the importance of verification processes and staying connected to the physics of your work really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific research. That point you made about how "it is no good for only an AI to 'understand' what is going on - the researcher must know first and foremost" particularly resonated.

I really appreciate the time you took to walk me through your workflow and think through these questions. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your wildfire modeling and re-entry vehicle projects!
