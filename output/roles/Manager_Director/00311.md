Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions, please continue.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to review controversial, difficult, or specific communication needs such as emails or presentation preparation.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned using AI for controversial or difficult communications specifically. Tell me more about that. What makes those situations feel like a good fit for AI assistance?

User: AI is good at offering alternative ways to state or communicate key points and can also offer guidance on the structure of a conversation to help make the points connect in a fluid way to prevent hard transitions.

AI: That makes sense - having those alternative phrasings and structural guidance sounds really valuable for sensitive communications. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I always draft my initial thoughts with rank them in priority to the conversation or presentation. I add the necessary details that I want to make sure build the context needed behind the points. And i ask AI to review and offer suggestions on structure or presentation.

AI: So you maintain control over the content and priorities while leveraging AI for refinement - that's a clear division. It sounds like you see the initial drafting and contextualizing as distinctly yours to handle.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It's a mix of both. Around communications or refinement, it's very much a collaborator. For other tasks, such as detecting trends in date or research, deducing insights or context, I will sometimes defer the entire or initial task to AI and then review or double-check

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction - collaboration for communications but more delegation for analytical work like trend detection and research. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: None

AI: So you've developed your AI usage patterns independently. That's interesting - it sounds like you've figured out what works for you without external workplace influences.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I report often to C-suite or executive roles and it's sometimes useful to have AI double check my suggested points against relevance for people in those roles. I've found that AI isn't consistently successful in helping distill key points or reframing points to the right level of content desired for upper-level business management.

AI: That's a really specific challenge - it sounds like AI struggles with that executive-level distillation and framing. When it doesn't hit the right level, what tends to go wrong? Does it get too detailed, too surface-level, or miss the mark in some other way?

User: Again, it's inconsistent. Sometimes it does a good job at understanding the role of the intended audience and what their general careabouts would be as it relates to business projects and updates. When that happens, it ignores the primary goal of it's involvement and just retains the same level of detail as originally prompted and just rephrases it. There are also times when it makes assumptions of the desired content and fails to remain focused on the provided prompt and halicunates details or data to it's inferred point that wasn't in the original prompt.

AI: That inconsistency sounds really frustrating, especially when you're preparing for high-stakes communications. The hallucination issue when it infers beyond your original prompt must be particularly concerning for executive presentations.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I only see AI as a tool to improve my skills, not one to replace my skills. So I often don't think of how to maintain my skills because I put my actions and growth in new challenges over leveraging AI as a tool when performing.

AI: That's a really clear perspective - viewing AI as enhancement rather than replacement. It sounds like you prioritize pushing yourself into new challenges rather than relying on AI as a crutch.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I only hope that my relationship with AI technologies in my work matures and grows. I enjoy seeing AI capability and technology advance and hope to continue finding ways to leverage it throughout my tasks, both routine and new.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborator for communications while maintaining ownership of the content and priorities, and how you view it as a skill-enhancing tool rather than a replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaboration patterns, the challenges with executive-level communication refinement, and your approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to participate in this interview today.

User: Bye

AI: Thank you, and have a great day!
