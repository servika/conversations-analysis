Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me, the only question I have is will I have access to this conversation in the future?

AI: Yes, you'll have access to this conversation in your chat history with Claude. This interview will appear just like any other conversation you've had with me, so you can refer back to it whenever you'd like.

Great! Let's get started then. Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically speaking I'll use AI to look over my test cases to see if there's anything I may have missed. It's been especially useful for regression testing as there are no new features being fed to the AI but rather things that are already implemented and may break with new implementation. I may also use it to summarize our retrospective meetings and other adjacent department meetings that I may not understand first time around. It describes other applications and their use far better to me than say a slideshow presentation that has workflow diagrams etc

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI serves as both a quality assurance partner and a translator of sorts for you. 

Tell me more about that second role, where you use it to make sense of presentations and workflows from other departments. What is it about AI's explanations that works better for you than the original materials?

User: To be honest the fact that I can ask it to explain things without looking silly at a meeting. I can ask about any minute detail to really get a good understanding in my own time. There's no way I'd stop the flow of things to ask something like "what is a FMEA?" due to the risk of looking silly and lowering confidence in other teams that our testing's going well (this is just an example)

AI: That makes complete sense - having that safe space to ask questions without any social risk is really valuable. It sounds like AI gives you the confidence to fully understand things on your own terms.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: tasks that I like handling myself include anything I think requires creative/critical thinking and amount of importance. I wouldn't feel safe delegating things that are high priority or letting AI decide how to approach test case generation for blockers but more so with repetitive tasks. Mainly for saving time

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction - it sounds like you use importance level and the need for creative judgment as your main criteria for what to keep versus what to delegate.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: typically I'll start working by myself and when I see opportunities to save time without a big risk of something important being missed I'll delegate lower priority tasks. I always double check after though

AI: So you're taking a cautious, verification-focused approach - doing your own work first, then bringing AI in strategically, and always reviewing the results. That sounds like a very deliberate process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: my workplace is a bit behind in its usage of AI. There have been workshops on how to use it but in all honesty it feels quite dated. For example, we had a 2 hour workshop where all that was essentially established were a few "good prompts" to use and even those felt like they weren't utilizing AI properly to me. I didn't want to rock any boats though so I kept this to myself. There's one colleague whom uses it just like me but I think because most of the other staff are much older its a bit of a disconnect

AI: That disconnect sounds challenging - being more advanced in your AI usage but not feeling comfortable sharing that expertise. It sounds like you and that one colleague have found your own way of working with AI despite the workplace being slower to adapt.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: its made me feel extremely satisfied when I used it for test case generation for a simple test project where we were testing a webpage. That combined with my own exploratory testing led to some really fast defect identification.

AI: That sounds like a great example of AI amplifying your existing skills! The combination of AI-generated test cases plus your exploratory testing expertise creating that fast defect identification must have felt really effective.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I figure there'll always be a need for human input since we all have a different frame of reference, it'll always be easier to understand a stakeholder's requirements face to face than in text and with AI. Having said that though, if QA was to become redundant in 5 years time I'd be ok with that too, there'll always be something I can work on to remain competitive. In fact, I don't really see it as making us redundant, I'd see it as needed to learn how to leverage AI and evolve with it

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - you see AI as something to evolve with rather than compete against. It sounds like you're focused on adaptation rather than replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see it being used more and more, especially when other team members become more exposed to it

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using importance level and creative judgment as criteria for what to delegate, and your balanced view of evolving with AI rather than seeing it as a threat.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I'll say this, on the work side of things its great but when asking how to approach another colleague or anything feeling based it can be a bit off base. Thankfully I know better than to rely on AI for that sort of thing.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - recognizing that AI's strengths in technical tasks don't necessarily translate to interpersonal or emotionally nuanced situations. It sounds like you've developed good intuition about where AI works well and where human judgment is irreplaceable.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the strategic use of AI in testing, navigating workplace adoption challenges, and maintaining that balance between leveraging AI and preserving human judgment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: no problem, I hope that helped somehow

AI: It absolutely did! Your insights were really valuable - from the practical ways you use AI for test case review and meeting summaries, to the more nuanced observations about workplace dynamics and knowing when to rely on human judgment versus AI assistance. These kinds of real-world perspectives are exactly what help us understand how AI integration actually works in practice.

Thanks again for taking the time to share your experiences with me today!
