Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, let's start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a copywriter for a startup, and I use AI for a range of tasks.

If I'm writing something templated, like a variation on a basic weekly email that goes out to customers, I'll use AI to write me a first draft of that email each week and then I'll make my own amends. Sometimes I'll work collaboratively with AI to get a finished piece of work, asking it for specific changes and suggestions.

If I'm writing something more specific like website copy, a standalone email, or a blog, I often use AI for ideation. In these cases, I may provide information about the task at hand, the purpose, the audience, etc. and ask for ideas on how best to achieve the desired results (for example, blog topic ideas or an email outline), or I'll provide ideas, bullet points, or snippets of copy I'd like to use, and ask the AI tool to provide an outline or draft that I can then rework independently. 

I also use AI to help me rework or edit copy that my colleagues have produced, which may not be in the right tone of voice or just isn't quite working for our brand. Because I've had lots of conversations with my preferred AI tool about the brand and have uploaded documents for it to refer back to, it can often make improvements to copy that isn't hitting the mark.

AI: That's really helpful to understand your workflow. You mentioned using AI differently for templated content versus more specific pieces like website copy or blogs. 

Tell me more about what makes those tasks different for you - what drives your decision to handle the specific pieces more independently?

User: I trust in my own ability to get it right, and it when it comes to more specific content, I need it to feel unique and not AI-generated. I don't want important copy to feel like everything else that's out there - I may want it to feel more creative or innovative. Sometimes I just feel like it will ultimately take me less time to write that kind of copy independently, rather than going back and forth with AI to get it closer to how I'm envisioning it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the balance between efficiency and that unique voice. You mentioned sometimes feeling like it would take less time to write independently rather than going back and forth with AI.

When you do choose to collaborate with AI throughout a task, what does that process typically look like for you? How do you navigate those back-and-forth exchanges?

User: Sometimes the conversations can be quite long and I find myself trying to achieve a result that never comes, which is understandable if I'm trying to realise a vision but struggling to fully articulate it. Often, I do get a result I'm happy with in the end, but I do sometimes question whether it was worth the time and energy spent, and if it would have been better spent trying to work it out on my own.  Sometimes it feels like we solve one issue but then another one pops up, or a preference I'd previously stated gets forgotten about.

AI: That sounds like a familiar frustration - working toward a vision that's hard to articulate and having those longer conversations where you're not sure if you're making real progress.

Can you walk me through a specific example of one of those longer conversations? What was the task, and what kept you going back and forth?

User: I was working on some website copy and felt stuck on a particular section, so asked AI for help to try and get past the creative block. I sent a screenshot of the page and specified which copy needed to change and how, and the overall messaging I was trying to achieve. It was split into 4 sections and each one had a subheading, heading, and block of text. Though I'd specified this and it was visible in the image, the AI tool kept only providing one heading, and when I asked for subheading ideas, it would just replace the heading already provided. Eventually I managed to make it understand, but then there was a lot of back and forth about specific language and alternatives to certain words or phrases that I didn't like.

AI: That's a great example of how those communication breakdowns can happen - the AI missing the structure you needed, then the iterative process on the language itself.

When you're in those moments where it feels like you're solving one issue but another pops up, or previous preferences get forgotten, how does that affect your experience? What goes through your mind during those exchanges?

User: It feels frustrating and like I'm spending too much time on the task, or perhaps spending too much time trying to use AI to solve the problem when I'm ultimately capable of fixing it myself.  Once you're already in one of those long exchanges, you can get into the habit of feeling like you must consult AI for every little change that needs to be made to a piece of work. Like, "no this sentence isn't quite right, could you give me three more examples but focus on this idea instead?", rather than just coming up with your own examples.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about getting into that habit of consulting AI for every little change. It sounds like there's a kind of momentum that builds up in those conversations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about these kinds of experiences with them?

User: I haven't talked about that particular experience with them, but I've been encouraged to use AI a lot at work. In my current role, and also in previous positions at other companies, I've found that my superiors (typically CEOs) want me to use AI to "save time" and produce more content.

I find it frustrating; I think it's assumed that because I'm a copywriter, I probably don't use AI at all or would refuse to, which isn't the case. I don't like being told about the benefits of AI in my role by people who don't really understand my role or perhaps aren't aware that I already do find it useful, in the right situations. I also find it frustrating when it gets to the point where it feels like my work as a writer isn't valued, because my superiors don't really "get" copy and think it's all the same, and that AI can produce something of the same quality.

AI: That tension between how you actually use AI and how leadership perceives your relationship with it sounds really challenging. It seems like there's a disconnect between their assumptions and your real experience.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've been really frustrated in the past when I've produced some copy and a superior has pasted it into AI and asked for changes rather than just coming to me for changes. Redrafting is a normal part of the writing process and I may not always be totally aligned with colleagues on our vision for a piece of work, but I don't want to be disrespected by having my work sent back to me with AI amends, especially if I feel like the work has suffered as a result.

AI: That must feel really undermining - having your work essentially bypassed like that instead of having a direct conversation about revisions.

When that happens and you see AI-amended work that you feel has suffered, how does that impact how you think about your own skills and value in that role?

User: It makes me feel like my skills as a writer aren't valued by my colleagues, and that writing as a skill in general is becoming devalued.

AI: That sense of devaluation sounds really difficult to navigate. You mentioned earlier that you actively use AI in strategic ways - for ideation, first drafts, and editing others' work - but it sounds like there's a difference between how you choose to integrate it versus how it gets imposed on your process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think I can do a better job than AI, but I'm aware that my perception of good copy and the general public's perception of good copy are different. I wonder whether my job role will still exist in another decade and whether I should be pivoting professionally due to that risk.

AI: That uncertainty about the future must weigh on you - especially when there's that gap between what you see as quality and what might be considered "good enough" more broadly.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Are you thinking about changing how you use it, or how you position yourself professionally?

User: I think it's better to embrace AI as a tool than to shun it. I don't want to use it so much that I lose my own creativity or get out of practice, but AI will continue to develop and improve so I might as well learn to use it to my advantage. I would consider a career in prompt engineering or AI-assisted writing or editing in future, if there were more career opportunities within that space. I'd also consider a more creative writing career - I think there'd be a bit less competition from AI if I became an author rather than a copywriter (for now!)

AI: Those are thoughtful ways to think about adapting while preserving what you value about your creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your day-to-day experience?

User: I find that I'm better at getting "good" results out of AI tools than many of my colleagues or other people I know. I find it interesting that there's a bit of a skill to getting the "right" results and that output varies so much.

AI: That's a really interesting point about there being a skill to it and how much output can vary between users. You've shared some incredibly thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work - from how you strategically choose when to collaborate versus work independently, to navigating those longer back-and-forth conversations, and especially around the workplace dynamics and how leadership assumptions can create tension.

Your perspective on that gap between your perception of quality copy and broader perceptions was particularly valuable, as was your openness about the uncertainty but also pragmatic approach to adapting professionally.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
