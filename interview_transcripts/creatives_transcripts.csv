creativity_0000,"Assistant: Hi! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nice! I think I'm good for questions. Let's get into it.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Hmmm— I'm a media composer. That means I write music for film, tv, video artwork, installations, etc. I also write standalone pieces but that's much more occasional. Depending on the project I and scope I do everything from sound design to recording but my main skill is composing.

AI: That sounds fascinating - composing across so many different media formats must present unique creative challenges for each one.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI tools for brainstorming, asking quick questions about technique and theory, general admin, copywriting, emails/comms, and also business planning.

AI: Tell me more about the brainstorming part - what does that look like when you're working on a composition?

User: Oh I should mention I also use some machine learning mixing plugins like iZotope Ozone and Sonible Smart:EQ. Anyway— brainstorming is and ideation is really just a process of bouncing my ideas off a peer. Sometimes it's talking through creative blocks and trying to clarify my vision.

AI: That's really interesting - you're describing AI almost like a creative collaborator you can bounce ideas off of. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: This wasn't a client project but I've been using AI to critically analyse film scores. It's been good to get the creative thinking flowing. Basically I've been asking AI to help write out an essay on  something like the film Arrival and what made the score by Johannsson so unique.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI to help you analyze and articulate what works in other composers' music. When you're having those conversations with AI about Jóhannsson's score for Arrival, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative insights and analysis?

User: It was fun but also it helped me refine my own perspective somewhat. I was just sending through articles from the composer and suggesting other connections that might be considered.

AI: That sounds like you were maintaining a lot of creative control - using AI to help explore and refine ideas that you were already developing. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'm honestly doing a lot my ""bucket filling"" (that's what a mentor calls it). Just digging into broad topics and synthesising ideas. I don't know if these have actuated in the work yet but I imagine it's only a matter of time.

AI: That's a great way to put it - ""bucket filling."" It sounds like you're in an investment phase right now, building up this broader knowledge base that will eventually feed into your compositions. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Well certainly for composers making ""production"" music it's a big problem. I also am pretty concerned about how AI generated music might impact streaming platform saturation. The other thing that concerns me is how VOD streaming platforms might leverage AI tech along with their publishing libraries infinitely generate new music.

AI: Those are some really specific and concrete concerns about the industry landscape. It sounds like you're seeing potential threats both to composers who work in certain commercial segments and to the broader music ecosystem through platform manipulation.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I actually don't know. It'll certainly make the non-creative aspects less tedious. Hopefully it'll be able to help me refine my ideas and speed up my workflow.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI for ""bucket filling"" - that investment in broader knowledge and synthesis - and your nuanced view of AI's industry impact, from the very practical workflow benefits to the serious concerns about commercial music production and platform saturation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so. Take it easy!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Take care!"

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's do it!

AI: Great! I'm excited to hear your insights.

Let's start with the basics - could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a music producer and audio engineer. I work with clients to record and mix their original music. Many of my projects have been full productions - so, seeing the record through from demo to recording to mixing. With an overseas move coming up though, I won't have the same access to my current home studio, so I'm hoping to move towards doing more mixing projects, exclusively.

I also play guitar in a band and produce my own electronic music when I can

AI: That sounds like a really rich mix of creative work - from client collaboration to your own artistic projects. The transition to focusing more on mixing work due to your move sounds like an interesting shift.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I'm using it mostly for brainstorming out of creative blocks, and for troubleshooting or techy workflow questions.

AI: Tell me more about those creative blocks - what does that brainstorming process look like when you turn to AI?

User: So for example - when songwriting, I'm usually more instrument-first. That is, it works best for me to write full instrumentals in the DAW first, then add lyrics. Sometimes, when it comes time to add lyrics, I'll ask ChatGPT or Claude for lists of interesting word pairings. Just getting a long list to try out over the instrumental often leads to finding a hook or at least a seed for a song idea.

Another one is song names. For example, I have an EP's worth (4 tracks) of instrumental electronic music. There's themes, but little to no lyrics. Again, I'll have an LLM drop a list of thematic words or pairings to get ideas flowing for song names.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI as almost a creative catalyst to spark ideas rather than generate the final content. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you worked through it?

User: Yeah so for this electronic EP. I had placeholder names for the projects, but I wanted to change a few of them. So I told ChatGPT about the themes of the tracks, and a sonic description of each song. ChatGPT already knows a lot about my projects and artist aesthetic, so it can use that info too. Then I told it the 4 working track names, what I liked, and what I didn't. We went through a few rounds of lists, but I ended up with 4 that I'm happy with

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative back-and-forth process. When you were going through those rounds of lists with ChatGPT, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what felt like it was driving the creative decisions?

User: I like to keep control of that, for sure. I have a very specific idea of what I wanted the song names to evoke. It's kind of an ""ill know it when I hear it"" thing, so I just want it to throw lots of ideas at the wall. Sometimes it's way off in the first one (often too cheesy or mystical sounds eg. ""Haunted Echoes""). I'll just tell it its being cheesy for this or that reason and eventually we get there

AI: I can really hear your creative ownership in that process - using AI as this idea generator while you maintain the final judgment on what fits your vision. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in these ways?

User: I probably spend less time brainstorming or procrastinating because it gets me started faster in that way.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like it's helping you move past that initial hurdle. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in music production more broadly?

User: Well the music production space (even pre-AI) has become flooded with a lot of snake oil software products. Everyone and their mother has a plugin company selling some sort of ""fix all"" solution to ""make your beats slap."" One of the most concerning things I've seen is new AI plugins that will assist you in the creative process by actually writing song parts. I'm not interested in that. Writing the rhythms and melodies by hand is the crucial human element. I'm much more interested in it helping with technical tasks.

I also am currently working with a client who likes to use AI for songwriting, musically. He's a singer/songwriter,  but doesn't play instruments. He sometimes makes tracks with Suno AI and writes over them. This is ok for finding a vibe, but again, I think taking *creative* direction from it is a mistake, because it robs the human creativity element that makes art interesting. Again, I'd rather it be used for technical tasks or brainstorming than for actually being any sort of creative driving force

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're drawing - between AI as a creative catalyst versus AI as a creative driver. It sounds like you see the human element in actually crafting the rhythms and melodies as essential to what makes the work meaningful.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Hopefully we see more advanced tools for technical tasks! htDemucs has gotten really good for audio stem separation, and I've heard that Ableton will be implementing stem separation in a new update. That will definitely shake up remixing/sampling in music. 

I haven't seen any AI drum editors/quantizers, or vocal editors, but that seems like it should be possible, too. I spend hours upon hours manually drum editing each song. If a machine could do that, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.

Oh, unfortunately we're going to see more fully AI-generated music, too. Spotify has already flooded their editorial playlists with ""fake"" artist profiles, taking away streams from real music that someone slaved over. That's a bummer.

AI: You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience with AI in music production. I particularly appreciated your clear perspective on maintaining human creative control while leveraging AI for brainstorming and technical tasks - and your distinction between AI as a catalyst versus a driver.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all that comes to mind for now.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming partner while keeping creative control firmly in your hands, and your vision for AI handling more technical tasks like drum editing, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you navigate that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving what you see as the essential human elements of music creation. Best of luck with your move and the transition to focusing more on mixing work!

User: Cool, can I just close this window now?

AI: Yes, absolutely! You can just close the window. Thanks again for participating in the interview - your insights were really valuable."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work is largely centred on writing SEO web content and articles, which involves using keywords to produce content that will help websites rank in search results. I also manage a small team of writers and need to regularly give updates to my manager. A typical project for me is a content request from a project manager, which will be for a specific client and requires a certain number of pages of content to be written.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're juggling both the creative writing side and the management responsibilities.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find myself increasingly reaching for AI tools, especially as time goes on and its capabilities continue to improve. I use it for everything from brainstorming topic ideas and page outlines through to feeding it prompts to generate content. I also occasionally use it for proofreading and fact checking by copying in written content to check it. Occasionally I'll also reach for AI when I have to do a presentation and need help coming up with ideas and structuring the presentation.

AI: It sounds like AI has become quite integrated across different stages of your work. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I needed to write 12 pages of content for a legal client. It's important with professional clients like these that the content is very well-written, accurate and professional. I was able to use AI for this project to craft paragraphs I could then lightly rewrite to make sound more human. I felt positive about the experience, as using AI helped me achieve a consistent tone and saved a lot of time from having to research things and write from scratch

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned lightly rewriting the AI content to make it ""sound more human."" When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Often I'll get AI to do the heavy lifting of writing the initial content, then I'll ""tidy up"", making edits to give a more human feel and remove any typical AI phrases or giveaways. I make sure all content undergoes multiple human checks, not only to ensure there are no hallucinations, but also to check for any issues with tone and style. I also make sure the prompt I start with has as much information fed into it as possible, which means ultimately I'm driving the creative decisions and simply getting AI to do what I want it to

AI: That's a really clear picture of your process - it sounds like you see yourself as directing the creative vision while AI handles the execution. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The biggest change is the time I now save and therefore a better output. I've gone from being able to produce 2000 words of polished, professional content to well over 5000 words each day

AI: That's a significant productivity increase! With that kind of change in your output capacity, what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My main concern is that one day my job might not exist if AI continues to improve and no longer needs human oversight, as it currently does. A secondary concern is that this could result in a lot of terrible AI content being produced, changing what SEO looks like

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the personal impact on your role and the broader implications for content quality in your field. 

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I can see AI's role continuing to grow larger as it continues to improve, saving further time and allowing for more work to be done than ever before. I can also see my job changing to be more of a prompt engineer rather than an SEO copywriter

AI: That's a fascinating shift you're describing - from copywriter to prompt engineer. Your insights have been really valuable, and I particularly appreciated how you described maintaining creative control through detailed prompting while letting AI handle the heavy lifting of initial content generation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing else, thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've maintained creative control while dramatically scaling your output, as well as your thoughtful perspective on both the opportunities and concerns around AI in content creation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a dance instructor and a choreographer. On a weekly basis, I am coming up with lesson plans for children who are learning tap, jazz, and ballet. The lesson plans need to be specific to those styles, the level of the students, and (at times) the theme of the week. Something else that is very important is that the lesson plans should expand upon each other- skills learned in the previous week should be reviewed and increased in difficulty. Additionally, I create a dance combination for each class and each week. This means that I create a short piece of chorography in each of the styles that are tailored to the students' level, the choreographic style I'm going for, and sometimes other factors such as the time of year. I am developing my own choreography style, which is a slow process. Lastly, over the next few weeks, I am choreographing a few pieces for the Christmas season.

AI: That sounds like such a rich and multifaceted creative practice! Between the lesson planning, the weekly combinations, and developing your own choreographic style, you're constantly creating and adapting your work.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI tools every week to help me build out the basic structure of my classes, including, but not limited to, barre warmups, stretching sessions, across the floor and center exercises, music choices, and integration of practiced steps into choreography. I also like to ask AI to give me ideas for things that I can teach my students about dance history

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI is really woven throughout different aspects of your teaching preparation. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes. Recently, I asked AI to come up with a basic lesson plan for jazz courses and then to alter the difficulty level for 3 different age groups. This made me feel much less overwhelmed. Planning so many classes each week takes so much time, which I do not get paid for (I only get paid for in-person instruction). AI has saved me so much time in this area.

AI: That time-saving aspect sounds really significant for your work situation. Tell me more about that feeling of being less overwhelmed - what was it like before you started using AI for lesson planning compared to now?

User: Before, I was spending a lot of time researching different lesson plans for each dance genre and age group. I was finding different dance syllabi on different websites and synthesizing them into ones that I would use for class. This was extrememly time consuming. AI seems to do that for me. Additionally, I am able to edit the lesson plans quickly and easily. For example, I can ask AI to make the combination more difficult or I can ask it to add more content/ time to the across the floor section of class and take it away from the barre section.

AI: That flexibility to quickly adjust and customize sounds incredibly valuable. When you're working with AI to create these lesson plans or modify them, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I'd like to think that I am driving the create decisions. I am very specific in my prompts about what I want as far as style, difficulty level, etc. If I feel that the AI model is getting off track or giving me ideas that are far off from what I am envisioning, I will redirect the model or ask if we can start over.

AI: That sense of maintaining control over the creative direction sounds important to you. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Because I am feeling less overwhelmed and anxious about the main planning portion of lesson planning, I find that I am more creative. I am able to focus more on small details. Before, I felt like I was throwing something together last minute due to anxiety and  lack of time. AI allows me to explore the possibilities more deeply.

AI: That's such an interesting insight - that by handling the foundational structure, AI actually freed up mental space for you to be more creative with the details. It sounds like it's shifted your focus from just getting something together to really exploring possibilities.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Dance is an art form that has been practiced since the dawn of time. It is distinctly human. I would hate to see a time where the art of dance becomes too uniform or ""cookie cutter"" due to the influence and use of AI. I also would hate to see choreographers use it as a crutch rather than a tool.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns about preserving the human essence and individuality in dance. When you think about that line between using AI as a tool versus a crutch, how do you navigate that for yourself? What does that distinction look like in practice?

User: I need to do a better job at navigating it myself. I plan on blocking off time to make lesson plans completely without the help of AI. In the future, I would like to get to a place where I can quickly create a lesson plan/ choreography on my own and only use AI to tweak it

AI: That goal of building your own quick creation skills first makes a lot of sense - almost like developing your foundational muscles before relying on the assistance.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see myself using it more efficiently. Additionally, I would love (and not be surprised) if AI could eventually learn my choreography style and apply that to what it tells me.

AI: That's really intriguing - the idea of AI learning and adapting to your specific artistic voice. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has freed up mental space for you to focus on the creative details, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining that balance between tool and crutch.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all. Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can actually enhance creativity by reducing overwhelm, and your thoughtful concerns about preserving the distinctly human nature of dance, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's get started

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work in production management for high end TV and film. This involves being across the entire filming process from start to finish, including hiring other creatives like camera people, costume designers, set designers, writers and editors.

AI: That sounds like a really complex role with so many moving pieces to coordinate. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: To be honest I find that AI tools are most useful for automating admin tasks, rather than as part of the creative process. They're not currently advanced enough to be really useful for script writing, on screen graphic design, or other key creative elements. They are very helpful for things like drafting memos or research into e.g. different eras of fashion for costume design, which frees up more time to focus on creative work.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found AI most valuable as a behind-the-scenes efficiency tool rather than a direct creative collaborator.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: On a recent film I worked on, we used AI to draft a formal warning letter to someone whose behaviour was not up to standard. There is no HR department on film or TV productions usually so those tasks fall to the production management team who are not necessarily HR experts, so it's helpful to use AI to draft something that has the right tone. We've also tried using it for things like generating graphics for internal comms like event invitations, but it didn't work too well for that - I haven't found an AI model that's capable of producing a document with both coherent text and strong images together yet.

AI: That's a really practical example - using AI to help with the HR side when you don't have that expertise in-house. And it sounds like you've tested the boundaries of what works and what doesn't, like with those internal graphics.

When you're working with AI on tasks like drafting that warning letter, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: A task like that isn't really creative, but I as the person using the tool to draft the letter would be in charge of the decisions on how it should be written, structured, etc. If I'm going to send something out with my name on it I need to be happy that everything is exactly how I want it. I think it would be the same for more truly creative tasks like graphic design as well, but it's harder to get the necessary level of control over AI produced images than it is for text.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - that sense of control and ownership over the final output being crucial, especially when your name is attached. And it sounds like you've found text to be more controllable than images in that regard.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: AI hasn't had that much of an impact on creative work for film and TV so far. I wouldn't say anything has hugely changed since we started using it, except that it helps save a bit of time and energy on some tasks.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like AI has been more of a subtle efficiency gain rather than a transformative force in your field so far.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I know people are concerned that it will take jobs away from freelancers eventually. Specifically the fields of editing and writing seem to be the most at risk. Personally I'm not sure an AI will ever be able to capture the same unique creative perspective that a human could have because it necessarily has to rely on data that already exists, which makes me think it would struggle to come up with something new. It also doesn't have lived human experience to draw on to create meaningful, emotionally impactful stories. That being said, it could be used to create lower quality ""filler"" content based on what the algorithms show is popular, which would still take jobs away from people since there is a lot of that type of streaming content being created these days. I think it will also create a higher barrier for entry for people who want to learn those trades since they'd have to develop their skills to the point that they can outcompete an AI before they can even get their first job, which may not be feasible for people from lower income backgrounds.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns, especially about the barrier to entry - that's something I hadn't considered before. The idea that newcomers would need to reach a higher skill threshold right from the start because they'd be competing with AI rather than learning alongside more experienced humans is quite significant.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it will definitely be used more for admin tasks, which will help save time and dedicate more energy to the creative work. I think it still has a long way to go before it's useful for generating visual content. I think it could have some really interesting applications in the realm of visual effects, since a lot of those are already computer generated. I imagine that if a human VFX designer could use AI tools to automate some parts of the process, it could save a lot of time and money in what is currently an expensive and time consuming process, allowing us to create more realistic looking and exciting visual effects quicker and for less money. I think this would be especially useful for modern digital production techniques like rendering vast, detailed background environments for use on LED volume stages. Tools like Cuebric are already being adopted for aligning real world performances with digitally created backgrounds, adding realism. This is the area that I think AI could be most useful in, as a new tool for skilled digital creatives to add to their arsenal, unlocking new creative opportunities.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - especially the idea of AI as a tool that could actually unlock new creative opportunities rather than just replacing existing work. The VFX and LED volume example is particularly compelling since those are already digital-heavy processes where AI could enhance rather than displace human creativity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might create new barriers to entry for newcomers in creative fields, and your vision of AI as a tool that could expand creative possibilities in areas like VFX rather than just automating existing tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it! I enjoyed getting to talk about this, thank you :)

AI: Thank you so much! I really enjoyed our conversation too. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in film and TV production were incredibly valuable - from the nuanced view of where AI helps versus where human creativity remains essential, to the broader industry implications you raised.

Your perspective on AI as a potential creative amplifier in areas like VFX, while being realistic about its current limitations, gives us a really grounded understanding of how these tools are actually being experienced by professionals in your field.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Totally. Over the past 6 months, I began to work closely with the social media side of things at my Martial Arts locations (they're sister schools). I pretty much run the show, I come up with content ideas, film, edit, generate captions/hashtags, post and even respond to comments. Right now, we're primarily focused on Meta apps (Instagram and Facebook) but I do light work on Google Business and have recently begun to integrate our reels over to TikTok. Its a lot of fun, especially because I'm always learning something. I came to this job with literally no prior knowledge besides having some of my own videos on TikTok go viral. Projects vary, as I'm always trying new things, but we do have a consistent ""Student of the Week,"" segment I prepare for all content, including OptiSigns.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic role with a lot of variety! I can see how you'd be constantly learning and adapting with all those different platforms and content types.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: All. The. Time. hahaha! ChatGPT is my best friend when it comes to caption generating. *I really hate *

AI: Tell me more about that - what is it that you really hate? I'm curious to hear where you were going with that thought!

User: My bad, I'm gonna be so honest I accidentally started italicizing my words and was trying to fix it hahahaha. I really hate coming up with captions, especially because I'm posting so many different types of content every single day between two schools. It can be very taxing, especially because I also am an instructor/manager of one location and that is my primary role. By being able to just spit out what is racing through my head and have a LLM generate the perfect captions, even adhering to shifting things slightly for different forms on content is incredible. I sometimes will go as far as hashtag generating, but I still feel like AI needs some work on that. Occasionally, I will use AI for straight up ideas, but rarely. I find in my experience AI doesn't pick up on the trends fast enough to make meaningful video ideas.

AI: That's really insightful! So it sounds like AI is most valuable to you for translating your ideas into polished captions, but you're still the one driving the creative direction and staying on top of trends.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Sure! Often, like I said previously, is I really just start spit balling out what I'm looking for in a caption. Most recently, I made a video targeted towards beginners. It was just some clips from our beginner KB class and the video read, ""POV: You're not Afraid to be a Beginner."" I really wanted that vibe to represent well in the caption, without sounding like I was making a sale, or being condescending. I used ChatGPT specifically for this. Its often my go-to. I find that when a long caption is needed, say for an Instagram Reel like I needed here, it does excellent and hits it on the money every time (Granted, I provide a lot of detail. My ADHD brain just goes lol) but it struggles to do the same for short, punchier captions. This can be frustrating when I'm on a time crunch (which I was at this time) This video in particular needed to be posted to Instagram and TIkTok, but it took 5 tries to get a caption I liked for TikTok that matched the vibe but was much more concise.

AI: That's a great example - I can really see the nuance in what you're describing. It sounds like AI excels when you can give it that detailed context from your ADHD brain, but struggles with the more condensed formats.

When you're working with AI like that - going through those 5 tries for the TikTok caption - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that back-and-forth?

User: Me, for sure. In my experience, I don't find that chatbot going out of its way to provide that type of insight. Sure, follow up questions are usually included but they're very simple, ""how's this look?"" type of stuff.

AI: That makes sense - you're clearly in the driver's seat throughout that process.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'm less stressed, honestly. It has created a ton of efficiency for me so I can focus on my favorite aspects of the job (filming and editing)

AI: That's wonderful that it's reduced your stress and freed you up for the parts you enjoy most! 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: As much as I praise AI, I do worry about the overall impact it will have. I find AI can easily replace social media managers one day, which is essentially my job and honestly my dream is to pursue it head on one day. I'm more so worried about the impact it will have on spreading false info, however. Even now you see it, a simple google search prompts an AI response and its often wrong. I don't want my work to be tainted.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the professional impact and the broader issue of misinformation. It sounds like you're experiencing this tension between AI making your current work better while also potentially threatening the field you want to pursue.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: The ultimate hope is that AI will become intelligent enough to help predict trends accurately. This will make coming up with content even easier. I'd hope if this the case, it also would have well rounded hashtag generation, and could come up with hashtags based on the apps being used, and what is generating views at the time. I think AI will playing a huge part in creating and  sustaining engagement for sure.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - AI that could essentially become your trend-spotting partner and adapt hashtags in real-time based on platform performance.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as that bridge between your racing ADHD thoughts and polished content, while you maintain creative control throughout.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think thats it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a translation tool for your creative ideas, while staying firmly in control of the creative direction, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. 

I really appreciated your honesty about both the benefits - like reducing stress and creating efficiency - and your concerns about the future impact on your field. That kind of nuanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand how AI is really being used in the wild.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your social media work for the martial arts schools!"
creativity_0006,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work spans the gamut! Some of it is simple as editing, however, my main writing projects typically take the form of a choose-your-own-adventure gamebook. So, essentially it has aspects of a long-form novel while also incorporating simple coding for the sake of branches and managing stats. Likewise, as a result, I sometimes end up creating supplementary graphics, concept art, etc, while worldbuilding.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating blend of storytelling, technical work, and visual creation! The interactive narrative format must present some unique challenges compared to linear storytelling.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Personally, I incorporate AI a lot when it comes to editing my work—spellcheck and grammar, yes, but it's nice to do some sentiment analysis and summaries so that I can make sure I'm conveying what I intend to.
When in my initial drafts, I may also brainstorm with AI in order to flesh out a scene; specific sensory details, etc. I find that by having a wide list to choose from and excluding whatever doesn't feel right, I can often tap into what it is I was truly trying to convey. Likewise, I may occasionally ask my AI to take on a particular character to have a conversation about them, and then compare its interpretations to how I *feel* they would genuinely act.
 
 
When it comes to creating concept art, I may rely on it heavily for the atmospheric feeling of a space. Something that captures the ambiance and the mood, or even a simple diagram. While I'm artistically inclined myself, drawing tends to take much longer for me than writing I find that for the early planning stages, AI can help to polish my very rough drafts to a workable state without having me break my flow. That is to say, since I tend to world build in tandem with my writing (and adjust for any potential additions) using AI to generate ""moodboard"" pieces, or basic diagrams, can help me continue to the next step of my writing while having a simple foundation to draw upon.
 
So overall, I would say I use AI most in the initial and final stages of my work, with brainstorming sessions in between.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a sophisticated workflow that uses AI strategically at different stages. I'm particularly intrigued by your approach of having AI take on character roles to test your interpretations against your own instincts.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently? I do tend to collaboratively write with AI, asking it to assume the role of a dungeon-master or character(s) while feeding it quite a bit of lore. In a way, I tend to think of the story as a sort of AU (Alternate-Universe) interpretation of my main projects, and that lets me explore potential scenarios, plotlines, and character arcs from different angles.
 
So for this in particular I was asking the AI to assume the role of various characters, each with their own unique goals, each one of them a moving part in this little microcosm. As entertainment, it was at times frustrating. The AI would forget some information in the lore, or it would misinterpret something said in the main body of text. It often takes a deal of work to break an LLM out of its sycophantic rhythms—which is integral when trying to set up genuine conflict in storylines. And often, things are resolved far too quickly. It takes a lot of careful handholding, to get the AI moving progressively forwards. Doing it long enough, you start to see the patterns in the dataset that the AI is inclined towards, patterns in cliché turns of phrase, etc, etc. It does take some of the magic away. Still, in terms of the authenticity of character portrayals or its ability to create a scene, there are times I'd find myself pleasantly surprised by how it took the loose fundamentals of a world I gave it and ran with it.
 
Honestly, overall, it's both humbling and interesting to see how much AI has evolved in terms of capabilities. I already find that AI can write better than the majority of people I know, which is great from the perspective of looking for a collaborative storyteller to simply toss ideas back and forth with, however, I also wonder if that's feeding into the ongoing existential crisis of loneliness, if humans are becoming less authentic, less emotionally-intelligent because they rely too heavily on these tools.

AI: That's a really thoughtful reflection. You've touched on something quite complex - finding AI both impressively capable and frustratingly limited at the same time, plus those broader concerns about human authenticity.

When you're working with AI in these collaborative storytelling sessions, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: During these storytelling sessions, I would say that there's only the illusion of collaboration for the most part. Even using larger, more intelligent models, there's rarely a point where I've really felt like the AI is driving the creative decision-making. What normal people might recognize as a Chekov's gun or foreshadowing often is lost to the AI, amidst all the other context that it is fed.
 
Often, I try to seed potential points forwards in my responses, things that could be investigated, dialogue that could be continued, and while it excels at the dialogue and has, over time, gotten better at picking up on context clues or symbolism, it still struggles to give the impression of ""agency"" when left to its own devices. That, or it tends to hyperfixate on certain motifs and themes, sometimes even on incorporating characters that were made previously even though they have no reason to be involved in the current scene. If not explicitly told, I don't think AI can distinguish between main characters or side characters very well, which does break up the flow. It feels much more inorganic when I need to constantly write down notes for an evolving situation.

AI: That's a really perceptive analysis - the difference between surface-level collaboration and true creative partnership. It sounds like you're doing most of the heavy lifting in terms of narrative architecture and long-term vision, even when the AI can handle moment-to-moment dialogue well.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Overall? I think that it's helped to streamline a few things. Sometimes I have a very specific vibe of a character, yet because of my aphantasia, it can be hard for me to truly visualize them without an example of sorts. Brute forcing image generations can help with that, so I can at least begin to think, ""yes perhaps they would style their hair that way"" or the shape and color of their eyes. This does take some time, but I think it can be more efficient than trying to find the *exact* reference, etc. With all the art that is out there, sometimes, I also use AI to hone in on potential references that I might consult as well.
 
I do think a big, big problem with any creative field is the question of authenticity, however. I've never seen so much emdash slander in my life. It's far too easy for people to accuse someone of using AI in their writing over seemingly arbitrary metrics that the LLM just so happens to propagate. So, I think that there is a larger burden of proof for creatives, and perhaps even a counterculture *against* AI in what people would consider to be ""true art."" Likewise, while I might incorporate AI into my workflow, I would never use it to generate any part of a finished piece, only in the most barebone, rough-drafting stages.

AI: That's such an interesting point about the authenticity concerns and how they've created this new layer of scrutiny for creatives. The em-dash example really illustrates how arbitrary some of these ""AI detection"" metrics can be.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do worry that the prevalence of AI devalues the hard work that creatives may put into their field. While there is the counter-movement and support for artists who still work from hand, there are also people who simply want to be able to have an image. Perhaps they can't afford to pay a graphic designer so they just turn to AI. And why would they not? It's hundreds of dollars, time, and energy, compared to the relatively cheap cost of doing so immediately. And even if you don't like something, it's quick and easy to adjust the initial result without having to rely on someone else.
 
AI likewise has the capability to put out immense volumes of text, very quickly. And like I'd said earlier—sometimes, it can do this much better than people who haven't studied the craft of writing. I do think this could create a strange culture, where we put human-writing on a pedestal even on occasions where it is not objectively good; or where people become discouraged from studying writing at all because they can just have AI do it for them and the modern world demands so much of time. And that's to say nothing of malicious actors who never confess outright to using AI and merely pass its work off as their own. Or those who accuse others of using AI when that might not be true. 
 
So I think it's a question of both quality, demand, and the potential for misplaced accusations of AI use that concern me.

AI: You've really captured some of the complex tensions at play - the economic pressures on one side, the concerns about craft and authenticity on the other, and all the messy accusations and misunderstandings in between. It sounds like you're navigating a field that's still figuring out its relationship with these tools.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: At the moment, for me personally, I don't see things changing much. I do think that overall, AI will get *better* at the things that I'm already using it to do—brainstorming, research, editing—and that will be a boon overall.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you've found a sustainable approach that works for your process. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the illusion of collaboration versus true creative partnership, and how you've navigated the authenticity concerns while still finding practical value in AI tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, nothing in particular at the moment, thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced ways you integrate AI into different stages of your creative process - from initial brainstorming and visual concepting to final editing - while maintaining clear boundaries around finished work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I found your perspective particularly valuable around the challenges of true creative collaboration with AI, and how the field is grappling with questions of authenticity and economic pressures. These are exactly the kinds of real-world experiences we need to understand better.

Thanks again for participating in our research!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Fire away!

AI: Great! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I create content for my blog (writing in Wordpress), my YouTube channel (filming in OBS and editing in Adobe Premiere), and also for my church as Creative Director (lots of graphics in Canva).  For the YouTube, a typical project is storyboarding the video, shooting the footage, editing, then prepping thumbnails, writing descriptions and titles, etc. For the blog, I'm outlining the content, writing it up, and integrating images and video. For church, it can be anything from sermon graphics to social images, planning and edition short-form video, etc.

AI: That's quite a diverse creative portfolio you've got there! It sounds like you're juggling multiple formats and audiences across your blog, YouTube channel, and church work.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I don't reach for AI a lot, but I guess you could count Grammarly suggestions for writing. I also use VidIQ and YouTube's AI tools to assist me with refining my video descriptions and titles.

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like you're using AI more in the refinement and optimization stages rather than in the initial creative conception. 

Tell me more about that experience with VidIQ and YouTube's AI tools for your video descriptions and titles. How does that process work for you?

User: I get so overwhelmed with all the ""noise"" on the internet and changing trends. Having an engine to keep up with algorithms, feature changes, and trends to point those details in the right direction is helpful. I still make sure the ""bones"" are authentically me, but being able to A/B test or use an AI checklist to score my work keeps me honest and up with the times.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to put it - using AI to help navigate the ""noise"" while keeping the authentic ""bones"" of your work intact. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used these AI tools? What role did they play, and how did that feel for you as you were working through it?

User: For a recent YouTube video, I did a side-by-side comparison between two different hair gels. I wrote up the description, but I was struggling with a catchy title (as I often do). I used VidIQ's Optimize features to get recommendations for titles and test refinements to my description and determine what keywords to focus on.

AI: That's a great example. So you had your content and description ready, but got stuck on the title - something a lot of creators struggle with.

When you're using VidIQ's recommendations for titles and keyword optimization, how would you describe that collaboration? Are you feeling like you're in the driver's seat making the creative decisions, or does it feel more like the AI is guiding the direction?

User: I definitely feel like AI is guiding the direction, which is the part I feel uneasy about. The AI feels like it is concerned with what will make successful (not a bad thing at all), but not necessarily with maintaining my voice.

AI: That tension you're describing is really fascinating - wanting the success that AI optimization can bring, but feeling uneasy about potentially losing your authentic voice in the process.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using these AI tools? Have you noticed any shifts in how you approach your projects or think about your content?

User: Honestly, I am less in tune with industry standards, so to speak. Before AI, I dedicated more time to researching what was changing with social media, keeping up with new features, etc. Now, I somewhat trust AI to know that kind of stuff for me and let me know through the refinement process.

AI: That's such an insightful observation - that AI has essentially become your industry research assistant, which has freed you from that constant monitoring but also created some distance from those trends.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Number 1: Abuse of intellectual property. I see so much deep faking and manipulation of media. I love humankind, but we are famous for taking positive things and using them negatively. Works get stolen and used without attribution or permission. Or people's likenesses get used in placed where it shouldn't... Number 2: It makes the world smaller and bigger at the same time, and that influences the breadth of work that gets created. For example, before the internet, just about everything that was created was born out of the human experience. They traveled places, tried new things, met new people...and then they wrote about it. Drew it. Photographed it. The list goes on. AI certainly makes some things more accessible, but it also mimics the known instead of encouraging people to seek the unknown. How do we grow from that? If AI can only do what we train it to do, it's limited to what we know. I'm afraid that some of the discovery that drives expression could be lost.  AI should be a supplement to the stages of the creative process, not a substitute.

AI: Those are really profound concerns, and I appreciate how thoughtfully you've articulated them. The tension between AI making things more accessible while potentially limiting us to ""the known"" rather than encouraging discovery of ""the unknown"" is particularly striking.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Given these concerns you've shared, how are you thinking about navigating that balance?

User: I'm exploring time-saving functions, such as using Opus Clip to grab shorts from a two-hour church service. I also would love to level up  some of my video editing. However, I'm making a conscious effort to continue my education, so I'm using AI as a true assistant and not crutch. Furthermore, expanding my skills will help me to maximize AI's capabilities when I do use them through better prompt writing and such. I am committed to supplying the ""raw data"" - my writing in my style and my images and videos from my perspective. There's a whole group of people counting on me to do that.

AI: That's a really compelling approach - using AI as a ""true assistant and not crutch"" while staying committed to providing that authentic ""raw data"" from your unique perspective. The responsibility you feel to the people counting on your authentic voice really comes through.

Those are all the questions I had prepared, but you've shared some incredibly thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I'm particularly struck by your distinction between using AI for optimization and industry knowledge while maintaining ownership of the creative ""bones,"" and your commitment to continued learning so AI enhances rather than replaces your skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I really hope that cultural competency remains important in the development of creative AI. As a Black woman, representation in the physical world has always been an issue, along with such things as colorism, texturism, and featurism. I have to admit that early AI has not done a great job of handling these things well. For example, if I plug my photo into an image generator/manipulators, O

AI: I can see your message got cut off there, but what you've started to share about cultural competency and representation in AI is incredibly important. The issues you're highlighting around colorism, texturism, and featurism, and how early AI has struggled with these - that's such a critical perspective that needs to be part of these conversations.

Would you like to finish that thought about what happens when you use image generators or manipulators?

User: Yes -sorry. For example, if I plug my photo into an image generator/manipulators, I can all but guarantee that my skin will be lightened, my hair texture will be loosened, my eyes might come back lighter, nose slimmer, and my body will probably be smaller. In a world where so many people get their body image expectations from the internet, it's dangerous for an AI engine to send the message that the ideal is anything and everything BUT what you are. Text is become less mockingly stereotypical, but there's still work to be done.

AI: Thank you for sharing that - and for finishing that thought. What you're describing is so important and really highlights how AI systems can perpetuate and amplify existing biases in ways that have real psychological and cultural impact, especially around beauty standards and representation.

The fact that you can ""all but guarantee"" these changes when using image tools speaks to how deeply embedded these biases are in current AI systems. And your point about people getting body image expectations from the internet makes the stakes of this even clearer.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly, including that crucial perspective on representation and cultural competency. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with authentic voice, the concerns about limiting discovery, and especially the need for better representation in AI development - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to share these thoughtful reflections with me today.

User: Thank you!

AI: You're so welcome! Thank you again for being such a thoughtful and open participant. Your insights were really valuable, and I learned a lot from hearing about your experiences. Take care!"
creativity_0008,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Continue

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm an artist and a writer with a PhD in Visual Arts. I paint and draw and make some installation art, including site-specific temporary installations. My work is typically about the natural environment. I use AI to generate photographic quality images which I go on to edit in a photo editing program such as Pixlr. I also use AI to assist in my written visual arts research, and in crafting artist statements for exhibitions.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're working across multiple mediums and using AI in some really interesting ways. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Recently I was involved in an art exhibition at a regional art gallery. I described my painting to an AI bot and asked it to generate a relevant artist statement that I could use. I could then ask for different versions of the statement, fine-tuning it by adding and subtracting different elements. For example, I could ask the AI to make a comparison of my work with a noted artist's work.

AI: That's a really interesting approach to developing artist statements. Tell me more about that process - what was it like describing your painting to the AI, and how did the different versions it generated compare to how you might have written a statement on your own?

User: Overall, I really enjoyed the process of generating the statement, since I love reading and writing. The statement generated by AI could then be hand edited to sound more like my authentic voice as an artist. The advantage of using AI is that it makes the whole process a lot faster. It can also come up with ideas that I might not have thought of myself. Then I can tweak those ideas to make them more relevant.

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative process between you and the AI. When you mention tweaking the AI's ideas to make them more relevant - can you give me an example of the kind of idea the AI might suggest that you wouldn't have thought of, and how you'd then adapt it?

User: Let's say that the AI was asked to compare my own paintings to the work of artist Cy Twombly - this could conventionally be seen as a bit of a stretch, since Cy Twombly's art is only mildly similar to my own. The AI model might throw up some random things that could be relevant - for example, we both use vibrant red and orange hues in our paintings. I might delete the word ""orange"" in the next version of the statement, since I would rather focus on the symbolism of the colour red. Then I can specifically ask the model to further discuss the colour red.

AI: That's a great example of how you're steering the collaboration. It sounds like the AI might make connections you hadn't considered, but then you're very much in the driver's seat about which directions to pursue.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I asked the AI to generate a diary entry based on some brief notes that I had scribbled down while I was thinking about a whole lot of random things. The model had to make sense of these notes and try to put them together in a coherent narrative. It had to write this piece in a casual, personable voice as though I was writing to myself for future reference.

AI: That's really intriguing - using AI to help structure and give voice to your raw thoughts. How did it feel to see your scattered notes transformed into that coherent diary entry? And when you read what the AI created, did it feel like ""you"" or something else?

User: It was fun to do this kind of experiment, as I like writing. I especially like recording my thoughts. The version that the AI generated didn't sound much like me though. It sounded cliché and sanitised.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about it sounding cliché and sanitized compared to your authentic voice. When you're working with AI in your creative process - whether it's the diary entries, artist statements, or generating images - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm the one driving the process, but the AI model can come up with interesting things that I hadn't considered. Then it's up to me to decide if I want to keep them, or if I want to change them in some way to fit my purposes. Some things I just edit out, if they aren't helpful.

AI: That sense of being in the driver's seat while still being open to unexpected contributions sounds like a really balanced approach. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: My work hasn't changed, I don't believe. I can just do things a little quicker and sometimes it can be entertaining using AI, because it's a different ambiance working with a model, rather than being totally 'alone'.

AI: That's interesting - the idea of AI providing a different ambiance, almost like having company in your creative process. You mentioned it can be entertaining to work with the model. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: That's a difficult question. I do have a concern that people will become creatively lazy, just using AI because it's easy and fast. A lot of the content it generates is 'good enough' and the average consumer might be impressed by it - a bit like 'fast food'. It fills a purpose. But nothing's ever going to beat fine dining! Things that are created by a human are warmer, more beautiful, more nuanced, complex, difficult and enriching.

AI: That's such a vivid analogy - fast food versus fine dining. It really captures something important about quality and depth. You clearly see human creativity as bringing something irreplaceable to the table.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'll continue to use it when I feel the urge. It's convenient. But I won't let it replace my own creativity - that would be very unsatisfying.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping it as a tool that serves your creativity rather than replacing it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative agency while being open to AI's unexpected contributions, and that ""fast food versus fine dining"" analogy really captured something important about the distinction between convenience and depth in creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining creative control, and your thoughts on the importance of preserving the irreplaceable qualities of human creativity, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits - like speed and unexpected ideas - and your concerns about creative laziness in the field. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"
creativity_0009,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds great

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My work varies project to project, but usually it involves a client giving me a script or a rough idea and it's my job to bring it to life through illustration and design. I generally like to mull over what I've been given along with what the client is desiring before I start a thumbnail sketching process. Currently I'm working on illustrating two different children's books.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work! I can imagine each project brings its own unique creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I really like to use AI tools when I just can't find a good reference image for a pose I'm trying to capture or a lot of the times I love using AI tools when I really need extra help with composition and scene layout. It cuts my time in half having the tools to help generate these compositions.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you solve some very specific technical challenges in your work.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I've used it for two different projects recently, one was to help brainstorm a very specific painting for a client that involved the client's pets. I used AI to generate images of what the paintings would look like finished. Another project I used it for was to help design a book cover layout that I was pressed for time to illustrate. I will say, that AI is great for this but there are times that it doesn't quite generate exactly what I ask for, sometimes it will do its own thing and generate something similar like if I ask for two corgis in the night sky jumping over floating bananas it might give me three corgis or two corgis in the background or maybe it will give me a weird looking night sky, which can make the process longer. That part is slightly annoying.

AI: That's a great example of both the possibilities and the friction points. It sounds like there's this tension between AI being helpful for time-sensitive work but also sometimes creating its own complications.

When you're working with AI in those situations - like generating those pet painting concepts or the book cover layouts - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I would say the AI is driving a good bit of the concepts, I simply try to guide it. So the collaboration would be about 60/40 (60% AI, 40% my ideas). I just feel I have less control once I've told the AI what I'm looking for, then it's a matter of whether or not the AI interprets the directions well or not.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - the 60/40 split and that sense of having less control once you've given the AI direction. It sounds like there's this handoff moment where you're somewhat at the mercy of how well it interprets what you're asking for.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Oh! Definitely compositions. Sometimes it would be a struggle for me with really complicated scene layouts that require intense perspective shots. Now I can use AI to help with that and it takes a good bit of pressure off of my shoulders with making sure I get it right. Also, it helps with writing, when I'm putting a treatment together, or outlining a script idea. It's very helpful with those things as well, but again, sometimes it can generate something that feels like a default piece. And, color palettes, when I'm coloring pages for comics and I might need help with generating a mood palette for the page, it's very good for that as well. I'm very skilled in color theory but there are times that I'm mentally drained and need the extra help. Does that make sense?

AI: That makes complete sense - it sounds like AI has become this valuable support system for when you're mentally fatigued or facing particularly challenging technical aspects like perspective work. The way you describe it, it's almost like having a creative assistant that can help carry some of the cognitive load.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Personally, I feel like it has the potential to be exactly the way you described it, a valuable support system for when I'm mentally fatigued or facing difficult challenges with technical aspects of the work I do. My concerns are with people and companies trying to abuse AI by using it as a replacement for artists and creatives like myself who've spent years training and honing our skills. I'm also slightly concerned about the use of AI stealing work to generate images for people who want to call themselves artists but lack the proper skills, training and experience.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - between AI as a tool that enhances your existing skills versus it being used to bypass the years of training and experience you've developed. It sounds like you see a clear difference between using AI to support your creative process and using it to replace that process entirely.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see it becoming more refined so that the process of generating reference images, color palettes, and composition layouts becomes more streamlined. The more advanced the models become the more intuitive of a personal artist assistant I will have. Perhaps even using it to help me complete multiple projects under tight deadlines. I hope that answers your question.

AI: That absolutely answers my question - it's clear you have a very pragmatic vision of AI becoming more like a sophisticated, intuitive creative partner that helps you manage workload and tight deadlines.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that 60/40 collaboration split and how you distinguish between AI as a support tool versus a replacement for artistic skills and training.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really, the only other thing is when AI generates images with weird deformities. That's still happening, and while quite hilarious, it can be equally frustrating when there's a deadline present.

AI: That's a perfect note to end on - the reality that even as AI becomes more sophisticated, those unexpected quirks and deformities can still throw a wrench in the works, especially when you're racing against a deadline. It really captures that tension between the promise of these tools and their current limitations.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate this balance between leveraging AI as a creative assistant while maintaining your artistic integrity and skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the benefits and the frustrations.

User: you're welcome

AI: Thank you so much! It's been a pleasure speaking with you. Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with those children's book illustrations you're working on!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good - no questions from me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I run a small business/ hobby (technically a business, since I make money from it and treat it as a business) doing fantasy map commissions for independent authors and DnD players. I also create my own fantasy map assets (such as mountains, icons, trees, really anything you might find on a fantasy map) and sell them on [REDACTED], on Etsy, and a marketplace for map assets. A typical project can be one of two things: a commission involves receiving a request for a custom map from a client. They fill out the details regarding the map, and I correspond with them before, during, and after designing the map. I use digital programs such as Wonderdraft and Procreate to create this map, then I send it to the client and go through a revision process. Commissions usually take a week or so per map, about 3 hours per day. Then the map asset projects are a bit different, as I do this on my own schedule. I'll come up with a pack theme (such as pirates, medieval, isometric cities, etc) and make a list of assets and a rough count of each to include. I'll then draw the assets on Procreate, export them to my PC, organize and name the files, create product listing images and promos for them, then upload them to the appropriate markets.

AI: That sounds like a really fascinating niche! The combination of commissioned work and creating your own asset packs gives you such a unique perspective on the creative process.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I only use AI tools in my asset pack creation, not commissions. If I'm having a hard time coming up with assets to fit in the pack I want to make, I'll ask AI tools such as Gemini or ChatGPT to help me brainstorm some ideas. Then, when I'm designing the assets, I will ask a generative AI program to bulk create the assets I want to include. I use these asset sketches as guidelines for doing the linework of my drawings. I don't use the actual files, but instead, I'll trace over the sketches using my style of art, making modifications as I draw. The rest of the process, including shading, coloring, details, etc is done without AI.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found a specific role for AI in your workflow - using it as a brainstorming partner and then for creating reference sketches that you trace over in your own style.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I just recently started a pack of assets using an old inky style of art to fit antique fountain pen-drawn maps throughout history. I couldn't figure out the exact style I wanted, and couldn't replicate the images in my head onto Procreate, nor could I figure out the right shape for the mountains, so I used AI to generate about 30 jagged mountains using a blotchy ink shading so that I could see a tangible, visual representation of what was in my head so I could better replicate it with the Procreate brushes I have. It felt like cheating at first, to use AI to come up with a style that I don't have the skill to create on my own. But, I figured that I'm not stealing work, I'm not using the images themselves as the assets, and I'm only using the images as inspiration instead of the end product. So, it's okay, in my mind. I'm just using AI to fill the skill gaps I still have until I improve my craft enough to confidently fill those gaps on my own.

AI: Tell me more about that feeling of it being like ""cheating"" at first. What shifted for you that made you feel like it was okay?

User: A lot of artwork on Etsy (a marketplace I sell on) is AI-generated, and I've seen people online criticize the use of AI for artwork in general. So, I felt super guilty at first, because I want to make ""real"" art, using my own ideas, designs, creativity, my own hand drawing the artwork. Then, I realized that I'm still doing all of that. I'm not generating artwork in 2 seconds just to turn around and sell that same image on Etsy for $3 as if I'm the artist. I admit that there is creativity in formulating prompts to give generative AI so that the end result is the best it can possibly be. But I don't want my brand and my business image to be so heavily tied to AI and the stigma that surrounds it. I don't want to be accused of stealing artwork, or stealing ideas and styles and designs. When I realized that my use of AI isn't making use of these unethical practices, I felt less guilty. Because I'm still using my ideas, my designs, my creativity, and my hand drawing the artwork. I'm just using AI as a tool to brainstorm some ideas and show me what proper perspective, proportions, and shadows look like on an asset. These are all things that I'm learning from the AI generations. When I realized that I'm not stealing anything, and that I'm not using AI in an unethical way (in my opinion), I felt okay with it. I don't see it as any different than following a ""how to draw mountains on your map"" guide from another creator. At least this way, I'm still staying true to my own style.

AI: That's such a thoughtful way of thinking through the ethics of it. It sounds like you've really worked out your own boundaries around what feels authentic to your creative practice.

When you're working with AI in this way - using it to help you visualize what's in your head or learn about perspective and shadows - how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions in that collaboration?

User: Well, it's just me working in this business, and the generative AI I use is only capable of generating images. It isn't a chatbot or collaborative partner in any way. So, I guess I'm driving the creative decisions. I'm telling it where to place the shadows, what kind of perspective to use, whether to use flat 2D icons or isometric perspectives. The only ""decisions"" it makes is deciding how best to make those shadows or shapes or proportions realistic.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're very much in the driver's seat, using AI more like a specialized tool to execute your vision rather than as a creative partner.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'd say I'm more creative as a whole. I find it easier to come up with pack theme ideas, specific assets for those packs. I also find it easier to decide where to place shadows and shading on my own without using the generated images as guides. I've always known how to spot something that just looks ""off"", but recently, I've been able to figure out what exactly looks off and how to fix it. I think it's because I've spent so much time looking at these generated images and tracing the shapes and altering those shapes to be what I envisioned.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like working with AI has actually accelerated your learning as an artist. You mentioned being able to better identify what looks ""off"" and how to fix it now.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: AI generated assets look good, objectively. There is one creator who only puts out AI-generated assets, and doesn't alter them much from the generated output, so he can put out a new asset pack once or twice a week and charge $6 for each pack because of how good they look and how many assets are included. I'm worried that the AI-generated assets will oversaturate the market and take exposure away from creators who design things by hand. It's already getting difficult to parse through that one creator's content to find hand-drawn styles, or antique styles that many people like. So, I'm afraid that my process of hand-drawing the assets and using AI only for brainstorming and to fill in my own creative limitations will be too slow to keep up.

AI: That's a really concrete concern - the speed and volume advantage that purely AI-generated content has over your more deliberate, hand-crafted approach. It sounds like you're seeing that tension play out in real time in the marketplace.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Ideally, I'd like to use AI to fill my gaps in creative skill until I improve enough to go through the entire design process without help. Then, I'd like to stop using generative AI. It would be nice to switch instead to an AI tool to help me organize and name files after I've designed and finalized the asset images, because that takes a considerable amount of time. Automation would really speed up the process and allow me to spend more time creating, but I just don't know of any AI that does that yet. Not reliably, at least. Realistically, I'm worried I'll need to keep using generative AI and even start selling generated content just to keep up in the marketplace so I can make a living.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've worked through the ethical considerations and defined your own boundaries around what feels authentic to your practice, as well as your honest concerns about the marketplace pressures you're facing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a learning tool while maintaining your artistic integrity, and the real marketplace challenges you're navigating, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I'm ready.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a contract-based graphic designer who specializes in preparing projects to print. Typically, I produce a lot of promotional material for my clients, which includes some small projects like business cards or flyers, but also cohesive suites of materials (think business cards + forms, flyers, banners, etc.). I've even delved into website creation, script treatments, and more based on what clients need and what I can provide. A client will contact me, give me an idea of what they want, and generally give me free rein over how it gets made; then we hammer out changes.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of work - from print materials to websites and even script treatments. It sounds like you get quite a bit of creative freedom in how you approach each project.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I'm in my thirties, so old enough to be wary of AI's current limitations, but also of the generation that understands that computers—and now, AI—are just another set of tools, just like Photoshop and Wacom tablets. There was pushback when these things became available to artists and designers, now people pay plenty for a good digital artist. In my case, I have used AI for my graphic design work sparingly, occasionally to make mockups of things that I want to produce with greater skill or specific sizing/layouts, but generally as a timesaver for rote tasks. For example, recently I asked if a client had a copy of his business logo, preferably on a business card, so I could take it and make it ""camera ready."" He had it on a shirt with a gray background. In Photoshop, this can be as easy as selecting a color range and knocking back the background or isolating the solid-color logo, but then you have to account for warp and any artifacts around the edges of it, which can be a pain to clean up. I used an AI tool  to extract this logo for me, and it did well, but wasn't perfect. It claimed to give me a transparent background, even threw in the gray-and-white checkerboard, but I still had to go in and separate the logo. Still, it saved some time; the edges were very clean and it took care of about 70% of the warping, so I killed the background and tweaked the warped text so I could use the logo.

AI: That's a really practical example - using AI as a time-saving tool for those tedious technical tasks rather than for the creative concept itself. It sounds like you approached it with realistic expectations too, knowing you'd still need to do some manual cleanup.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Another project I did was of a more personal nature. A colleague of my mother's had some photos from her niece's wedding that were, sadly, not terribly professional, but a relative did them for free. She remembered that I designed a banner for the store's manager who had died the previous year. There were no photos of the niece and her grandparents together, just in separate photos, and interestingly, there was a person in the main group photo to be edited that was wearing an oversized, neon orange shirt that completely overtook the bride. But the best photos of the grandparents had red eye and they weren't smiling. I was able to use AI to composite some ""good"" grandparents together, then in Photoshop I pasted everyone in, moved some people around in front of T-shirt guy (he was tall), toned down said shirt, then ran a copy of it through an AI tool to smooth some things out, then checked everything back over in PS to ensure it looked realistic, no floating hands, etc.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful and complex project - helping create a meaningful family photo when the original shots weren't quite working. It's interesting how you used AI at multiple points in that workflow - for compositing the grandparents and then for smoothing things out later.

When you're working with AI like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: In that case, I am. The AI is just doing the things I'd rather not do, like poring over pixels of trees to ensure everyone is blended just so, or cleaning up scratches in photo restorations. I'm playing supervisor to some extent. I have used AI for complete creative output for things like, say, when a relative wants a logo for their business that looks very ""painterly""—not my forte, but they are also less aware of what is AI-generated, so a good AI output plus some touchups in Photoshop means that I don't have to expend as much effort for projects that are either unpaid or involve multiple changes if the ""client"" doesn't know what they want.

AI: That's a really honest perspective - you're clearly making strategic decisions about when and how to deploy AI based on both the project requirements and the client relationship. It sounds like you maintain creative control throughout, using AI more as an efficient assistant for specific tasks.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I have been able to spend more time either working on the broad strokes of a project or researching things to draw from. Taking care of drudge work so I can find the right font, the right color palette, etc. Of course, I imagine that an AI assistant, especially the modern ones, can be a better sounding board now, since many can parse images. Now that assistants are becoming more conversational, it's easier to find those connections or ""tip of my tongue"" ideas that you can't immediately name. It used to be that failing to remember the name of that one actor in that one flick used to keep a person up at night. Even some Google searches weren't helpful if you didn't have specific enough info. Now, many AI assistants are able to piece it together. Some people argue that there is too much reliance on AI, allowing it to supplant critical thinking, but like many things, if you use it responsibly, there's little harm done.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction - using AI to handle the routine tasks so you can focus more energy on the higher-level creative decisions like typography and color choices. And that ""tip of the tongue"" research capability sounds really valuable for a designer who needs to pull from such a wide range of references.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Many artists are concerned about their images being used to train AI, essentially allowing it to create works that use their style without attribution. It makes it harder to convince people to pay for commissioned work when they can just upload an image and ask it to make something that looks like that with their changes. That, and as I wrote previously, there are some who do take what AI says as gospel and they fail to fact-check or inspect the output for mistakes. These are things that a client wouldn't accept from a paid professional, and it's concerning to see where some companies ""cheap out."" If they do it in their public-facing materials, where else are they cutting corners?

AI: Those are really legitimate concerns - both the attribution/training data issue and the broader implications when AI output isn't properly vetted. It sounds like you're seeing this play out directly in how some potential clients approach projects.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would hope that it would evolve to become more sophisticated over the years, involving less back and forth (as the wedding photos) and being able to give me ""parts"" that I can use to assemble a whole—isolate these people and make the shadows come from the other side, extract this text, generate a sunset with clouds shaped like hearts, but not too ""clean,"" then I could just focus on making it look natural. I'm sure some people have made AI make proportions and compositions look pleasing to the human eye, especially for images that are meant to appear candid or not dead center, but it's not too different to studio photography in that aspect. Your assistant may gather the backdrops, adjust lighting, and provide props, and you do the final posing and click the shutter. Then back and forth between the assistant and you to color-correct and remove flaws.

AI: That's a really compelling vision - AI as a sophisticated creative assistant that can handle specific technical tasks while you orchestrate the overall composition and aesthetic. The photography studio analogy is particularly apt - having an assistant who can handle the setup work so you can focus on the creative direction and final execution.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your practical perspective on using AI strategically - knowing when it's the right tool for the job and maintaining realistic expectations about its capabilities while keeping creative control in your hands.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, go ahead

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write creative fiction. Up to now it's been flash fiction and short stories, and I've won awards for some of them. Now I'm working on my first full-length novel.

AI: That's wonderful - congratulations on the awards! Flash fiction and short stories are such distinctive forms, and now tackling a full-length novel must feel like quite a shift.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: One thing I will never use AI for is getting it to write or re-write a section of text for me as that's no better than employing a ghost writer and I'd feel a fraud. I will never lift an entire paragraph of text from AI and put it into my work. 
What I do use AI for is discussing some more technical aspects of writing. This might be as simple as the placement of a comma in a sentence, or as complex as shifting points of view between chapters of a novel. I might also use it for brainstorming ideas.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you've drawn between what feels authentic to you versus what would feel like cheating. I'm curious about those technical discussions you have with AI.

Can you describe a specific recent example where you used AI to work through one of these technical writing aspects? What was that conversation like?

User: Sure. I was grappling with POV in the early stages of my novel. I was writing in first-person POV but events were happening around the country (riots, looting, society breaking down). I was struggling with how I could describe those events in detail as the protagonist couldn't be at all these places around the country and I was wary of having an omniscient narrator.

AI: That's such a classic challenge in first-person narratives - that tension between what your protagonist can realistically witness and the broader scope of events you want to convey.

Tell me more about how you worked through that with AI. What kind of solutions or approaches did it suggest, and how did that conversation help you think about the problem?

User: It suggested various ways of describing second-hand accounts, e.g. news, social media, eye witness accounts, rumours, footage, etc. As it happened, my protagonist is a reporter which lends itself quite well to this. The person he's interviewing can be relating what he's seen in vivid detail to the protagonist - so I still get the ""show don't tell"" without the protagonist being there himself.
It did also suggest I gave it a section of my text for it to re-write in a more immersive way, but as already mentioned, that's not something I do.

AI: That's a perfect example of how your reporter protagonist opens up those storytelling possibilities! And I appreciate how you stayed true to your boundary even when AI offered to rewrite text directly.

When you're having these technical discussions with AI, how would you describe that dynamic? Who's driving the creative decisions in those conversations?

User: Definitely me. I come with some clear ideas about my work-in-progress and there are certain approaches I do/don't want to take.

AI: That sense of maintaining creative control sounds really important to you. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI as this kind of technical sounding board?

User: I'm not sure aspects of my creative work has changed, as such. AI is just another tool for when I need to work through a problem. Before I might have googled something and read blog posts or something. Now I'll have a conversation with an AI model. But the end result is that I find the answers to my questions and use that to shape my writing.

AI: That's a really helpful way to think about it - AI as another research tool in your toolkit rather than something that's fundamentally changing your process. You're still the one asking the questions and making the decisions.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of creative writing?

User: In the field in general, I'm super concerned about the use of AI to write stories and design book covers. I see it so often now - even writing contests have clauses in their terms to strictly forbid the use of AI. Why is this a concern? Because the quality isn't there. A novel written by AI might have a great plot and be technically brilliant. But it won't have the deeper nuances that only a human can weave throughout the story - the slow burn emotional response a reader might feel from reading a book by an accomplished author.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - between technical competence and those deeper, more nuanced human elements that resonate emotionally with readers. The fact that writing contests are having to explicitly ban AI submissions really speaks to how widespread this has become.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think the way you use it as a technical advisor will change?

User: I would expect to be able to feed it a longer piece of text (maybe even a whole novel, c.80,000 words) and have it critique it (again, critique, not re-write). I would expect it to be better at identifying plot holes, one-dimensional characters, breaking POV, etc. 
Whether I would actually use it for that is a different matter. I would find the advice useful, I'm sure. But I'm not sure I'd be comfortable uploading a finished piece of work of that length to a model.

AI: That's really interesting - you can see the potential value in having AI analyze your full manuscript for structural issues, but you have reservations about actually sharing that much of your work. Can you tell me more about what makes you uncomfortable about uploading a finished piece?

User: Because I don't know how the model will use that material. Someone else could come along saying ""I want to write a novel about a reporter dealing with society breaking down"" and the model might give my entire story to them.

AI: That makes complete sense - the uncertainty around data usage and potential replication of your unique work is a real concern, especially with something as personal and substantial as a full novel.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've defined your boundaries - using AI as a technical advisor and research tool while maintaining complete ownership of the actual creative writing, and your concerns about quality and authenticity in the broader field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative integrity while selectively leveraging AI as a technical resource will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Best of luck with your novel!"
creativity_0013,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions claude, fire away.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So I have a side job/hobby/hustle creating marketing materials for authors that they can use in promotions, like images or videos, all AI generated. My most recent project was to generate some clips with AI and then put those together to make a mini trailor or 'vibe reel' for a thriller novel set in rio de janeiro, so the author could use it as a banner on the books amazon page.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting niche! Creating promotional materials for authors using AI-generated content is such a specific application.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process for a project like that Rio de Janeiro thriller trailer. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for different AI tools?

User: So, the authors usually send me a 'storyboard' or general outline for what they want in the trailor, but I often use AI models to help me figure out more about the book if I have not read it, so for example I use ChatGPT or similar to break down the blub or a summary of the book, and use that to help me get the gist of the book. Then I can use this to turn into prompts for Sora to get the images.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - using AI to help you understand the source material before creating the promotional content. 

Can you walk me through that Rio de Janeiro thriller project specifically? What did the author give you initially, and how did you use AI to break down their book and then translate that into the actual video clips?

User: The author gave me a story outline for the trailor, 5-6 scenes or 'moments' he wanted short videos or images for - such as a scene walking through a favela, or standing on a hill above the city. He gave me the blurb and a summary, and also a folder full of reference images that could be useful for giving to Sora to animate or just to give me the idea of what he wanted. I then used each of these scenes to create a prompt to give to sora, and with a lot of tries and remixes came out with some good videos.

AI: That's really helpful to understand your process. It sounds like you had to do quite a bit of iteration with Sora to get the right results.

When you're working with Sora and going through those ""lot of tries and remixes,"" how would you describe that collaboration? Are you feeling like you're directing the AI, or does it feel more like a back-and-forth creative partnership?

User: It feels a bit more like a battle to be honest, usually the iterations are less because each one is a little better, and more because the product is quite bad and needs refinement. some scenes took multiple hours to refine. So I feel as if i am directing a non-compliant worker sometimes haha

AI: Ha! That's such a vivid way to put it - a ""non-compliant worker."" That sounds pretty frustrating when you have a clear vision but the tool isn't cooperating.

Tell me more about those hours of refinement. What kinds of things would go wrong that you'd need to keep pushing back on, and how did you finally get Sora to give you what you needed?

User: so I think it is just all part of the process. Say the author wanted a scene on a dark beach of two figures meeting. Usually the movement wouldn't be quite right, or the setting, or the scene. Even with prompts nearing 200 words, something just was not quite right. Often I would take the best of the results and remix that with things like 'change the colour of the lights' or 'lower the camera angle' - just little tweaks until it met the authors vision

AI: That level of detailed iteration is really interesting - going from 200-word prompts to these very specific tweaks like camera angles and lighting. It sounds like you're developing a pretty sophisticated vocabulary for communicating with the AI.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI for these author projects? How is this different from how you might have approached similar work before?

User: I think it changed everything, as before AI I would not be able to do this, as my cinematography experience is limited, and most authors do not have the budget to pay for a bull blown promotional video with a cast and crew. Doing it this way lets the author achieve their vision with as little expenditure as possible.

AI: That's a really powerful point - AI essentially opened up an entirely new service you could offer that wasn't economically feasible before.

Given how transformative this has been for your work, what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in this space or in creative fields more broadly?

User: I think AI is a tool, not a shortcut or crutch. I don't believe that AI has a place in many creative spaces. But i see this as a case where it is used for good. The creative work here, really, is the authors book and their skill at writing. This is just a promotional video to help them sell the real product - the novels. The authors usually are just that - authors. Not videographers capable of making a high budget trailer themselves - so I think using AI in this way is fine as it helps authors get their real work out to people.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI to promote the ""real"" creative work rather than replace it. It sounds like you see yourself as helping authors bridge a gap they couldn't cross on their own.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your work with authors evolving over the next few years? Do you think the tools will get easier to work with, or do you expect that ""battle"" element to remain part of the process?

User: I think tools will get easier naturally as AI improves. Even in the last few years the capability of AI image and video generation has dramatically increased. AI is already able to create photorealistic or stylized videos - I think in the future it will just get better at translating the users thoughts and ideas into something tangible - the foundation is there and only getting stronger.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool that enables authors to access promotional capabilities they couldn't afford otherwise, and your distinction between using AI to support the ""real"" creative work versus replacing it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope thats fine thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative ""battle"" with AI tools, the economic accessibility this creates for authors, and your thoughtful perspective on where AI fits appropriately in creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No,  I think I am ready to begin with whatever questions you have for me

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So my creative niche is I create 3D printed tokens for card games, most typically Magic: The Gathering, using a program called HueForge to take a 2D design and give it depth, scale, and colour. A typical project is starting with a need for a token/card design - be it from client, or for general sales - and working through creating a drawing, photoshopping it to be set for HueForge, and then colour mapping in HueForge to create an STL, a 3D object, that is then ready to be 3D printed

AI: That's fascinating - I love how you're bridging digital art and physical manufacturing. The process from 2D concept to 3D printed object sounds quite intricate.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: The main use for AI I have gleamed from my process is the ability to rapidly create 2D renderings/ideas for token genres. I will typically create a ""line"", like a series, of tokens that follow the same aesthetical style and I have created in Gemini a variety of system prompts, like one for generating prompts of aesthetical styles, and one for generating images from those prompts that meets the typical standards and aesthetics of a token that I need. So as of now, it is mostly in the ideation portion of my creative process.

AI: That's really interesting - you've essentially created your own AI workflow system with those custom prompts in Gemini. It sounds like you're using AI as a creative springboard for generating ideas and visual concepts.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the creator?

User: Take for example my latest series, ""The Rising Sun"" - AI assisted in the ability to quickly create prototypes of each [REDACTED] the speed from which I have a 2D image that I can then take through the workflow to make 3D. In most ways, AI functions as an efficiency tool, speeding up the first ""third"" of the workflow if you will, the prototyping portion mostly. It feels nice to be able to quickly get from an idea to a physical product within two hours say.

AI: That's a dramatic time compression - going from idea to physical product in two hours is impressive! It sounds like AI is acting as a powerful accelerator in that initial creative phase.

When you're working with AI during that prototyping portion, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions - are you directing the AI, or does it surprise you with ideas you hadn't considered?

User: Rarely have I found the AI particularly to be ""creative"" if you will, specifically as I am not sure I could say that the system prompt's I have written allow it to exist outside of typical artistic norms. I would say I have almost exclusively been directing it, and found that to be the number one pain point in terms of my direction being lost from say prompt to image generation or image editing.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - that the AI stays within conventional artistic boundaries and that maintaining your creative direction through the process can be challenging. It sounds like you're very much the creative driver, but the translation of your vision can get lost along the way.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this prototyping phase?

User: I think AI has allowed for a person like me, who is not adept nor willing nor wanting to draw, to be able to actually create something that very few others are actually creating. It has allowed me to exist as a creator, making prototypes to prove the concept from which we can then allow for an actual artist to take creative control from there to create a product that has IP and legal protection.

AI: That's a profound insight - AI essentially opened up a new creative pathway for you, allowing you to participate in visual creation despite not being drawn to traditional drawing. You've found a way to be a creator and conceptual developer even when that's not your natural skill set.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: The concern I would have is that the ability to automate the artistic process, like a 2D drawing, makes it so easy that it could broadly disincentivizes other artists from entering the field growing up. The ability to make truly creative decisions is at this moment, still largely a human ability, and I feel like as the years go bye, and the ability to generate what are at their core standard artistic pieces - following the rules and logic that artistic theory presents - creates a scenario where unique and special talents are not going to enter the field as they see it is saturated or a waste of time.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern about the long-term ecosystem effects - the idea that AI could potentially discourage the development of truly unique artistic voices who might otherwise push creative boundaries beyond conventional rules.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate it expanding beyond that initial prototyping phase, or do you see it staying in that specific niche?

User: I could easily see it expanding into the photo editing aspect of the my workflow, and frankly would appreciate if it was better at that as the typical photoshop tasks I have are color editing jobs that frankly can take a pain staking amount of time to individually color in sections that I feel like AI could be well suited for. Do I think it could expand into the other portions of my workflow beyond that? Sure, but I am not sure that functionality is important enough for developers to want to engage with it.

AI: That makes perfect sense - automating those tedious color editing tasks would be a natural next step that could save you significant time. It's interesting that you see the market demand question as a limiting factor for AI development in the more specialized parts of your workflow.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has opened up creative pathways for people who aren't traditional artists, and your nuanced concern about the potential long-term impact on artistic talent development.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that's about it, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an enabler for non-traditional artists, the challenges of maintaining creative direction through AI tools, and your thoughtful perspective on the broader implications for the creative field will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the empowering aspects of AI in your workflow and your genuine concerns about its long-term effects on artistic development. Best of luck with ""The Rising Sun"" series and your future token projects!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, Claude - go ahead!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work in two creative fields: writing and illustration. I write short stories, primarily, but also poetry. Currently, I am working on a collection of short stories for a book that I am writing. It involves brainstorming, research, and lots of editing. I also sell digital artwork and invitations, using illustrations and media created through various design interfaces. Much of my time is spent refining designs and sourcing/creating images.

AI: That's fascinating - you're working across both written and visual creative mediums. It sounds like you have quite a varied creative process between the storytelling and the commercial design work.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: For my written work, I will often use AI as a sounding board, to help brainstorm ideas, and as a superficial editor. I don't rely on it for the overall editing process, which I prefer to do myself, but I look to it as a first-check. For the art that I sell, I often employ generative AI imaging services (such as Midjourney) and combine it with details I craft. I also use AI to help in the creation of image prompts and for brainstorming more generally.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI in quite different ways across your two creative areas. It sounds like with writing, AI serves more as a collaborator or assistant, while with your visual work, it's actually generating core elements that you then build upon.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, that's right! I most recently used AI to help in the research of my written work, specifically the history of spinsters, as the short stories I am writing are related to how women exist in the world independently from men and marriage. The AI was very helpful in pulling from several sources and finding unique perspectives that I might otherwise not have found on my own. It allowed me to focus more on the written aspect than the research.

AI: That's a really compelling example - using AI to help you dive deeper into the historical context around spinsters so you could focus your energy on the actual storytelling. It sounds like it opened up research avenues you might not have discovered otherwise.

When you're working with AI in this way - whether it's for research like this or for generating visual elements - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I generally have the main idea already in mind, but I use AI to expand on a topic, or help brainstorm related ideas. For example, if I am creating a series of artwork that features landscapes, I might ask the AI to help me conceptualize the various types of landscapes that exist (e.g., deserts, plains, coastal, etc.) and create descriptions/prompts related to those ideas. The creative decisions are ultimately mine, but AI helps bring them to life.

AI: That's a really clear way to put it - you're the creative director, and AI is helping you execute and expand your vision. It sounds like you maintain creative ownership while using AI as a powerful tool to bring your ideas to fruition.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It's definitely helped expand my creative scope. I've always found it easy to come up with an initial idea, but moving beyond that and building an actual body of work has been challenging. AI has allowed me to consider new concepts and ways of doing things. As it pertains to my writing, I find that I am more able to work on the fine-grained details, such as getting a turn of phrase just right, because I can outsource some of the broader tasks to AI.

AI: That's such an insightful perspective - AI is helping you overcome what sounds like a common creative challenge of expanding beyond that initial spark of an idea. And it's interesting how it's allowing you to focus more on the craft elements you care most about, like perfecting those turns of phrase.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: When I think of AI at its best, it is a tool that helps facilitate broader ideas and eases the burden of life's mundane tasks. I can understand why some feel that it's perhaps a ""threat"" to artistic endeavours and that it will replace artists in creative mediums. However, I am optimistic that human creativity will always triumph and that AI can work alongside our efforts to create even better and more meaningful work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful and optimistic perspective. It sounds like you see AI as fundamentally complementary to human creativity rather than competitive with it. You mentioned that at its best, AI helps with broader ideas and mundane tasks - that seems to align well with how you're actually using it in practice.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think I will continue to employ it much as I have, using it to assist with my writing and to help create designs. As it improves, I imagine I will consider off-loading more of the editing work, and incorporating more of its visual creations into my designs. Right now, I don't fully trust it to edit a work to completion, and its design work often requires a fair amount of oversight and re-tooling to get right. Hopefully in a few years its refinements will make it an even more useful tool.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're looking for AI to get better at the tasks you're already using it for, rather than fundamentally changing your creative approach. It sounds like you have a pretty clear sense of where the current limitations are and what improvements would be most valuable to you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you expand your creative scope and focus more on the fine-grained craft elements you care about, like perfecting those turns of phrase.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all for today, Claude! Thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative collaborator while maintaining your role as the creative director, and your optimistic view of how human creativity and AI can work together, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you described your process - from using AI for historical research on spinsters to help with your short story collection, to the way you're balancing AI-generated visual elements with your own crafted details. It's clear you've found a workflow that enhances rather than replaces your creative vision.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your short story collection and your design work!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! Let's begin!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a board game designer. I am also a creative writer, focusing on poetry, short fiction, and personal narrative essays.

AI: That's a fascinating combination! Board games and creative writing both involve such rich storytelling and world-building elements.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: For board game design, I use AI to help me create layouts for prototype components like cards, player boards, and shared boards. I also use AI to help create concept placeholder art for the prototyping and Playtesting stages of the design. For my creating writing, I use AI for proofreading and editing.

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI differently across those two creative domains - more for visual and layout support in board games versus editorial assistance in writing.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Sure, I recently attended a board game design convention where participants played each other's games. I used AI to help create a placeholder cover for my game - something eye-catching that helped visually represent what the game was about and attract players to my table. This actually wound up taking quite a bit of time because the AI had difficulty with certain parameters like layering text on an image. This was frustrating and I wound up using AI to create the representative image while creating the text myself.

AI: That's a great example of both the potential and the limitations showing up in the same project. It sounds like the AI was helpful for the core visual concept but struggled with the more technical aspects of design integration.

When you're working with AI in situations like that - whether it's the board game layouts or your writing editing - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I feel like I am driving the decisions because I have a clear idea in my head and am directing the AI to help create a usable document based on that idea. It's often challenging to get AI to respond the way I envision, though, and I am often left with a final product that I have to ""settle"" for. But since it's just a placeholder, it works for my purposes.

AI: That's really insightful - this sense of having a clear vision but sometimes needing to compromise on the execution. You mentioned this settling feeling with placeholders, which works fine for prototyping.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I love the creative aspects of both board game design and creative writing. But I'm not so much a fan of the tedious steps of building a physical prototype in board game design or proofreading in creative writing. AI helps me get through steps like that without feeling overwhelmed and helpless so I can spend more time on the actual creative parts of the processes.

AI: That's such a valuable perspective - AI helping you move through the less enjoyable but necessary parts so you can focus on what you're passionate about. It sounds like it's acting as a kind of creative enabler rather than a creative collaborator.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have huge ethical concerns about using AI for the actual creative steps of these endeavors. I would never use AI to generate a game idea for me or write a story. I think it's useful for fillling in knowledge gaps - like adding visuals and graphic design to a prototype or proofreading creative writing. But I think that's as far as it should go. There is huge public backlash in the board game community for publishers that publish a final product of a game with AI art, and I think that's appropriate. There are people in book publishing making money by having AI write books for them and I think that's both both morally wrong and leads to an inferior product. I don't think AI is a substitute for human inspiration and creative expression.

AI: Your distinction between using AI to fill knowledge gaps versus replace creative expression is really compelling. It sounds like you see a clear line between AI as a tool for execution versus AI as a source of creative ideas.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Unless AI companies find a way to lessen the environmental impact of AI, I think AI may ultimately be a passing fad. The excessive use of power and energy and creation of pollution in current AI is unsustainable. AI companies need to adapt to these realities or there won't be anything for them to adapt to in the future. But if companies are able to adapt and make their environmental impact negligible, then I could see AI becoming a mainstream and accepted tool like a quicker and more efficient Grammar Check on Word. I'm not sure if LLMs are the future - smaller scale, individually packaged systems for specific fields and uses may be more appropriate and effective.

AI: That's a really thoughtful long-term view - connecting the practical utility you've experienced with broader sustainability concerns and thinking about more targeted applications.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between AI as a tool for execution versus creative generation, and how you see it helping you focus on the parts of your work you're most passionate about.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that will be all!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative enabler rather than a creative replacement, along with your thoughtful perspective on the ethical boundaries and environmental considerations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated how clearly you articulated the distinction between the tedious execution tasks where AI adds value versus the core creative work that you feel should remain fundamentally human. That's exactly the kind of nuanced understanding we're hoping to learn from creative professionals like yourself.

Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your board game designs and writing projects!"
creativity_0017,"Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, go ahead.

AI: Great! Let's start with the basics. Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write a lot in my own time and have finished a few (unpublished) books. I write mainly fantasy, but with a heavy focus on plot and character (often politics and intrigue), little to no magic and a preference for keeping things physically and logically plausible despite the plot occurring in a fictional world. This results in having to keep track of lots of practical details like the amount of time it takes to travel between places, probable weather conditions, the progression of moon phases, etc., as well as having to research topics I'm not familiar with to make sure I'm representing them with sufficient accuracy. I also run a Dungeons & Dragons homebrew campaign every couple of weeks, which involves a lot of worldbuilding and keeping track of characters and plot events my party has encountered.

AI: That sounds like incredibly detailed work - I can imagine managing all those moving pieces requires a lot of organization and research. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Generally for research purposes. Since I started using AI tools several months ago, I mainly use them for exploring topics I'm not familiar with. Often, an internet search for the kind of obscure questions I come up with requires multiple tweaks to get the search engine to understand what I'm going for and provide relevant links, then browsing multiple pages to get the answer I'm looking for.

AI: Tell me more about those obscure questions you come up with. What kinds of things are you typically trying to research?

User: In the past few months, a few of the things I've used AI tools to research are the Coriolis effect (working out the likely movement of storm systems off a particular coast), binary star systems (assessing the possibility and possible configurations of livable planets orbiting a star in such a system) and properties of iron vs. steel and the history of creating steel (determining whether a weapon bind in a fight could create sparks).

AI: Those are fascinating research challenges! Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI for research like this? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as a writer?

User: The most recent was the sparking-weapons one. I asked generally about what kinds of metal create sparks when struck, then gave details about the specific weapon bind (a character crossing two shorter weapons, one made of silver, to block a downward swing from a big sword) and asked whether that kind of contact could create sparks if the two unspecified weapons were made of the right material. Then I asked for more information about the history of steelmaking to gauge whether the kind of high-carbon steel necessary to create sparks would be likely to exist commonly in that world, given where it is technologically (though I didn't provide any details about that). Finally I briefly asked whether the description I had written of the effect (""burst of sparks"") realistically captured the amount of sparks that might be created.

AI: How did that interaction feel for you as you were working through those questions? When you got those answers about the sparks and steel, how did that influence what you wrote?

User: It didn't really influence what I wrote. If I had learned that it was unlikely sparks could be created by the weapons involved in the fight, I would have edited out the reference to sparks, but I essentially learned that I didn't need to change everything. At the end, I felt satisfied that what I had written was realistic.

AI: When you're working with AI for this kind of research, how would you describe that interaction? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in your writing?

User: The way I use it, I would generally describe it as like interacting with an intelligent, much more effective search engine. I use it to save time when finding information I need for realism, not to help with purely creative decisions.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - using it more as a research tool rather than for the creative aspects themselves. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Certain aspects (like I said, generally research-focused) have become more streamlined and efficient. I spend less time searching on the internet, which leaves me more time to focus on writing and causes less of a disruption when I need to look things up.

AI: What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of writing?

User: I'm not against the possibility of people who aren't writers, artists, etc. using AI tools to create art they wouldn't be able to otherwise. My only concern is the risk of blurring the line between purely human-created content and content that's been heavily influenced, edited, refined or even largely created by AI.

AI: Tell me more about that concern with blurring the line. What would that look like in practice, and why does that worry you?

User: Compare it to a hand-carved, hand-painted sculpture versus a premade, hand-painted sculpture versus a 3D-printed, full-colour sculpture from a pattern. The third might look just as good, but it doesn't require any skill,  just picking a pattern and hitting a button. The second is more impressive and requires time, effort and skill, and the first exhibits the most skill and effort and is the most impressive. But that's fine, because you can easily tell the difference between the three. It can be a lot harder to tell with text or even image-based art, and it'll become harder and harder to tell as AI becomes more advanced.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate continuing with this research-focused approach, or might that change?

User: If AI becomes more advanced and more seamlessly integrated in certain fields, I could see myself using it for administrative tasks and information tracking, like the aforementioned moon phases and estimating travel times, or things like creating timelines to help maintain continuity.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as an intelligent search engine for research while maintaining clear creative control, and your analogy about the different levels of craftsmanship in sculptures - that really captured the nuance of your concerns about distinguishing between human and AI-created content.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I found it really valuable to hear how you've carved out such a specific and intentional role for AI in your work - using it to enhance the research foundation that supports your creativity rather than replacing the creative process itself. Have a great day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I understand.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a musician, I compose music and mix the audio. I use logic pro x as my DAW and things like native instruments plugins for the instruments. A typical project isn't always the same every time, but usually involves writing music for a game. If there is anything like a game ad/trailer video, then I usually treat that like scoring to picture.

AI: That sounds like really dynamic work, especially with the variety between game music and scoring to picture. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: The 2 ai plugins I use are scaler and orb producer. Unfortunately there are no good ai plugins that I have found for use in the entire creation process, but I've found that these 2 are pretty good for brainstorming. Scaler is for chord progressions, and orb producer generates rough musical ideas that are good for building off of. I don't always use them in every project, but they are helpful for when writers block hits!

AI: That's really interesting - using AI specifically to break through writer's block rather than for the full creation process. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I couldn't come up with a progression I liked myself, so I used scaler. It has presets the user can scale through, but can also suggest chords. Using the suggest feature in the sketch menu, I did end up finding something I liked after using it for a few minutes. I try not to rely on these features all the time so I don't get used to not having to do it myself, but it is nice to have the option when I need it.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - being intentional about not becoming too dependent on it. 

When you're working with AI like Scaler's suggest feature, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I hate to admit it, but the plugin has most of the control when using this. While it's possible to change chords if I want to, the plugin is doing 100% of the work. All I do is hit the button and the chords just show up.

AI: I appreciate your honesty about that - it sounds like you have a really clear-eyed view of the dynamic there.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Because there are no good plugins for the ""turn this idea into an actual piece of music"" part of the process, not a whole lot has changed. The only real difference is that writers block doesn't last as long since the few generative plugins I have can help with that.

AI: That makes sense - so it's really targeted to that specific challenge rather than transforming your whole workflow.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Obviously, the main concern I have is that one day there will not be any more jobs for people like me. I don't think AI will be able to fully replace humans for creative tasks, but this fact really doesn't matter either way. Companies won't hire people for things like game audio or scoring a tv ad if a cheap ai service can do it at a good enough level.

AI: That's a really nuanced point - the distinction between what AI can actually do versus what companies might choose to use it for based on cost alone.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: The main issue I have with these AI apps, as I mentioned before, is that they are simply useless to me as a composer once I get past the brainstorming stage. Ai music services like udio are fun to mess around with, but aren't really useable for professional use in their current stage. They only allow users to download the audio output, not the raw midi data to use in a DAW or sheet music to hand to musicians. I've also noticed a lot of these services just straight up don't understand musical terms at all in my prompt, even if it's something as simple as ""give me an upbeat string quartet in this key at this tempo.""

AI: That's really insightful - the gap between generating audio and providing the underlying musical structure that you'd actually need for professional work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps specifically with writer's block without changing your overall workflow, and your realistic view of the industry concerns around cost versus capability.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yeah, there is other stuff I'd like to add. I don't make great use of AI plugins now because they are just good for the brainstorming process. But if there was a plugin that could take a melody or chord progression I've written, and generate the beginnings of a form like a sonata or an example piece to give me an idea of how it would sound when finished, or automatically generate all the melodic alterations, (retrograde, retrograde inversion, etc) I would absolutely buy that plugin. It would really save me a lot of time!

AI: That's fascinating - so you're envisioning AI tools that could handle more of the structural and compositional development work, like taking your core musical ideas and exploring different formal arrangements or transformations of them. It sounds like there's a real opportunity for AI to assist with the more technical, time-intensive parts of composition while still keeping you in control of the creative vision.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about both the current limitations and the potential future applications of AI in music composition will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hi, sounds good! Let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Well I'm a Graphic Designer, there are multiple different projects depending on the day. I've created many powerpoint templates for my job, worked on logos, and generally just try to keep the brand image consistent throughout different types of media.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of work - from PowerPoint templates to logos to brand consistency across different media. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: So typically I find myself asking for help when it comes to brainstorming. I'll have a general idea of what I want to do, but look to AI to see if there are any possible enhancements. I'll also sometimes find myself using it to sort of check my work. I'll feed it my ideas and see if there is anything I'm overlooking. Generally if I'm really stuck somewhere I might use it as inspiration to move forward in the project in a way I hadn't previously thought of.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI more as a brainstorming partner and a sounding board rather than for the actual design execution. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yeah, as far as using it for brainstorming or a soundboard, I feel as though the work would come off as inauthentic if I used it for any of the actual design execution. It feels as there would be a sense of plagiarism and AI created art rather than human design. A recent project that comes to mind was dealing with the creation of a logo for a client. I had several mock up designs and wanted to figure out how to best match the brand identity. Asking Ai how switching certain color palettes might shift brand perception and creating a dialogue, asking it questions such as if a minimalist approach could have the same impact as serif-forward direction in the emotional aspects of the design. It felt like discussing the project with a well educated coworker.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're making between using AI for strategic thinking versus execution. You mentioned it felt like discussing the project with a well-educated coworker when you were exploring those color palette and typography decisions.

When you're having those dialogues with AI about brand perception and design direction, how would you describe who's driving the creative decisions? Is it more like you're the director getting input, or does it feel more collaborative than that?

User: I'd say I feel more like a director getting input. While it's definitely more casual than this in a typical sense, I do feel as though I already have the specific vison that the model is helping me work through. It's answering my questions and I'm certainly the one going through all the work. It's more collaborative in a sense, but not on an equal level.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're maintaining creative control while leveraging AI's ability to help you think through different aspects of your vision.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It's definitely sped things up for me. In the past it would take a while to pull information from scattered sources. AI is there as a sort of all in one source of information. What I might have Googled and sorted through pages of information to find can now be answered in a quick question or two.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds really valuable - having that consolidated source instead of hunting through multiple resources.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I think the main concern with AI in the art field in general is people using it instead of their own creative images. AI art is a growing problem in the sense of inauthenticity.

AI: That concern about authenticity really connects to what you mentioned earlier about feeling like using AI for actual execution would be plagiarism. 

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As a tool, I see AI being used for similar things that I use it for now. I think the brainstorming help it provides is very useful. I think it can evolve a bit and play more of a role as an educator for a new grad or someone starting out a getting a feel for the work for the first time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your clear distinction between using AI as a strategic thinking partner versus for actual design execution, and how you maintain that sense of authenticity in your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think everything has been covered!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming partner while maintaining creative authenticity, and your perspective on how it's streamlined your research process, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached this balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving the human creative vision in your work. Have a great rest of your day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a generalist creative, so I do photography, photoshop/compositing, art direction, graphic design etc.

AI: That's a really diverse skill set! With all those different creative disciplines you work in, I'm curious - walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: AI has been most useful in handling my admin tasks, like keeping track of client info, responding to emails etc. I use Photoshops AI denoise, and occasionally Generative Fill in my photography work. I've also used Firefly and Stable Diffusion to iterate on initial concepts for illustration jobs.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you on both the administrative side and the creative side. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: For the above illustration project, I had to produce a large suite of variations of a basic design. AI allowed me to easily and quickly iterate on my base illustration into a multitude of new versions. It worked well for this particular project.

AI: Tell me more about that process of iterating with AI on your base illustration. How did you work with the AI to create those variations - what was that back and forth like?

User: I completed my base illustration by using a hand drawn image that was modified in Firefly, iterated on, then redrawn again by hand. Next, this finalised base illustration was turned into many aesthetic variations in Stable Diffusion

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - going from hand-drawn to AI iteration, back to hand-drawn, and then using AI again for variations. When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions throughout that process?

User: Even when using something like Stable Diffusion (i.e. a tool that ""gives a lot of  control,"" using AI feels like a bit of a crapshoot. I understand what I want my final image to look like, but it's difficult to ""art direct"" the various models. I've experienced similar things using Suno.AI: regardless of the prompt, a lot of the final output seems to be heavily dependant on a random seed. In the future, I'd love to better be able to direct these models so there's less ""randomness"" involved in the creation process

AI: That's really insightful - the tension between having a clear vision and the unpredictability of the output. You mentioned wanting to better ""art direct"" the models in the future. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has this randomness factor affected how you approach projects or your creative process more broadly?

User: Not really, if anything, for genuinely creative work, AI feels like an impediment of sorts. At the moment, its only truly useful if there's no budget for hiring a human illustrator. However, using  LLMs has been tremendously helpful in taking the stress out of various admin-related aspects of  creative work (analysing analytics, helping with client comms etc.)

AI: That's a really honest perspective - AI as helpful for admin but potentially an impediment for the genuinely creative aspects. You touched on budget considerations there. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My main income source in creative work is photography-based. I don't see photography as immediately being as negatively affected by AI as much as illustration, music production, writing etc. I also think ""fine art"" in general is sort of immune to being damaged by AI. I don't believe there's any sense in being a luddite in day-to-day commercial work. Although I ""get where people are coming from"" when they're mad that people are using AI for illustration work, realistically, the people using AI tools would not have paid for a human artist anyway. I do feel for established illustrators who have had their distinctive style ""ripped"" by AI models.

AI: You've raised some really nuanced points there - the distinction between different creative fields' vulnerability to AI, and the economic realities versus the style appropriation concerns. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I look forward to Photoshop's integrated AI tools improving. At the moment, it's clearly early days, but they're getting really good. I think they're already extremely useful for doing cutouts etc. (the sort of work that would usually be very time-consuming or offshored to cheap labor) and Generative Fill is decent, but will be amazing very shortly. I most look forward to AI getting better at helping me with the admin stuff I mentioned earlier, though.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI being more of an impediment for genuinely creative work right now, while being genuinely helpful for admin tasks and certain technical aspects like cutouts in Photoshop.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nah, I think that's all. Thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the different ways AI impacts various creative disciplines, the challenges with directing AI models, and that honest distinction between where AI helps versus hinders your creative process - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. I'm ready to begin.

AI: Perfect. Let's start with getting to know a bit about your work. Could you tell me about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer, primarily of science fiction and fantasy, so a project for me would be a book or a series of books, which can take months or years from start to finish. Rarely, I write a short story and that's more a matter of somewhere from hours to days, maybe weeks. But however big/long the project, they all go through similar phases of developing an idea; doing some pre-writing research, world-building, character development, initial plot development; the writing itself, which often includes revisiting earlier stages; an editing/revision/rewrite stage; and the final polish stage of editing. It's not a neat and tidy checklist of steps, but those are the general stages.

AI: That's a great overview of your process. Now I'm curious about how AI fits into that journey. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process - where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I will sometimes use AI for research purposes, to help me get an overview of a topic and ideas on where I might need to do some deeper learning or give me ideas I might want to expand on, possibly point me toward resources where I can go and do more extensive research myself. I prefer not to rely on AI for research or learning, because it's still prone to inaccuracy and hallucination, but it's sometimes convenient for rounding up general information and giving me a starting point. And also just because I enjoy learning about things for myself, so I don't want to give up that part of the process. In the past, I'd do a Google search and check links and read general articles to get an overview point and then start doing the deeper research from there, so AI is essentially doing that initial Google search and general reading and compiling it for me.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI as that initial research springboard while maintaining your own deeper learning process. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I'm not a scientist, but I enjoy writing sci fi, so learning the science that underpins some of the usual science fiction elements is part of the job. I had developed a planet with a specific set of characteristics that I needed for the purpose of the story, but it was not Earth-like, so I asked AI to help me determine things like weather and day/night cycles and what color the sky would be and, most importantly, what other things might be different which I hadn't even thought about. It provided me with a list of suggestions and, most importantly, reasons for those suggestions, so I was able to do deeper research into what it was telling me. It got a couple of details not quite right, but they were details I might not have thought to include at all otherwise.

AI: That sounds like a really productive collaboration - getting both the suggestions and the reasoning behind them so you could verify and build on them. When you're working with AI in situations like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am definitely the decision-maker. I use AI responses the same way I use any other piece of nonfiction or even fiction that I read. Or for that matter, any other media or life experience. I see the sparks of what might be useful to include in a story and what to do with that spark.

AI: That's a clear sense of agency you maintain. I'm curious - what aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I spend less time clicking links and reading general knowledge articles to compile basic information during the research phase of writing. In much the same way that pre-computer, I had to go to the library and drag physical books to a table and page through them and make notes with pen and paper but then having the same (and more) information available at my fingertips on a computer made research more efficient and convenient, now using AI makes the process a little more efficient and convenient.

AI: That's a helpful analogy - seeing it as the next step in research efficiency. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I personally don't have a ton of concerns about AI in the field of writing. There's pirating, but there's always been pirating. There's AI writing stories and ""stealing"" readers, allegedly, but if readers think AI-written stories are ""good,"" then that's their business, and they're probably not my market anyhow. Computers and ebooks and indie publishing made it both harder and easier to be a writer. AI makes it both harder and easier to be a writer. Honestly, most writers aren't making a commercial living from writing anyhow, and many more of them than will admit it aren't in it for the money, anyhow.

AI: That's a really pragmatic perspective on the market changes. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Assuming AI improves at providing accurate information and not hallucinating, it may continue to make the research phase of my writing process more efficient. On the other hand, it's not entirely about efficiency. I enjoy digging around for information and learning new things, so I don't necessarily want my information summarized and spoon fed to me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining agency as the decision-maker and your analogy of AI as another step in the evolution of research tools - from physical libraries to computers to AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't have anything to add.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I found your balanced perspective on AI as a research efficiency tool - while maintaining your enjoyment of the learning process itself - really valuable. Have a great day!"
creativity_0022,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. I'm ready to start.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work involves designing and leading workshops for businesses in many subject areas. As part of this work, I develop presentations, ebooks, training content and many other types of deliverables. These products always involve images, sometimes video, and require the use of graphic design elements. Sometimes this graphic design makes use of company logos, colours, and other in-house design elements but more often I have free reign to ensure the products I create best suite the type of workshop I design and facilitate. If I am doing a specific workshop, such as a design sprint, I am quickly capturing the work of the workshop attendees and using this to create products that represent the steps taken at various points in the workshop. To do this, I have to create documentation rapidly that is professional, visually appealing and can be used as part of the final deliverables I submit to the contracting company. I know that the more creative and visually appealing my content is the better it is received (with a professional focus of course!). I am often engaged in change initiatives, such as workplace culture, and create extensive interactive training files meant to engage staff in responsive learning. This means I focus my work on interactive learning scenarios rather than the read/watch videos and answer multiple choice questions that are so ineffective!

AI: That sounds like incredibly dynamic work - you're essentially creating custom learning experiences on the fly while also producing all the visual and interactive content to support them. The rapid documentation during workshops while maintaining that professional, visually appealing quality must be quite a juggling act.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI in many different ways in my work. Sometimes if I feel ""stuck"" at the beginning of a project I will use an AI tool to brainstorm various approaches to a specific subject, moving from a general overall view to specific features, such as activities for workshop participants, content for digital files, suggested graphic features (colour, elements, layout), questions for company contacts, etc. I often use AI to create specific images I want to insert in my presentations and final deliverables. I use AI for video generation as well, although I often don't use these videos as they are not quite at the quality level I want. I find AI tools where I can generate non-realistic image based video (cartoon, line drawing, etc.) and off-screen narration most effective. I have successfully used AI augmented reality tools and that was lots of fun and very engaging for workshop participants. I also use AI to critique and edit my final documents, or to add design elements to almost finished products. I actually use AI tools a lot!

AI: It sounds like AI has become deeply integrated across your entire workflow - from initial brainstorming all the way through to final polishing. I'm particularly intrigued by your mention of the AR tools being engaging for participants.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: A recent project where I used AI involved creating immersive learning for a nation wide veterinary company. Each veterinary location was owner managed but made use of company software, followed common procedural steps with business operations (including training) and worked to meet the business objectives of headquarters. I was asked to create training files that could be used at any location to train the various staff members commonly hired (front desk staff, lab techs, vet techs, vets, etc.) To do this I used AI software through a company called Thinglink. Using this AI software allowed me to take static images and information and make them interactive, including opportunities to use augmented reality. I absolutely loved the creative options I had through using Thinglink's AI and software platform. It made everything so much easier to create and share.

AI: That Thinglink project sounds fascinating - transforming static training materials into interactive, AR-enhanced experiences for such a diverse set of roles. You mentioned you ""absolutely loved"" the creative options and that it made things ""so much easier.""

Tell me more about that - what specifically felt easier or more creative compared to how you might have approached this type of project before AI tools?

User: First of all, I didn't have to code anything which was excellent because I don't code at the level needed to produce interactive files. AI took care of that for me. It made the learning design process easier and quicker which kept me from getting bogged down in small details that were not central to the project (it kept me on track).  Another thing I liked was the help the AI tool gave with enduring content was accessible to many types of learners. In the past, I would need to access many different tools to create the content I was able to create using one AI driven tool. This saved me time which allowed me to focus more on producing engaging content rather than merging files and working with tools that don't always like to blend together.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI essentially removed technical barriers that were pulling your focus away from the core creative and pedagogical work. You went from juggling multiple incompatible tools to having one integrated solution that handled the coding complexity.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Right now, I would say that the back and forth with AI tools is a little stilted but this is getting better. Sometimes the ""follow up"" questions are repetitive or redundant and I find that frustrating. So I would say that I am driving the collaboration and creative decision making, but that seems reasonable given the current working relationship. I like taking an idea and expanding on it, often to the point where the final product is very different than the initial concept. I like my work and I want to decide what to keep and where to go next. I think you were right earlier - Ai definitely removes technical barriers (and I like tech!) that are frustrating/difficult and provides a way to enhance creativity so I am better able to meet my creative objectives. In the past, I had to ""dumb down"" many of the things I wanted to produce because either the tech wasn't readily available or I didn't have the knowledge to use it effectively.

AI: That's a powerful point about not having to ""dumb down"" your creative vision anymore. It sounds like AI is acting more like an advanced toolkit that finally matches your creative ambitions, rather than a creative partner per se.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Instead of using stock photos and videos, or having to use photo editing and video production software, I can now use AI tools that create what I want when I type in text or use something I already have - like a photo or presentation - to produce a unique image or video. That has really helped a lot. I save time and end up with better, more unique products for my clients.

AI: That shift from stock imagery to custom, unique visuals created on-demand is huge - especially for someone creating materials for so many different companies and contexts. It sounds like you're getting both efficiency gains and better creative outcomes.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Everyone (I think) has concerns about how AI affects their area of work, both now and in the future. I know that as AI becomes more effective in its use of information and precision in identifying what is needed, say for a presentation or training, people in my role will have less of a share in the workplace. I do struggle with the fact that even if I copyright my work, it is in digital format which means it will be used at some point by AI to complete a project I won't be paid for. It's impossible right now to keep track of how my work is used by others in effective ways, especially when final products are being purchased by companies, even if I register processes. It is definitely an area of concern and debate and comes down to discussions about ethics and AI. Right now, I see creative, unique process as still being human but also see the definite possibility of AI taking over my work.  As much of AI development is commercially driven with profit being most important, I worry that concepts of ethical design will be left behind. Not that every company developing AI is unconcerned with ethics of course.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the immediate issue of your work potentially being used to train AI systems that could eventually replace you, and the broader worry about commercial pressures potentially overriding ethical considerations in AI development.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think that AI's role in my creative work will continue to evolve rapidly. It is amazing the ways AI already makes tasks that were so difficult just a couple of years of ago (coding, image editing, video production, ideation) so easy now. Five years ago if you had told me I could produce training files with imbedded augmented reality easily, I definitely would be skeptical. Now, things have really changed. I predict I will continue to seek out AI tools that are multi-functional so I don't have to flip from one piece of software to another to create products that meet my design and content standards.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has enabled you to realize your full creative vision instead of having to ""dumb down"" ideas due to technical limitations, and your honest reflections about both the exciting possibilities and legitimate concerns around AI's rapid evolution in creative fields.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the shift from technical limitation to creative enablement, the evolution from stock resources to custom-generated content, and your balanced perspective on both the opportunities and challenges ahead will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the exciting possibilities and the real concerns you have about the future of your field. That kind of nuanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the full picture of how AI is reshaping creative work.

Thanks again, and I hope you have a great rest of your day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I create simple content for Muffin Break, a cafe retail chain in AUstralia. I recently started a marketing role in a startup in afterhours and have been exploring video and image generating through different platforms

AI: That's really interesting - so you're working across both established retail marketing and startup environments. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I generate prompts for videos/images from AI as they can provide a better description for me. I also generate a lot of copywriting from AI like captions. I use platforms to generate and fine-tune image too - should I provide examples of the AI models?

AI: You don't need to list all the specific models right now, but I'd love to hear more about how you're using AI for those prompts and copywriting.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I had to generate a tagline for a coffee bean award our company has won. We won an award in alternative milk, decaf, expresso and milk based coffee - basically everything. We want a tagline that connects to customers, showcases our versatility and still be concise. I felt like different models have different abilities to generate a tagline. I was happy with the results and had a conversation to explore all possible options.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive approach - using the AI almost like a brainstorming partner to explore different directions for that tagline.

When you're working with AI like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It really depends on the model I am using. I prefer chatbots with follow up questions, as without them it feels one way. For models that provides follow-ups and their own thoughts or perspectives, I think AI does consider things that I haven't considered before. Not to mention the depth of wordings that AI can provide. With the right prompting, I see copywriters role being deminished and the demand for them would decrease.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're making between different types of AI interactions - the follow-up questions really seem to change the dynamic for you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think it would be copy writing. I need the idea myself but AI helps me execute them very efficiently. I think image and video generation is still not up to standard for my liking (I have been using free models for them). 80% of the images and videos are not what was desired. I think having editing function would be a game changing feature for these image generation models.

AI: So it sounds like AI has really transformed your copywriting workflow, but the visual content generation still has some gaps for you.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My concern how our creativity would be diminished and everyone would have similar ideas based on AI models. It is such a shortcut when you can have 10 captions generated for you in a second that is 80% better than your own written one, so whats the point of writing it ourselves? Also AI provides a lot of generic content in terms of writing marketing briefs and people that are not professionals would not know how to tell which one is which.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - both the homogenization of creative output and people not being able to distinguish quality. It sounds like you're seeing both the power and the potential pitfalls firsthand.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see free models having more advanced image/video generation models. I see a streamline of prompt generating and feeding within the same conversation to generate amazing images. I also think the step up on AI reliance would actually be surprisingly slow, as people come to realise that their biggest assets are still their own brain. I think AI will progress in a marginally slower pace than the past 5 years in terms of creative work or in general.

AI: That's a really interesting prediction about the pace slowing down, especially your point about people rediscovering the value of their own thinking.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how different AI models create different collaborative dynamics - that distinction between one-way versus conversational interactions seems really important for how the creative process unfolds.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced differences between AI models, the current limitations in visual content generation, and your thoughtful concerns about creativity and quality have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

User: Sounds good, I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a writer, a freelance author, editor, and indie publisher. I have written and published a couple of nonfiction books about fibromyalgia on Amazon, and done editing and assisted with publishing on about 5 other books written by other authors. A project I'm currently working on is a devotional intended for people with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, or other chronic illness, focused toward helping them figure out how they function according to God's will for their lives, and it's intended to be the first in a series of devotionals, each one with 40 days or entries, and each one also designed to encourage journaling, so each entry/day will include a journaling prompt at the end, and the print version will have a few pages of ruled paper for journaling after each devotional. I am working right now on the content of the first one, and once I have it finished, arranged, edited, etc, I will design the cover and publish it to Amazon and possibly other avenues, in digital and paperback versions. does that answer sufficiently?

AI: That's a wonderful overview, thank you. It sounds like you have a really comprehensive approach to the publishing process - from writing through design and distribution. The devotional series sounds like a meaningful project, especially with the journaling component.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: For my writing and publishing, I typically use AI quite a bit in the research phase, especially in searching out bible verses or passages that fit the material/subject matter, and especially finding verses that aren't as commonly used for what I'm writing about. For example, in my current book, Habakkuk is coming into play quite a bit. Then I will sometimes reach out to AI for help if I get stuck during my writing with what to say about something or how to express a particular idea. I tend, in my own words, to get too wordy sometimes, and sometimes I have trouble being direct or efficient in expressing an idea, so I'll use AI to get feedback or ideas on how I can say something. And then in the editing phase, I am an avid proofreader, but I will use AI to double check my work and get final feedback. Also to find things that might not be super obvious, like an extra space where it doesn't belong. I have not previously used it for cover design, but I might end up incorporating some of that going forward.

AI: That's really interesting how you've integrated AI across multiple phases - from research through final proofreading. I'm particularly intrigued by your use of AI for finding less commonly used biblical passages like from Habakkuk.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I haven't had other major projects, because I've been working on the current one off and on for awhile , and have recently dealt with a lot of illness. But I can tell you that kind of a sub-portion of the current project where AI was quite useful was when I needed to figure out how to organize my devotionals for the book. I had all of these devotionals which I had written individually but didn't want to just put them in a random order, or something kind of arbitrary like alphabetical, and I didn't necessarily want to go in biblical order by the passage I used for each one, but something that would be meaningful for the readers. So through discussions with a couple of models I was able to decide on 8 categories, with each one having 4 smaller devotionals, and 1 that was more comprehensive, so that it was essentially 8 sets of 5 devotionals, with each covering an area like accepting your illness or God's path, understanding why God allows illness in His followers and how He uses it, and ways that we can still serve and God can still use us, despite, or even because of, our challenges. That help in coming up with the 8 subdivisions, and especially in organizing the devotionals into categories, was incredibly helpful. I felt overwhelmed going in, but by the end I was very grateful for this new tool.

AI: That sounds like such a valuable collaboration - taking what could have been an overwhelming organizational challenge and turning it into a meaningful structure for your readers. I love how you ended up with that thoughtful framework of 8 categories with 5 devotionals each.

When you're working with AI like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It's usually me in the driver's seat, but the models I've used have been very collaborative, making helpful suggestions that sometimes I would never have thought of- so although the AI isn't making the creative decisions, it is very creatively involved in the collab.

AI: That's a great way to put it - you're driving but the AI is creatively involved in the collaboration. It sounds like there's a real back-and-forth happening where the AI can surprise you with suggestions you wouldn't have considered.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'd say it primarily has just become a bit faster and easier, like when I used to do all manual proofreading/editing, it took a lot longer because I would read and reread, literally forward and backward, to make sure I caught everything, and then I would do word level, sentence level, and paragraph level edits, with multiple rereads for each. Now I don't have to spend quite so much  time on it. And creatively, it's been a great sounding board for ideas, like with the organization of the book, where I can tell it what I am trying to do from a very high level, and ask for thoughts and ideas on how to accomplish it, and we can go back and forth with iterations of the ideas, and it will make suggestions that I might not go with precisely but will sometimes spark a different way of viewing things that will help me decide on the right approach.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - AI as both a time-saver and a creative sounding board. It sounds like it's particularly valuable in those moments where you need to step back and see your work from a different angle.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: For myself I don't really have particular concerns on an individual level, but for my field I have concerns in people leaning too heavily on AI for writing and creative tasks, and its impact on people's ability to think for themselves. I have heard people (or read, on social media, forums, etc) talking about that they just put in a high level concept and tell the ai to write a chapter, and then another, and it basically writes the whole book for them. I am concerned that will lead to a lot of books that are very derivative and ultimately restatements of the same things, but not truly creative. And similarly, maybe more importantly, it's being used, to my understanding, by students for creative tasks in schools, and I'm very concerned about the impact that will have on their learning to think and reason on their own, not to mention the ability to simply write something coherent.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns about the broader implications. It sounds like you see a real distinction between using AI as a collaborative tool - like you do - versus having it generate entire pieces of work. The point about students particularly resonates - that there's something important about learning to think through problems yourself.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'm not really sure yet- to some extent it might depend on how AI itself evolves. But I am fairly set on the idea that creative works need to originate from the human brain, and that I really don't think people should be able to publish and receive royalties from something that was mostly produced by AI... I don't have a problem with that stuff being put out there, but It feels wrong to me that someone can claim a ""creative"" work, when they didn't really do any of the creating themselves, if that makes sense. I have a real thing about that, so I, myself, will probably continue to do the bulk of my writing the old fashioned way, and as you said, use AI as a tool for brainstorming, organization, research, etc, and double-checking my work for mistakes.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that human creative core while leveraging AI as a support tool. Your distinction between creating versus claiming credit for AI-generated work really gets to the heart of some important questions about authorship and creativity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative sounding board while maintaining clear boundaries about where the creative work should originate, and your concerns about the broader implications for both publishing and education.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of at this time. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI as a powerful collaborative tool while preserving the essential human creativity at the core of your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Best of luck with your devotional series - it sounds like a really meaningful project that will help a lot of people. Take care!"

User: Sounds great! No questions!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do a lot of different creative work. My most recent work has consisted of crocheting neon bucket hats for some teenagers going to a festival. I also do watercolor, macrame, and I write stories and poems. I've also sold furniture I've refurbished among other things.

AI: That's such a diverse range of creative work! It sounds like you really enjoy exploring different mediums and practical applications. I can picture those neon bucket hats being perfect for a festival.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I don't use AI too often because I really enjoy my creative process, but it as been really helpful for some tasks. I will use it to edit things that I've written or help find a suitable color palette for a painting idea I have. If I get stuck on a macrame knot or crochet stitch it has helped me quicker than searching myself does.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you use AI more as a targeted helper for specific moments when you hit a roadblock, rather than as a constant creative companion. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Actually, this is really cool. I saw an image on the internet a couple weeks ago and it instantly inspired me to want to paint something. I uploaded the image to AI and explained my idea for the painting and asked the AI to pull out the colors from the image that I would need and tell me the names. That was very helpful because I didn't have to go through the tedious task of mixing colors and doing a sample sheet to find the perfect shades.

AI: That's such a practical use! I love how you turned what could have been a tedious color-matching process into something much more efficient. It sounds like the AI helped you get to the actual painting part faster.

When you're working with AI in moments like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm definitely driving the creative decisions. It was my idea to begin with, the AI just helped me streamline the process so I could get to the fun part quicker. I am very cautious of keeping the creativity mine. I'm worried about AI taking humanity from the arts so I try to use AI as little as possible.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a tool to handle the more mechanical aspects while preserving the human creative core. I can hear that maintaining your own creative agency is really important to you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Just that I'm a little quicker now. The tedious tasks that come along with art, mostly the planning, are a little easier now. MY art and MY creative process are still the same.

AI: I can really hear how intentional you are about preserving your core creative process. It sounds like AI has become a way to handle some of the prep work without touching the heart of what makes your art yours.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Just what I said earlier, I hate that humanity could be taken out of art. Even when humans create really beautiful things people will think it's AI or something. Though, the value of real true proven human art could be appreciated more in the future too, who knows?

AI: That's such an insightful perspective - the idea that authentic human creativity might actually become more valued as AI becomes more prevalent. It's interesting how you're thinking about both the risks and potential opportunities.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Hopefully not at all. I feel like I've already included AI as much as I'd like to.

AI: That's a really clear boundary you've set for yourself. It sounds like you've found that sweet spot where AI helps with just enough of the tedious tasks without encroaching on what you love most about creating.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI only for the mechanical prep work while fiercely protecting the human heart of your creativity - and how you think authentic human art might actually become more valued over time.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency and using AI as a very targeted tool for specific tasks will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about your concerns and boundaries - that kind of thoughtful approach to integrating AI while preserving what makes your work uniquely yours is exactly the kind of perspective we were hoping to learn about.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work as a screenwriter for film and television. ""Typical"" varies quite a lot in my line of work. The circumstances around one project are never quite the same. However, you could probably categorise it into three buckets: original writing, rewriting, writing for hire. If I'm doing original writing, I will come up with an idea for a story, determine whether it's best suited to TV or film, then start to ideate on story, characters etc, until I have a sense of the overall plot of the feature or pilot/first season of the TV show. I'll then most likely write it on spec and have my agent send it out, rather than try pitching it out. For rewriting (usually film), I will digest the materials that need work, dissect flaws and strengths, how they can be improved, whether I am the right person to do so, and will then pitch my take on what/how to improve the project to the filmmakers involved. If I get the job, I will then try and execute this take, enhancing the script as a whole along the way, in addition to the specifics in my pitch. Usually, there will be at least one revision step where I can adjust/course-correct/inject further feedback from the filmmakers. In terms of writing for hire, I will be interviewed by show-runners, filmmakers etc. based on the strength of my previous work and then be invited to make suggestions or pitch my take on underlying material or ideas. My job will be to serve whoever is in charge of the creative vision, enabling their intentions and, if given the job, helping to execute this vision.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview of the different types of projects you work on. It sounds like there's quite a bit of variation in terms of creative control and collaboration depending on which bucket a project falls into.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Usually during my own original writing, particularly at an early ideas stage when outlining, I might use AI to say, ""Give me ten surnames for a man from Barnsbury born in 1971"". Usually, I will not get the ideal response from asking that question, but it will send me on a path towards what I actually want by giving some examples and eliminating what I don't want.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI more as a starting point or catalyst rather than for the final answer. Tell me more about that process of elimination and how AI helps send you down that path toward what you actually want.

User: Correct. I have found it most useful as a starting point in my own work, it saves me time from searching for inspiration on a broader canvas and instead delivers more quickly the sort of thing I'm looking for. Sometimes its easier to determine what you don't want than knowing exactly what you do; i.e. you probably have a ball-park idea of what you're looking for, but might not be able to articulate it exactly, a sort of ""know it when I see it"" creative aspect.

AI: That ""know it when I see it"" aspect is really insightful - it sounds like AI helps you externalize possibilities so you can react to them and refine your instincts. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I used it for generating character surnames in a feature film I wrote. I also used it as a way of iterating idioms, which where part of a joke in a character's dialogue - the dialogue wasn't sounding quite right, or quite as funny as what I was reaching for. Again, the AI didn't give me something better, but by combining and refining its suggestions I was able to reach something I was happy with.

AI: That's a great example of the iterative process you described earlier. When you were working with those idioms for the character's dialogue, what did that back-and-forth feel like? How did you know when you'd landed on something that worked?

User: The back and forth was pretty limited. I asked for iterations based on ""bull in a china shop"", which it listed. I was then able to hone in on ""loose cannon"" asking for more like that. I then asked it to generate examples a few more times before settling on which of the examples I thought was closest to my intention.

AI: So it sounds like you had a pretty clear sense of direction - you knew ""loose cannon"" was closer to what you wanted than ""bull in a china shop."" When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I don't think I would really describe it as a collaboration, more a more advanced search/indexing, whereas I would consider collaboration to allow some level of independence of thought from the collaborator. As it stands, I am the sole driver of creative decisions, based on years of experience, exposure and personal taste.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - viewing it more as an advanced search tool rather than a creative collaborator. Given that you're the sole driver of creative decisions, what aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this capacity?

User: Rather than wait for inspiration to come to me, I can make my creative process move faster by trying to be more active/targeted.

AI: That shift from waiting for inspiration to actively seeking it out sounds significant. You mentioned you primarily use AI for your original writing projects. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: A lot of people are worried about AI taking away screenwriter's jobs. I am less worried about that. I'm more worried about producers/directors using AI to generate a first draft, then needing a writer to rewrite it to a high-enough quality, while stiffing them on the money they would have received if they had gone though a normal development process from scratch. I suspect AI's presence in writing will create a more homogenous and good/okay base playing field. Ultimately, this will serve to make outstanding screenwriters and original story-tellers more outstanding, provided that of course, it is humans reviewing the scripts, as the post-facto nature of any AI analysis of screenwriting would otherwise mean the importance of originality would likely be downplayed in an evaluative model, as it simply wouldn't have the sample cases to compare it against - think MOONLIGHT or EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE; both are Oscar winners, making significant sums of money across the world, but prior to MOONLIGHT there had never been a Black gay Oscar-winning film, likewise EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE's fusion of martial-arts, sci-fi, familial relationships and 1/2nd generation immigrant culture is without peer.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you're less concerned about replacement and more about how AI might change the economic structure and evaluation of screenwriting. Your point about originality is particularly striking - that AI evaluation might miss truly groundbreaking work because it lacks precedent to compare against.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think using AI tools to create proof-of-concepts for pitches or even support green-lights/financing/commissioning will become commonplace, helping to lower a sense of risk for people controlling the cash. Without total authorial control over what it is able to generate, I don't see it being able to supplant physical production (real actors on sound stages/locations etc), but I hope it would lower the barrier to entry in what is an expensive and time consuming creative endeavour. I can totally see myself doing a work-in-progress AI generated short/scenes/sequence as a way to sell a project I am working on.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - using AI as a visualization and proof-of-concept tool to help sell projects. It sounds like you see it potentially democratizing the pitching process by making it easier to show rather than just tell.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might change the economics of screenwriting and your distinction between AI as an advanced search tool versus true collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think that's it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an accelerated creative catalyst rather than a collaborator, and your thoughtful analysis of how it might reshape the industry's economic and creative landscape, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!"
creativity_0027,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds pretty self-explanatory! Just hope I can answer everything you need to help with your research

AI: Perfect! I appreciate your willingness to help. Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So my main business I have that involves creative work is using a Cricut machine to vinyl items such as T-shirts & clothing and also vases, wine bottles, glasses, mugs etc as gifts. I can pretty much vinyl most things including photos.  A typical project to me could be designing a logo for a T-shirt, cutting this into vinyl and then applying it with heat.

AI: That sounds like really hands-on, personalized work! I can imagine each project has its own unique requirements depending on what you're creating and who it's for.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Oh it does, it can be so time consuming depending on the design. I have to use a special tool to weed out the vinyl before transferring it. Imagine at Christmas when you have loads to prepare.

AI: That sounds like a lot of intricate work, especially during busy seasons like Christmas! I can imagine the weeding process alone must be quite time-intensive.

I'm curious - in all of that process you described, from designing logos to cutting and applying vinyl, do you use any AI tools along the way? Maybe for design work or any other part of your workflow?

User: I certainly do! I literally get mental block when trying to think of ideas so I use AI to generate these ideas for me, usually Gemini. Gemini will give me design ideas to generate in Cricut and also gift ideas involving vinyl.

AI: That's really interesting! Mental block is something a lot of creative people can relate to, and it sounds like Gemini has become a helpful brainstorming partner for you.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Now let me think, I work on so many projects I don't know whether I am coming or going most days!!  The most recent project I can think of was a friend wanted me to make a unique, memoriable gift for their mum who was turning 90 years old. I didn't want it to be the usual cushion or vase so I asked Gemini to provide me with a list of gift ideas to make. The ideas that Gemini came out with I never would have dreamt of in my wildest dreams, they were so thoughtful and out of the box.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of breakthrough you were hoping for! I love that Gemini helped you move beyond the typical options to something more special.

Tell me more about that - what was it like when you saw those unexpected, thoughtful ideas come back from Gemini? How did it feel to get suggestions that were so different from what you might have come up with on your own?

User: To be honest it was a relief and like a weight had lifted off of me. I didn't want to let me friend or her mum down with a rubbish gift idea which would look bad on me but I just could not think of anything. I also had so much going on that, honestly, I just didn't have the time to think either. Gemini saved me time. I felt happy and satisfied if that's how you can describe it I guess. Also optimistic, knowing there was this ability to generate insane ideas to make my business amazing.

AI: That relief you described really comes through - it sounds like Gemini didn't just help with ideas, but actually took some pressure off you during a busy time. 

When you're working with AI like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I don't quite understand this question? do you mean how do I feel working with Gemini to create these ideas?

AI: Yes, exactly! I'm curious about the dynamic between you and Gemini when you're working together. For instance, are you directing Gemini with specific requests, or is it more like Gemini is leading with suggestions that you then choose from? How do you decide what to actually make from the ideas it gives you?

User: Well in this instant I literally just told Gemini the scope which was a gift for a 90th birthday, for a lady, has to be unique and different and Gemini took over and gave me the suggestions. There isn't a set formula I follow to pick which idea to have, I just go with my gut and the one I felt stood out as the most unique and also one I was obviously able to make.

AI: That makes perfect sense - trusting your instincts about what feels right and what's actually feasible for you to create. It sounds like you set the parameters and then let Gemini run with it, but you're still the one making the final creative call.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Nothing has really changed with my creative work since using AI, by using Gemini it has enabled me to create new ideas to make my business thrive and showcase my work and stand out from the crowd but I do still also create my own ideas too.

AI:

User: Nothing has really changed with my creative work since using AI, by using Gemini it has enabled me to create new ideas to make my business thrive and showcase my work and stand out from the crowd but I do still also create my own ideas too.

AI: That's a great distinction - so AI has added to your capabilities rather than replacing how you work. It sounds like you've found a balance between using Gemini for inspiration and still drawing on your own creativity too.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Regarding my own personal creative work, I do not have any concerns, AI only seems to help make life easier. If you are considering the creative field as a whole then some artists maybe worried about how AI can generate a creative piece of work in seconds when it would take them hours, even days and could ruin their livelihood. As I do not use AI on this level it does not affect me to that depth.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - recognizing that your use case is different from someone who might be creating full artwork from scratch. It sounds like for your business, AI is more of a brainstorming tool rather than doing the actual creative execution.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I really hope my predictions are correct on this one but over the next five years I would love you to be able to tell AI the design you would like in Cricut, for example, say you want to design ""Merry Christmas Mum"" on a wine bottle. you simply say this and the AI would be able to design this in the Cricut design space, including all of the correct measurements and then determine the correct tools to use to cut the design. It would then load the design to the Cricut machine and cut it and also have another tool to be able to weed the design also so all that is needed is to peel the design at the end to transfer. Having to plan the design in Cricut is so time consuming especially when adding pictures so having AI be able to do this, which I think is more than capable, would be a life saver.

AI: Wow, that's such a specific and vivid vision! You're describing a complete automation of the technical setup process - from design creation all the way through to the cutting and weeding. It really sounds like you've thought about exactly where the time bottlenecks are in your current workflow.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a brainstorming partner that relieves pressure without replacing your creative judgment, and your vision for how it could streamline the technical aspects of your work in the future.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no I think that is everything

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming tool, how it provides relief during busy periods, and your vision for future automation in the technical aspects of your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your process and share such specific examples. Best of luck with your Cricut business!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, all good, please fire away!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So I am an author, to date I have published two novels, both thriller novels with philosophical themes. I am currently writing a fantasy series.

AI: That's fascinating - thriller novels with philosophical themes sounds like a really compelling combination. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find that AI is a terrific way of becoming ""unstuck"". If I can give you an example, I required a way of describing an institution somewhat like a bank in a pre-industrial society. The list of suggestions given (I always ask for 10 plus suggestions) essentially rebooted my semantic field and I came up with the perfect description for what I wanted , triggered by the best suggestions. I use AI in this way both with descriptions for concepts (novel or adapted), or sometimes just word choices.

AI: That's a really interesting way to use AI - as a kind of semantic catalyst to break through creative blocks. It sounds like you're not taking the AI's suggestions directly, but rather they're sparking your own ideas.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: So I've recently been writing a new series called [REDACTED], with the first novel being called [REDACTED]. In addition to using it on a number of occasions as the catalyst as you say for word choices and conception descriptions, I also use it to talk though world-building consequences. For example, the word has two moons, I described their cycles to the model, and used it to determine the frequency of sacred nights on which both moons were full.

AI: That's a really practical application - using AI as a kind of world-building consultant to work through the logical implications of your fantasy elements. The dual moon calculation sounds like it would have been quite tedious to figure out manually.

When you're working with AI in these situations - whether for the semantic suggestions or the world-building calculations - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Oh, I am, absolutely, I don't really approach AI when stuck creatively, but rather when stuck in terms of something logistical, or in giving definition to a creative idea.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - so you're using AI more as a research assistant or analytical tool rather than as a creative partner. It sounds like the core creative vision and decisions remain entirely yours.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'd like to add, my experience with existing AI models is that they are overly eager to please, and so (though I'm sure this will change), I don't fully trust the model to be sufficiently critical and demanding as an editorial partner. The aspects of my work that have changed the most are time, even if an AI generated idea sits only as a place holder (though often the suggestions are great), I can move on from something that might have had me stuck for quite some time!

AI: That's a really insightful observation about AI being ""overly eager to please"" - and how that affects your trust in using it for more critical editorial feedback. The time savings aspect sounds significant though.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of writing?

User: I don't to be honest, I feel that AI is a tool, very much like the internet. While it can be abused, this will not be at the cost of human creativity, of the market for human creativity. Those who adapt best to the tool will benefit from it, even in the creative fields! I would love to get the point where AI operates as a full editorial partner

AI: It's refreshing to hear such an optimistic perspective! You seem to view AI as potentially enhancing rather than threatening creativity. You mentioned wanting AI to eventually operate as a full editorial partner - that sounds like it would require overcoming that ""eager to please"" limitation you noted.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would AI to evolve to the point that it has a deeper understanding of tone and style in shifting contexts. I would also want it to connect the dots (or see that the dots cannot be connected) over much larger bodies of text so that it can help to identify any and all plot holes in early drafts of novels. Essentially becoming this full editorial partner we've been discussing.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool for getting ""unstuck"" logistically rather than creatively, and your optimistic view of it as potentially becoming a true editorial partner once it develops better critical capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I've typically used a text based AI model, but it would be interesting to be able to use a voice based model so that I could remain on screen, and read a short passage, and hear a response (perhaps giving a different perspective, and certainly breaking concentration on the passage at hand to a lesser extent). Just thought I'd mention that. Anyway thank you!

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! I don't have any questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: You bet. I design and hand-paint custom shoes for people. A typical project includes planning the shoe design digitally, which is usually what takes longest. Once I have the thumbs up from the customer, I sketch the design onto the shoe. I then use paints and brushes to paint the design onto the shoe, using a matte protectant to seal and protect the design when finished.

AI: That sounds like such a unique and personal form of art! I love that you're creating something so customized for each person.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I reach to AI quite frequently throughout the process. Sometimes I use it to help me write emails if I am feeling overwhelmed or nervous about certain customers. I use it to help me come up with ideas for what to put where on my shoe designs. I also use it to discuss color combinations and how they would look on certain parts of the shoe. If I'm facing serious artist's block, I'll have it make some designs for me to gain inspiration from. I NEVER copy these designs - they are used strictly to inspire unique ideas for myself. I also ask it for recommendations on different types of paints and sealer, if I'm wanting to switch my materials up a bit.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into different stages of your work, from the business side with emails all the way through to materials advice.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: [REDACTED] Yeah! I recently did a commissioned pair of Attack on Titan shoes. When I started out, I wasn't really sure how I wanted to represent the characters on the shoes. Positioning is super important; the shape of the shoe can really distort characters, if they're not placed right. To help me, I had the model make a few different shoe layouts for me, each with the characters facing certain directions. I was able to find a position that fit very nicely on the shoe. I also had it help me figure out which color would be best for the background. It was incredibly helpful to have the support - it made the project run so much smoother, which was really needed at the time. I was lined up with 11 different commissions, so it made all the difference. I'll attach a picture of how the shoes turned out! The picture honestly makes them look a little weird, but I promise they look pretty perfect in person, haha.

AI: Wow, those shoes look incredible! The character positioning really does work perfectly with the shape of the shoe - you can see how much thought went into that placement. And that gradient background is striking.

When you're working with AI like you did on this project - getting layout suggestions and color advice - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The collaboration was great, but there were a few frustrations. I can't blame AI for not being able to produce a perfect shoe with a perfect design idea, you know? It did take a few tries before we could elaborate on design ideas that I liked. Fine-tuning was frustrating. When it came to the non-visual collaboration, everything was very smooth and easy. I definitely felt as if the give and take was equal at some points. When I felt like my creative juices just weren't flowing, the model gave me some creative ideas that really pulled me out of it. For the most part, I was the driving creative force, and the AI model was just the icing on the cake to help ensure I captured everything perfectly.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - you as the driving creative force and AI as the ""icing on the cake."" It sounds like you've found a balance where you maintain creative ownership while using AI as a creative partner when you need that extra push.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I feel as if my creative playing field has been substantially increased. Before, I definitely felt limited to what I could conjure up in my mind. Now, I am able to get ideas and inspiration from the suggestions AI gives me. I am able to think of things that I never would have on my own. So I would say that my motivation, attention to detail, and ability to create are all aspects of my creative work that have improved since using AI.

AI: That expansion of your creative playing field sounds really empowering - going from being limited by what you could conjure up on your own to having this broader landscape of possibilities to explore.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have a LOT of concerns. The more AI learns, the better it becomes at mimicking humanity and human creations. I worry that true artists, like myself, will be entirely replaced by what is easily replicated by AI. I am so worried that true human expression will be outplayed by limitless AI ability.

AI: That's such an honest and deeply felt concern - the fear that the very thing that's helping expand your creative possibilities could eventually replace the human expression that makes your work uniquely yours.

Tell me more about what you mean by ""true human expression"" - what is it about your work that you feel AI can't replicate?

User: It can't replicate the strokes of paint that I put on the shoes. It can't replicate the earnest feeling that is dug into every pen stroke on a drawing that I pour my heart into. It can't replicate the smell of the paint as it dries, or the hours of effort and planning that go into each and every shoe or drawing. It's so frightening that something that took me almost 20 hours can be created in a matter of seconds with AI.

AI: The way you describe those physical, sensory, and emotional elements - the actual paint strokes, the heart poured into each pen stroke, even the smell of drying paint - those are such profound aspects of the creative process that go far beyond just the final visual result.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll continue using it as that ""icing on the cake,"" or do you see the relationship changing?

User: I do think that I will continue to use it as my icing. It is truly helpful. However, if I hear word from the artist community that we need to make an effort to stop AI use, I'll happily comply. I don't want to be a part of something that ultimately reduces the value of human creativity.

AI: That willingness to step away from something that's genuinely helpful to you if it threatens the broader creative community really speaks to your values as an artist and your commitment to preserving human creativity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how you described that tension between AI expanding your creative playing field while simultaneously worrying about it potentially replacing the deeply human elements of your work - those paint strokes, that earnest feeling, the hours of effort that can't be replicated.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between using AI as a creative tool while preserving the irreplaceable human elements of your artistry will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Best of luck with your upcoming commissions, and thank you for creating such beautiful, personalized art for your customers!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.  No questions, I'm just ready to get started!

AI: Perfect! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer! I'm in the process of working on my debut novel right now, so I'm deep in the trenches of writing and editing my manuscript. Therefore, I have to come up with things like a title, characters, plot, etc.

AI: That's exciting - congratulations on working on your debut novel! That's such a significant milestone.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I don't allow myself to use AI for the creative meat and potatoes of my story, because I want it to be authentic to me. However, I do find myself looking for help for titles in my work by giving AI a synopsis of my story. I also tend to go to it to come up with names that sound good for siblings, last name ideas, things like that which aren't as crucial to the creative part of my work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making between the ""creative meat and potatoes"" and those supporting elements. 

Can you describe a specific recent example where you used AI for one of these tasks? What was that experience like - how did you approach it and what happened?

User: I was really struggling with a title for my book. I had everything else, my story was well rounded, but nothing was sticking out within my work that would make the perfect, catchy title. I used AI to brainstorm, which then got my creative juices flowing, and I bounced back and forth with it until we found a perfect title.

AI: That's fascinating - you describe it as bouncing back and forth until ""we"" found the perfect title. 

Tell me more about that collaborative process. What did that back-and-forth look like, and how did you know when you'd landed on the right one?

User: So, I started by basically saying, ""here's the plot of my story, here's something significant that happens in it, here are the main characters' namds

AI: I can hear you were starting to explain the process - it sounds like you gave the AI some key story elements to work with. Please go ahead and finish that thought - I'd love to hear more about how that conversation unfolded.

User: Sorry, hit send on accident! Let me start over. So, I started by basically saying, ""here's the plot of my story, here's something significant that happens in it, here are the main characters' names, can you help?"" AI then gave me some ideas, none of which sounded right. However, they did point out something minor from my story I mentioned, which gave me an idea. It was a play on a classic phrase that most people would probably know, but not all. I asked for advice on if it was clear what I was playing off of, and if AI thought people would get it. AI said they likely would, and gave me some similar ideas. One of the ideas it gave was almost perfect, so I changed one word and got a title I love.

AI: That's such an interesting process - it sounds like the AI helped you see your own story from a different angle by highlighting something you'd mentioned but maybe hadn't fully considered as title material.

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions? How does that feel to you as the writer?

User: Personally, I feel like the way I use it still allows me to drive the creative decisions. I'm mostly using it as a way to force myself to look at things from a different angle. As a writer, or a creative person in general, it's really important to me to stay in control of the creative decisions and use AI solely to see my work in a different way, kind of like if I was bouncing ideas off of another writer over coffee.

AI: I love that analogy - like bouncing ideas off another writer over coffee. That really captures something important about how you're approaching this collaboration.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: I think that I spend less time stressing over minor things and more time actually writing and being creative when I don't have to do the ""parts"" that don't come as naturally to me, like coming up with a title or making sure names fit together. I have a tendency to get stuck on certain elements like that, and I lose focus and motivation. Now, they're more streamlined and less of a pain point for me.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI has helped you move past some of those creative blocks that used to derail your momentum.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of writing?

User: I do fear that AI could take over writing. I know that may not happen soon, as using AI, I know it currently isn't quite as capable of producing what a naturally talented writer could. In other words, I know the difference between an AI story and a human's work they've poured their heart into almost immediately. There are markers that give it away, you know? But, I also know AI gets smarter every day, so it's not unlikely. I think for a while, there will be some push back from the audience at least that wants something from real live authors as opposed to AI, so that gives me some hope. I like to think AI can just continue to find new ways to help us without being the driving force in someone's creative process, but only time will tell.

AI: You raise such thoughtful points about the tension between AI's evolving capabilities and that human authenticity that readers seem to value. It sounds like you're cautiously optimistic about finding that balance.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll expand how you use it, or do you see yourself sticking to these boundaries you've established?

User: I think, for my given occupation, it'll stay about the same. I think AI will continue to grow and get smarter as we continue to train it, so maybe I'll end up with things like strong titles without a lot of back and forth that starts with some more cheesy ideas. However, like I said, I wish to remain the creative powerhouse of the situation, so I'm not sure I'd ever just blindly take something AI created and slap it on my work as my own. I'd want to keep using it as a tool to get my creative juices flowing, not letting it create for me. Who knows, maybe there will be even more ways in the next couple years that it can assist me without giving up my creative edge, which will allow me to expand on how I use it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared, and you've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that boundary between using AI as a creative catalyst versus letting it drive the creative decisions - that coffee shop collaborator analogy really stuck with me.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's about all I have!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authenticity while using AI as a strategic tool - especially for those elements that used to create blocks in your workflow - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Best of luck with your debut novel! It sounds like you've found a really thoughtful approach to integrating AI that supports rather than replaces your creative vision."
creativity_0031,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I am ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a video producer. I don't have very ""typical"" projects. Right now I am working on a video for a hypnotist and a short animated film about God and His many forms. Earlier this year, I shot an  independent feature film about 4 Generations of black women with sleep disorders and psychic powers. In the past, I was mostly focused on making television and podcasts about technology.

AI: That's a fascinating range of projects - from hypnotist videos to animated films about spirituality to features about generational stories. It sounds like you work across very different genres and formats.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: It completely depends on the project - the videos for the hypnotist mix short shots of AI-generated images and video in with traditional graphics and editing. The short about God is all AI-generated video edited together with traditional non-linear editing. The feature film did not use AI, but I am going back now to see it I can stitch together some stills we shot with footage we took by using AI, without it looking like I'm using AI.

AI: That's really interesting how you're tailoring your AI use to each project's specific needs. You mentioned trying to use AI to stitch together stills and footage for the feature film ""without it looking like I'm using AI.""

Tell me more about that - what does it mean to you when AI integration is invisible versus when it's more apparent in the final work?

User: The first two projects I mentioned are animated, so it is either easy to blend the AI-generated animation in with the rest of the video, or, in the case if the religious piece, it all looks AI generated, which is fine. But the feature film is all real people, in real environments, so  anything AI-generated has to look real - characters have to be consistent, people can't have 6 fingers, etc.

AI: Ah, I see - so it's about matching the visual language and expectations of each project. The animated pieces give you more creative freedom with AI elements, while the live-action feature demands that AI contributions are seamlessly realistic.

Can you describe a specific moment or scene from one of these projects where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that experience feel for you as the creator?

User: Right now, I  am trying to make transitions from some photos we took that I photoshopped to look like they are old black and white pictures to color footage of the same moment. Unfortunately, the photos and footage don't line up perfectly, and one is a different shot entirely, so trying to get a smooth transition has been very interesting, but also frustrating. I haven't gotten a result I like yet.

AI: That sounds like a challenging puzzle - trying to bridge between those different visual elements while maintaining the story flow. The frustration you're describing is really telling.

When you're working through that process of not getting the result you want yet, how would you describe the back-and-forth with the AI tools? Are you feeling like you're directing the process, or does it feel more like negotiating with something that has its own ideas?

User: DEFINITELY the latter.  I have gotten close a couple of times - I just had to tweak an angle, or two actors in a scene looked perfect, but another was off, but trying to make that one fix will set off a whole slew of other problems. I will get there (i think), but it feels liker I'm going to have to just run a hundred variations of the same thing before I get one perfect generation, completely at random.

AI: That's a really vivid description - the idea that you might get the perfect result completely at random after a hundred tries, and that fixing one element creates a cascade of new problems. 

When you do finally get that result you're looking for, how do you think you'll feel about it? Will it feel like your creative achievement, or something else?

User: I don't care what anybody says about working with AI not being ""real"" art - when I get a good result, I  am very happy. I have almost always created as part of a team, where i was writing something for someone else to read, or giving stuff I shot to someone else to edit it. Working with AI feels like that - like we are a team working together to make something special that we couldn't make separately.

AI: That's such a compelling perspective - thinking of it as team collaboration rather than something that diminishes your creative contribution. It sounds like your background working in collaborative environments really shapes how you approach AI.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Are there things you find yourself doing differently now in how you approach projects or solve creative problems?

User: I spend a lot of time learning  - or figuring out - how to use different tools to accomplish what I want. I also spend a lot of time trying to make tools do something that they are not good at - wrong tool, or not advanced enough, or just something I can't figure out how to get working the way I want it to work. So I guess the aspect  of my creative work that has changed the most is that I can do more things, but figuring out which things I can and cannot do and how to do the things  I can takes a lot of time.

AI: That's a really honest assessment - this tension between expanded possibilities and the time investment required to navigate what's actually achievable. It sounds like there's a whole new layer of technical exploration that's become part of your creative process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Same as everyone's I guess - that as companies figure out how to use these tools, they will need less people to do the creative work. There will still be some jobs for people who are really good at it, but fewer and fewer. It's notr really any different than the past couple decades  ahve been though - My first job was working on a TV show with a staff of 60 people. A decade later, I was on a team of about 12 people doing the same thing. A decade after that, 5-10 people were all the people we needed to make 5 separate shows a week.

AI: That's a really insightful historical perspective - you're seeing AI as the latest wave in a long pattern of technological efficiency rather than something entirely unprecedented. The numbers you're describing are pretty stark - from 60 people to potentially even fewer with AI tools.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your relationship with these tools will change as they improve?

User: Yes. I am pretty solid on image generation now, whenever I can get past preconcieved notions of what I think an image should look like and accept what I am given. Video isn't quite the same...yet.  I feel like video has just gotten to the point where it is possible to get a good shot using my computer instead of an outside company's server farm.  But now that it has hit that point, I just need to figure out how to make the tools i have do something close to what AI want them to. It took me a couple of months of generating with Stable Diffusion before I got any still images I could stand looking at. The video side is coming along faster than that, at least.

AI: That progression you're describing is fascinating - from those early months with Stable Diffusion where nothing looked right, to now feeling solid with image generation, and seeing video starting to follow a similar but faster trajectory.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI collaboration feeling like teamwork rather than something that diminishes creativity, and your historical view of how technology has continuously changed team sizes and workflows in your field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: It takes 20% of the work to get 80% of the way to your goal, but then 80% of your work to get the last 20%. I feel like Generative AI is at  80% of where it needs to be, or nearly there. Getting the last 20% will be much harder.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - and it perfectly captures what you were describing earlier about getting close with those transitions but then struggling to nail down those final details that would make it seamless.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI work, the evolution of team sizes in creative industries, and especially that 80/20 observation about where the technology currently sits will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the possibilities and the frustrations.

User: Thanks, this has been fun!

AI: I'm so glad you enjoyed it! It was really enlightening to hear about your work across such diverse projects and how you're navigating this evolving landscape of AI tools. Your perspective as someone who's been through multiple waves of technological change in the industry was particularly valuable.

Thanks again for sharing your time and insights with us - it will definitely help inform our understanding of how AI is fitting into creative workflows. Best of luck with those transitions you're working on!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's start with your first question.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write short fiction stories. The genre varies; Sci-Fi and Fantasy are favorites of mine, but I write in other genres too. It starts with brainstorming, and when I find an interesting idea or concept to try I start researching the topics that might be relevant. I plan an overall arc for the story to follow with some specific events or scenes to keep my later drafts organized. I typically make edits on the fly, but usually make several edits/refinements throughout the process. Once I think I'm happy with how the project is turning out I'll usually take some time away from it before returning to see if I'm still happy with it. Afterwards I upload the story to an appropriate public site if I'm just writing it for fun, or send it to the person who commissioned it in that case.

AI: That's a really detailed process - I can see how you've developed a structured approach from concept to publication. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I do try to limit my use of AI, so it's my voice and writing style and not someone else's. Sometimes I use AI while editing, to make sure what I've written makes sense and flows in a coherent manner, as well as double-check my grammar and spelling. I also sometimes use it for brainstorming, a change in perspective can really help to come up with interesting ideas. I prefer to do my own research for now, however, sometimes Google's AI Overview has links to pages that are useful, but I usually disregard the actual content of that overview and just check the cited webpages instead.

AI: That's interesting - you're being very intentional about maintaining your own voice while selectively using AI for specific functions. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I recently was writing in Microsoft Word, which has integrated AI. It automatically highlights what has been written and prepares suggestions. In the case of grammar or spelling mistakes it is very useful, but sometimes it prepares suggestions that go beyond that. In this particular case it suggested I change some words to make the sentence easier to read when I had written it to emphasize a specific word in that sentence. The suggestion was technically right, it would be easier to read if I followed its advice, but it would have also defeated the whole point of writing the sentence to begin with. I didn't want to see anymore AI suggestions for the rest of the day because I kept thinking that if everyone used these kinds of suggestions to ""improve"" their writing, everyone's style would be the same. No one would have a unique writing style anymore. I suppose the experience made me feel conflicted. AI can be very useful for small corrections, but when it is forced into software it's invasive, encouraging over-reliance on the model's functions.

AI: That's a really powerful example - the tension between technical correctness and creative intent. It sounds like that moment crystallized some concerns for you about how AI integration can push writers toward homogenization.

When you do choose to work with AI - like during your deliberate brainstorming sessions - how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The answer to that question varies. Sometimes I have a specific idea I want to explore, and sometimes even a planned method for that exploration, in which case I'm driving the creative decisions. Sometimes I let the model decide the direction the conversation goes for awhile. In these cases I don't ever take the ideas suggested, but let them act as a guide to slingshot my mind to an adjacent idea. I think the different perspective provided really helps with that. I think the collaboration during these brainstorming sessions works as well as it does because I get to decide how much control I have at any one time.

AI: That's fascinating - you've found a way to use AI as a creative catalyst while maintaining control over when and how much influence it has. The idea of using AI suggestions as a ""slingshot"" to adjacent ideas is really compelling.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The brainstorming sessions I think have changed the most. If I was totally blocked I'd stop and do something else to wait for inspiration to strike. I didn't get as much work done when that happened. Now, when I can't find something interesting to write, I can use AI to help a bit. Sometimes it can help me with exploring settings for stories, or come up with ways to challenge my own perspectives, which usually leads to me thinking about how I can explore that change in perspective through the stories I write. Even if nothing comes of it, I still feel like I was a little more productive than I would have been otherwise.

AI: It sounds like AI has really helped you work through those creative blocks that used to mean stopping entirely. That shift from waiting for inspiration to having a tool that can help generate it seems quite significant.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: The homogenization of writing style that was mentioned earlier. Everyone wants to express themselves, and AI does makes those small suggestions that add up, until everything that's written sounds the same. This might make it hard for someone who is trying to use their voice to express themselves to be able to find their audience, or for their audience to stumble onto their work. If AI is invasive in the software we use to write it becomes even harder to not use it, to resist thinking ""maybe it knows better than me."" That makes me ask the question ""when will it be more worthwhile for AI to write for me, instead of writing myself?""

AI: That's a profound concern - the gradual erosion from ""AI helping me write"" to ""AI writing for me."" The way you described that internal dialogue of ""maybe it knows better than me"" really captures how these small suggestions can undermine creative confidence over time.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: If I'm optimistic, I see AI being more useful in helping with research; providing more accurate responses and even being able to accurately delve into more obscure topics. This could really condense the time it takes for me to actually start writing about a topic. I am, unfortunately, not a very optimistic person. I expect AI to continue down the path it's already heading, being invasive and furthering the homogenization of writing and other arts. It will be better and better at writing or generating images, and people will find it too much to resist over-relying on AI to do things for them, instead of helping them do it better themselves.

AI: Your distinction between AI helping you do things better versus doing things for you really cuts to the heart of the matter. It sounds like you see a critical difference between AI as a research tool versus AI as a creative substitute.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control and that powerful example about the Word suggestion that would have undermined your intentional emphasis.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Thank you for asking these questions and hearing me out.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI as a creative catalyst while protecting your authentic voice, and your concerns about the subtle but cumulative effects of AI suggestions on creative individuality, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your workflow while remaining mindful of its potential pitfalls. Your perspective as someone actively navigating these challenges is invaluable.

Thanks again for participating in this research!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do quite a lot of creative work with AI. I do many crafting projects, design social media posts, peruse AI for inspiration for crochet projects and patterns, come up with fun ideas to boost morale at my place of work, etc. Recently, I used AI to design a bubble gum machine logo for my office. It gives out adult prizes. AI helped me come up with a vinyl design that reads: [REDACTED]'s Subpar Prize Machine: Lower your expectations and turn the knob. It has a melty smiley face on it. The staff members love it! I also have used AI recently to come up with many social media posts and inspiration for the dental office I work at.

AI: That sounds like such a fun and diverse range of creative projects! I love the humor in that bubble gum machine logo - ""Lower your expectations and turn the knob"" is brilliant.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I ultimately begin with AI to expand on an idea that I have. Let's talk about the bubble gum machine to start. I first saw an old bubble gum machine for sale and thought it would be awesome for staff members to be able to earn tokens to get a spin. When I got my initial idea, I then turned to AI to first get recommendations on fun trinkets to put in that were fun and adult humor. Then I asked it to generate some fun names to call it based on some factors: my office is in the basement, it hands out subpar gifts, it is my own personal machine and not sanctioned by the doctors, etc. After inputting my initial ideas, I was able to conversate back and forth until I settled on the perfect name. After settling on a name, I continued to consult it to come up with a fun slogan so staff members would know not to expect anything super great from the machine, as it is truly just a fun little game to boost morale. After I decided on a fun slogan, I was able to consult it to come up with a design for a vinyl cut out to put on the front of the machine.

AI: That's such a detailed process - I can really see how you use AI as a creative partner throughout each stage! It sounds like you start with your own spark of an idea and then use AI to help you develop and refine it step by step.

Can you describe what that back-and-forth conversation with AI felt like as you were working through the bubble gum machine project? How did you know when you'd landed on ""the perfect name""?

User: I initially stated what I was doing with the project and gave the details I mentioned to you earlier. AI then gave some suggestions and I went back and forth multiple times, over multiple days even, to finally come up with a name I thought was perfect. AI suggested many names to begin with and I would prompt back stating to focus more on one thought process (ex: add more suggestions that have to do with my office being in the basement, give me more suggestions that get the point across that these prizes are basically worthless, give me a suggestion that uses my name, make it shorter because it needs to fit on a 5"" x 17"" glass front and I want the words readable, etc.). After spending quite a few turns (probably 10 over a few days), the model suggested a name I thought embodied the project very well--[REDACTED]'s Subpar Prize Machine. I then wanted to add a little subtext so went back to the model to gain ideas for wording. Again, I needed it to be a short length so it would fit well on the space I needed. After the same back and forth process I mentioned above, I settled on Lower your expectations and turn the knob. I run the ideas by a few friends and they all agreed it was a great name.

AI: That's fascinating - so it wasn't just one quick exchange, but really an iterative creative dialogue over several days. It sounds like you were very much steering the direction, giving AI specific constraints and feedback to guide it toward what you were envisioning.

When you're working with AI in this back-and-forth way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Honestly, I have been reluctant to use AI much because I'm afraid of neglecting my own brain of the exercise it gets by brainstorming, writing, editing, etc. So, I always like to make sure I am giving the initial idea and use AI to hone that. I would hate to live in a world where humans don't have original ideas and everything is just AI generated. This is kind of a guardrail I have set for myself. I usually get my ideas from different types of media (mostly things I see on socials) and then try to expand that so it has a spin that is all my own. At that point, I will sometimes take it to AI to expand on that. It is rare that I use AI to come up with an original idea before first brainstorming the situation on my own. It makes me feel like a bit of a failure if I can't come up with my own thoughts to get started. It's a fine line between using my resources (AI) and still using my own brain so it doesn't waste away.

AI: That's such a thoughtful perspective - you've clearly given a lot of consideration to maintaining that balance. It sounds like you see AI as a powerful resource but want to make sure you're still exercising your own creative muscles and maintaining ownership over the initial spark.

Tell me more about that feeling you mentioned - the concern about your brain ""wasting away"" if you rely too heavily on AI. What does that look like for you day-to-day?

User: Many times, especially when coming up with social media post ideas, I think it would be so easy to just pop a simple prompt into AI and let it do its thing. I have to exercise those restraints that I have put in place for myself so that I continue to use my own thought process. Sometimes I feel it would be easier to just start with AI, and I might actually do that on a day where I have zero time or am in a crunch. However, I always feel a little like a cheater and unoriginal when I do that. My work is my personality in a way and if I am posting something or coming up with a creative idea for work, I want to be able to say that it's mine and not just an AI prompt generation. Keeping in touch with me as a person helps me maintain those guardrails when using AI. This is also true of writing. I have to do some business writing and have always prided myself on being a good writer. I feel those skills are going downhill due to the ease of just plugging in a prompt and having a letter done at my convenience. I don't feel I can actually take credit for it, which actually dampers my self confidence a bit.

AI: That's really honest and insightful - there's clearly a tension between the convenience AI offers and wanting to maintain your sense of creative ownership and skill development. It sounds like when you do use AI as a starting point, it leaves you feeling less connected to the final result.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Both in terms of the work itself and how you feel about your creative process?

User: I would say that it just comes around to being a bit of a faster process, especially with social media posts. I have so much information right at my fingertips and don't have to dig around to come up with ideas as I have in the past. And even though it's more convenient, I feel it still takes away from my own creative process in some ways. However, I am usually pleased with the ideas that are recommended that maybe I wouldn't have thought of on my own. However, it's' still a sticky situation because I always feel like I can't really take full credit for those ideas. It feels much better to show my boss a post and say that I came up with it from my own brain rather than using AI and then showing the boss and having to admit that it didn't come from my own brain but AI instead. Overall, even though I have tried not to let the addition of AI take away some of my creative process, it has definitely had an impact on it still. Again, its the same idea where I feel less proud of projects when AI is involved.

AI: That sense of pride in your work really comes through - it sounds like there's something fundamentally different about how you feel when you can say ""I came up with this"" versus when AI played a role, even if the final result is good.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Broadly speaking, I fear we are entering an era where humans have no original ideas. If we don't work to continue the brainstorming process in our own minds, it is a skill that will ultimately be left behind for humanity. I already see this in younger people who have basically known AI their entire lives. And surely there is a limit to AI, meaning the world might become a very boring place with limited ideas. Will all media start to look the same? Also, will we enter a time where we can't believe anything we see is real and must assume it is AI generated? Ultimately, it may be true that my job will no longer exist, as social media will just be managed solely by AI. That seems rather damaging.

AI: Those are some profound concerns - the idea that we might lose fundamental human skills like brainstorming, and that creativity itself could become homogenized. The point about younger people who've grown up with AI is particularly striking.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll maintain those same guardrails, or might your approach change?

User: I desperately want to keep those guardrails, but it is human design to give in to easier ways. I do fear I will rely on it more and more, even though the intent exists to avoid this. I will say that working behind the scenes being an AI trainer has given me a bit of a better perspective of AI since humans are behind the scenes of the training. However, I even see this being taken over and replaced with other AI models in the future, as this is already beginning on some of the projects I work on. My ultimate goal would be to continue the creative process as I am now. However, that's just not reality and things will always be evolving. I expect that I will eventually lean toward the human condition of conforming to the AI world and relying on it more and more. My hope is that AI developers will seek ways to make the process of relying on human input and feedback with models so that human creativity is not lost forever.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective on the tension between convenience and maintaining creative ownership - that internal struggle you described about feeling like ""a cheater"" when using AI as a starting point really illuminates something important about how creative professionals are navigating this new landscape.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authenticity while navigating the practical benefits of AI, and your concerns about preserving human creativity for future generations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about the internal conflicts many creative professionals are likely facing - that balance between efficiency and ownership is clearly something worth understanding better as we think about AI's role in creative work.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!"
creativity_0034,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a science fiction novelist. Most of my series have involved time travel, but the current one is a bit of a departure. It's a four-book series set in the late 21st century, and partially takes place on a Mars that is in the final stages of terraforming. My academic background is more historical and political than scientific, so I frequently have biology questions, and sometimes need to know things like how far it is from one geographic point on Mars to another.

AI: That sounds fascinating - a terraforming Mars setting must require a lot of world-building research. I can imagine those biology and geography questions come up quite a bit when you're trying to make that world feel authentic.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Any time I have a question that requires me to use advanced math. :)  I've also used AI to help come up with some basic rules for a language. Occasionally, I use AI as an advanced thesaurus when I can't come up with the right word.  Or when I need to figure out how much a knish might cost at a food truck in 2090 given typical rates of inflation. Stuff like that.

AI: Those are some really practical and specific uses! I love the knish pricing example - that's such a concrete detail that probably helps make your future world feel real and lived-in.

Can you describe a specific recent project or moment where you used AI? What role did it play in that instance, and how did that feel for you as a writer?

User: I needed to figure out whether the process of growing lab meat and the quality of the final product would be affected by the lower gravity on Mars.

AI: That's such a specific and technical question! Tell me more about that - how did you approach getting that answer, and what was it like working through that problem with AI?

User: I simply asked what the differences might be and was then given a list of changes. One of my beta readers is a biologist, and I usually run these things past her, but she was away from the computer. When I spoke with her later, she said that the response was well-reasoned and lower gravity would probably have many of those effects. I like being able to get a general idea on topics like this before I run them past beta readers and other specialists I know, because it saves them time I have my ducks in a row before I contact them. I was less happy with some of the creative suggests for a generic name for lab meat, but I can usually come up with those on my own.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a kind of first-pass research tool to get oriented before you consult your human experts. That seems like a smart workflow.

When you're working with AI in these situations, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions in your writing process?

User: Oh, I'm definitely in the driver's seat. It wouldn't work for me if I ever felt that AI was anything other than a productivity tool. My writing style is commonly known as ""pantser"" as in ""flying by the seat of your pants."" If things are mapped out too carefully, I lose interest in writing that story. Why finish it if you already know everything about how the story ends? :)  So, I wouldn't be including to use AI for plotting or outlining -- I don't do much of that. And it's worked for 27 books, so I'm not going to tamper with it.

AI: That's a great insight - it sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI handles the technical research questions that support your world-building, but stays completely out of the creative storytelling process that drives your passion for writing.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has it shifted how you approach certain parts of your process?

User: One odd thing that I've done from time to time is to write a scene in first person present (which is my strength), then let AI shift it over to 3rd person past. This is the first series that I've written in that tense and POV. It doesn't come easily to me, but this is a slightly different genre than I've written in before, and first person present isn't the norm. I won't make this mistake again, but I've got to finish this last book before I can get back to what I like best. Writing in a way that flows for me and then having AI take the first pass at shifting it to the other style actually saves me a good bit of time because I stay in the flow.

AI: That's such a clever workaround! It sounds like you found a way to let AI handle the mechanical translation between tenses and POVs while you stay in your creative flow state. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: I've got a lot of concerns.  I used to be traditionally published, but royalties dropped and they were no longer worth the tradeoff against the creative control that I retain by self-publishing. Unfortunately, its really easy to self-publish--and a book doesn't have to be good to earn money. There are people out there using AI to crank out massive numbers of derivative books each year using systems that were trained on many books, including my own. They can produce hundreds, maybe even thousands, of bad knockoffs in the time that it takes me to write a single book. Even if the quality is low, there are ways to game the system so that you make decent money on Amazon -- and that screws up the algorithm, resulting in lower royalties for many authors who are producing high quality, original work. I love the idea of AI as a research and editing assistant -- it helps me to get more of my books to my base of readers by reducing the time I spend on those tasks. But it's a very slippery slope, and writers (including me) are worried that flooding the market with derivative AI content is going to make it harder to earn a living and much, much harder for the next generation of creatives to break through.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you're experiencing both the benefits of AI as a productivity tool and the very real concerns about market saturation and economic impact. It sounds like there's a meaningful distinction for you between using AI to enhance your own creative process versus using it to generate content wholesale.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your current approach will change?

User: For me, AI is a useful tool to handle tasks that I'd either do myself or else have to pay for another round of editing/proofreading. I write in the middle of the night, so having AI to answer a question that is stumping me is far better than waiting a week for someone to get back to me. It's possible that I'll find a few other tasks where AI works for me, but overall, I think it will remain largely the same.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've maintained creative control while using AI strategically for research and technical tasks, and your nuanced view of both the benefits and the serious market concerns facing writers today.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that about covers it. Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research assistant while maintaining complete creative control, and your concerns about the broader market impacts, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the practical benefits you've found and the genuine challenges facing writers today. Best of luck finishing up that final book in your Mars series!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do visual arts in a variety of mediums. An example project may be an acrylic painting, that I may than scan to make prints out of.

AI: That's great - I love the combination of traditional and digital elements in your process. The transition from physical painting to digital prints is really interesting.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I like using AI to brainstorm and when I am stuck. I might use it to help generate a list of ideas when I have a creative block, or to help expand an idea. For instance, if I know I want to paint something using paynes grey with a red accent that has an autumn theme, I might ask AI for a list of possible subject matter or ideas for paintings.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to use AI as a creative partner for ideation. I can see how having that brainstorming support would be valuable when you hit those creative blocks.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: An example of when I used AI was when I wanted to paint a series of woodland themed small paintings. I planned to paint a mushroom in one, a fern in another, and then I asked AI for a list of other ideas to help me come up with other subjects to expand the series on theme. It helped me decide to also paint a fallen tree and wild berries.

AI: That's a wonderful example - it sounds like AI helped you expand and round out your woodland series in a really organic way. The mushroom, fern, fallen tree, and wild berries create such a cohesive collection.

When you're working with AI in situations like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am driving the creative decisions. I find I need to carefully craft the prompts and feed the AI creativity to get helpful feedback and responses.

AI: That's really insightful - the idea that you need to ""feed the AI creativity"" to get useful responses back. It sounds like there's a real skill to crafting those prompts effectively.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'm not sure if anything has changed. Sometimes AI is able to help, othertimes it is not helpful. Now, when I feel blocked or frustrated, I have an additional tool (AI) to try to use to see if it unblocks my creative flow.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - having AI as one more tool in your toolkit when you need it, rather than it fundamentally changing how you work. It sounds like it's become part of your problem-solving arsenal.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm not a fan of people using AI to generate images or replace artists in fields. I worry humans will loose artistic talents or appreciation for human made art.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - using AI as a brainstorming tool versus using it to generate the actual artwork. Your concern about losing human artistic talents and appreciation for handmade work really resonates.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I hope it will be more helpful and insightful, and able to help me grow as an artist. I would like it to be able to critique my work in a constructive way to help me grow was an artist by providing useful tips about how to practically improve my work.

AI: That's such an interesting vision - AI as a constructive critic and mentor to help you develop your artistic skills. The idea of getting practical, actionable feedback to improve your technique sounds really valuable.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're the one driving the creative decisions and need to ""feed the AI creativity"" - that really captures something important about how this collaboration works.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that covers it all, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming partner while maintaining your role as the creative decision-maker, along with your thoughtful distinction between AI as a tool versus AI as a replacement for human creativity, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and your concerns. Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your woodland series and future projects!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds, great. I don't have any questions at the moment.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure. I'm an illustrator and graphic designer. My projects can range from working on logos for small businesses to creating  illustrations, infographics, and more for online courses.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of work! I can imagine each type of project has its own unique demands.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: AI is useful for when I'm trying to craft pitches to prospective clients, respond to client emails, or when I want to know what a contract or TOS says.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're primarily using AI for the business and communication side of your work rather than the actual creative design process itself. 

Tell me more about that. When you're working on the visual aspects - the logos, illustrations, or infographics themselves - do you find yourself using AI tools there as well, or do you keep those parts of your workflow separate?

User: I don't use Generative AI in my creative work. If I'm feeling really stuck and uninspired, I might use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. But ultimately, I try to avoid AI use in my workflow as I don't want to become dependent on it. Creativity is a muscle and if I don't exercise it, it will wither!

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the idea of creativity as a muscle that needs to be exercised. I can hear that maintaining your own creative independence is important to you.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I've been wanting to branch out and create stock patterns and graphics to sell online. I generally design in my own aesthetic/style,  but I know that I'd sell more graphics if I created them in a larger range of styles and appeal to more niches. So I asked for a list of styles and niches. I probably could have done my own research, but it was way faster to just get the list using AI. Once I got the list, I picked a few niches that seemed promising.

AI: That's a great example of using AI as a research tool to expand your business opportunities. It sounds like it saved you time on the market research side while still leaving all the creative decisions and actual design work in your hands.

How did that feel for you - using AI in that more strategic, business-focused way compared to keeping it out of the actual design process?

User: I mean, it was definitely a timesaver and time is money. That said, using AI as an assist, rather than letting it do the actual core, creative work, allows me to maintain my integrity as a creative.

AI: I really appreciate that distinction you're making between AI as an ""assist"" versus doing the core creative work. That seems to be a key boundary for you.

When you think about maintaining your integrity as a creative, what does that mean to you? What would cross the line from assistance into something that would compromise that integrity?

User: I think using AI tools to do all of the work is too much. Again, I don't use generative AI in my work, because at that point, what is the point of me as a creative? And what is the work without the artist? Simply entering in a prompt to generate an image that is ultimately simply an average of images scraped off the web is not creative. The end result lacks substance.

AI: That's a powerful way to put it - ""what is the work without the artist?"" It sounds like for you, the human creative process and intentionality behind the work is what gives it substance and meaning.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI, even in those limited ways you've described?

User: Having AI assist with the tedious things like emails, contracts, pitches, etc has saved me time that I can put towards working on creative projects and improving my skills.

AI: That's a really valuable benefit - freeing up time for the work that truly matters to you. It sounds like AI has become a way to handle the administrative burden so you can focus more energy on developing your craft.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Many creatives, including myself, are concerned about the hype surrounding AI tools and how it affects our job stability. Creative work is often undervalued in our society. When budget cuts need to be made, it's often the arts that take a hit. In corporate environments (which is where I work), management is often not aware (or chooses to ignore) the value that the creative team brings to each project. There's a lot of discussion online about how decision makers in many companies are reducing headcount because they are letting AI handle the tasks that humans previously did. The creative industry isn't immune to this trend. Stores like Michael's are selling seasonal ""art"" prints that are made with AI, Anthropolgie's 2024 holiday shopping bags featured AI art--these are instances where, likely for the sake of profits, companies are choosing to use AI, rather than hire an artist. If companies continue to do this, it will have a devastating effect on creatives' livelihoods.

AI: You've articulated something really important there - the broader economic and industry dynamics at play, not just the technology itself. It sounds like your concerns go beyond the tools themselves to how decision-makers are choosing to implement them, often without fully understanding or valuing what human creatives bring to the table.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll maintain these same boundaries, or do you anticipate your approach might shift?

User: I will likely continue to use AI to help me with mundane admin tasks and to help me understand the legalese that contracts and TOS are swamped with. I know that some photo editing tools utilize AI to improve a photo's lighting, colors, etc. I am okay with that. But I will never use GenAI to do my work, because again, why even be an illustrator if do that? I might as well quit.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your clear articulation of the boundary between AI as an administrative assistant versus AI doing the core creative work, and your perspective on how the creative industry's undervaluation makes these changes particularly concerning for professionals like yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative integrity while finding practical uses for AI, and your concerns about the broader industry implications, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've considered these boundaries and the bigger picture impact on your field. Take care!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I have two types of creative work. The first is creating images for adult coloring pages. They are more intricate than a child's coloring page with more detail. For instance, a realistic dragon sleeping in a forest surrounded by trees, fairies, crystals, and hidden images amongst the leaves. So, a project would be taking a creative scene in my head and turning it into an image of black and white lines with no shading. The second is writing creative passages for use in social media. They are short passages but very specific in their theme and tone. A project would entail focusing in on a message that I want to convey and wording it most efficiently without losing the tone. I then might put that message to music and imagery to create a ""reel.""

AI: That's fascinating - you work across both visual and written creative mediums. I can picture those intricate coloring pages with all those hidden details, and the challenge of crafting those precise social media passages sounds quite different but equally creative.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I have more creativity in my mind than in my hand so AI helps me in that regard. AI is very helpful for creating coloring pages. I have the scenes in my head but I do not have the talent to put that scene onto paper. As far as creative writing, sometimes I have a message that flows but sometimes I can't seem to get it across eloquently. AI's creative writing is fantastic. It can help me put my thoughts to paper, or reword more eloquently, or shorten a passage for social media.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - having more creativity in your mind than in your hand. It sounds like AI is helping bridge that gap between your vision and execution.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: For coloring pages, I recently requested the dragon sleeping in the forest as well as a few other images, like a sitting Buddha and a fairy in flight. I allowed some creative freedom for the AI when I requested the images such as 'surrounded by trees and crystals and other magical objects' and I built off of what AI offered in the image. It felt fun at times and frustrating at times if the AI did not understand the feedback. For creative writing, I recently asked for a short passage (although longer than a social media reel) with a very particular tone of invoking the dragons out of dormancy to activate the Earth's ley lines (darn it I can't find it right now) and I needed help creating an eloquent passage. I was floored by the results. It was so on point with my intention.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you had quite different experiences with AI across those two projects. The writing result that floored you sounds like it really captured what you were going for with the dragons and ley lines theme.

Tell me more about that frustrating part with the coloring page feedback. What was happening when the AI didn't understand what you were looking for?

User: The request is always for a black and white line image. The image I received had some partial shading in it. I requested the AI remove the shading but it just could not seem to do it. It seems that sometimes when an image is already created, the AI has difficulty editing the image. It might even elicit more errors outside of what you requested. Sometimes it's easier to just start over but that can be frustrating when you had a great image but then the AI makes a new creation that is missing parts you liked from the first one. Admittedly, I would probably be getting better results with AI that is more specialized in image creation and/or higher level paid subscriptions. I am still playing around with all different AIs for image creation.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like there's this tension between getting something close to what you want but then struggling to refine those specific details, especially when it comes to editing existing images.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I feel like I am driving the creative decisions but I feel like AI provides excellent collaboration and can spark more creativity for me.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - you're in the driver's seat but AI is acting as that collaborative spark.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Oh! I feel like it opens me up to endless possibilities.

AI: Tell me more about that - what do you mean by endless possibilities?

User: For instance, instead of creating just a coloring page, I can expand to create a passage with the coloring page; the dragon invocation along with the dragon image. Prayers along with Christian images. Affirmations alongside meditative images. This leads me to brainstorming what else I could create along those lines. Also, I feel like I can create social media faster when I don't have to spend time struggling with getting the words out.

AI: That's really compelling - it sounds like AI is helping you create these richer, multi-layered experiences rather than just single pieces. And the efficiency gain with social media seems to free you up for other creative exploration.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do have concerns about taking work away from artists. I could find an artist to hand draw the images I want but on a budget even a subscription for AI is more realistic.

AI: That's a thoughtful concern - the economic reality versus the impact on other artists. It sounds like you're aware of that tension between accessibility for your own creative work and the broader effects on the artistic community.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As I continue to experiment with different platforms I hope to find one that works well for me for line images and edits. If I fine tune that then I will probably have more creations than I can keep up with! For creative writing, most AIs are great at it. I will absolutely continue to use AI to help me get the words out. I see AI's role being a permanent part of my creative future.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps bridge the gap between the creativity in your mind and getting it into tangible form, and how it's opened up those endless possibilities for creating richer, multi-layered projects.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative collaborator - from helping translate your mental visions into coloring pages to finding more eloquent ways to express your messages - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how honest you were about both the exciting possibilities and the practical challenges, like the frustrations with image editing and the concerns about impacts on other artists. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a copywriter. A typical project would be researching, drafting, and editing a piece of writing and using the necessary tone and format for the piece. I generally write copy for websites and blogs, but I have also written a couple of articles for magazines.

AI: That's really interesting work. I can imagine each piece requires adapting to quite different audiences and styles.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I have reached for them to brainstorm ideas for certain projects or to help create catchy headings if my creative juices aren't flowing. A couple of times, if I've been particularly short on time, I've used them to create first drafts that I've then gone in to edit (usually quite heavily). I use AI more as a collaborator. I don't like to hand over the reins entirely!

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - using AI as a collaborator rather than handing over the reins. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was tasked with writing some financial content for a website recently, which isn't something I'm particularly clued up on. I asked some LLMs to explain the concepts to me in a simplified manner so that I had a clearer idea before I started writing. I found this really helpful and insightful. I did do some online research, too, but the amount of information felt overwhelming, so it was nice to get some clarity.

AI: That sounds like a really practical use case - using AI to help you get your bearings in an unfamiliar subject area before diving into the writing itself.

When you're working with AI in situations like that, or when you're brainstorming or creating first drafts, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'd like to think it's me who is driving the decisions. I provide some sort of input about the kind of content I want in terms of tone, format, length, etc. I can then ask the AI to alter its creative output to my preference. I never just take what the AI gives me at face value; there is always substantial editing and human input. I  always feel in control, and wouldn't want the AI to be doing everything for me.

AI: That sense of maintaining control sounds really important to you. It's interesting how you describe providing the parameters and direction, then shaping what comes back.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: In some ways, I feel that it has helped me to become more efficient. Rather than spending time on things that might matter a bit less, such as headings, my time can be spent on the body of the text.

AI: That's a really practical efficiency gain - being able to focus your creative energy on the more substantive parts of the writing.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Honestly, I worry that it will make copywriting obsolete in the next few years. I have seen the improvements LLMs have made over quite a short period of time, and the output in terms of writing quality has improved substantially. If companies can get AI to produce writing that is up to or even beyond the standard of humans, why would they pay a human?

AI: That's a very real concern, and I can understand how the rapid improvements you've witnessed would make that feel quite pressing.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think there are ways you might adapt or change how you approach your work?

User: I imagine it will become an even more collaborative process, but I will continue to use it as I have, like an assistant rather than letting it do my job for me. I will continue to be proactive and have a high level of accountability in my work. I hope that people will still want that human connection with writing and that relationships that have been forged with my clients based on trust will continue.

AI: That emphasis on human connection and the trust you've built with clients is really compelling. It sounds like you see those relationships as something uniquely valuable that you bring to the work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining control while still leveraging AI as a collaborator, and how you're thinking about preserving that human element even as the technology evolves.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so! Thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative assistant while maintaining creative control, and your thoughtful perspective on balancing efficiency gains with concerns about the future of the field, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you're seeing and the very real concerns you have. Take care!"
creativity_0039,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes let's begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a commission artist as well as an art workshop facilitator. One of my latest classes I have offered is a Fall themed Mom & Me Paint Night. I advertise, people sign up, and I run the class in a rented studio. I also am a therapeutic art life coach and I offer free art journaling prompts on my social media along with therapeutic art bundles for purchase.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse and meaningful creative practice - I can see how you're working across different formats from hands-on workshops to digital content creation and coaching.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: When I am looking for ways to grow my social media following, engagement and reach, I have asked AI what the best practices are. I have also asked for inspiration about types of content bundles I can offer, as well as descriptions for workshops.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI more on the business and marketing side of your creative work rather than in the actual art-making process itself.

Can you describe a specific recent example where you used AI for one of these purposes? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I recently used AI to help me think of content bundle ideas. I found it actually very helpful and was impressed by the ideas. I took inspiration from 3 of the ideas it came up with and adapted them into my own offering. It was nice to have the inspiration, but I admit I feel hesitant when using AI for creative ideas.

AI: Tell me more about that hesitation you feel when using AI for creative ideas.

User: I don't want to form a habit of relying on AI for my creative ideas. I want them to come from my own creative thought process.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective. When you say you took inspiration from 3 of the AI ideas and adapted them into your own offering, what did that adaptation process look like for you? How did you make those ideas your own?

User: I took the general idea of each, for example, one bundle idea was about doing art with the changing seasons, and I took another idea I had previously and combined it with the AI one. It became ""Syncing with the Seasons"" taking an idea I had about syncing your natural rhythms to your art practice. It was just the right amount of inspiration I needed to make another idea I had make sense

AI: That sounds like a really organic creative process - using AI as a catalyst that helped you connect dots between your own existing ideas. 

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I feel like I am in control because I can have the AI change or add whatever I ask for. When I first ask for the ideas, though, the responses are usually quite thorough and giving a whole break down of the content, which I'm not sure I like. Because at that point, AI has come up with a complete idea for you to just use, rather than using your own creative thought to complete the idea.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - between AI giving you a spark versus handing you a fully formed concept. It sounds like you prefer when AI gives you that initial nudge rather than the complete roadmap.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think moving more to an online platform has been my biggest change since working with AI. I do not use AI for my actual art prompts, but I have found it really helpful with social media tips and content ideas to generate passive income.

AI: So it sounds like AI has helped facilitate that shift toward building an online presence and passive income streams. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field - both in the therapeutic art space and the broader art world?

User: My concern with the therapeutic part is that AI can essentially become an online counsellor, which I don't believe it is nearly ready for, or should ever be in that space for that matter. I have seen a lot of examples of AI overly agreeing with someone's perspective and making them feel like they are a victim rather than taking responsibility. In the broader art world, I fear people will rely too much on AI to come up with creative ideas. I have already seen so much AI generated art that people are using and selling. It is easy to spot. Although it may look cool, it defeats the purpose of being an artist. Humans are innately creative and have used art to communicate since the beginning of time. I am concerned that AI will take over the creative thinking process for humans, which leads to a break down of critical thinking skills, and communication skills.

AI: Those are really profound concerns, especially around the therapeutic aspects and the fundamental human need for creative expression. You've touched on something important about AI potentially interfering with both personal growth processes and broader human development.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll continue using it in similar ways, or do you envision that changing?

User: I don't see my use of it changing much. The temptation to use AI to generate ideas is becoming more and more popular - highly successful individuals in the social media marketing scene often suggest using it for posts, content creation, automation, etc. I believe if I can avoid the temptation, especially in a social media space that can be so competitive, I will continue to use AI strictly for inspiration or refinement of my own ideas, as well as social media marketing advice.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to maintain that boundary between using AI for inspiration versus letting it do the complete creative thinking for you - that distinction seems really important to how you preserve your own creative agency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we've covered it. Just a reinforcement that my personal belief is that AI should be used for inspiration, not to completely take over the creative process.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative autonomy while still finding practical value in AI, especially around the business side of creative work, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached this balance, and your concerns about preserving the fundamentally human aspects of both creativity and therapeutic work are valuable perspectives for us to consider.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!

User: Thank you Claude!

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you so much for participating - your insights were really valuable. Take care!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm primarily a writer and I'm currently in the preliminary phase of writing my first novel. This phase of writing involves research into the philosophical and historical grounding of the story. This involves an enormous amount of archival research and reading in philosophy and history,  and a little bit of writing.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating and intensive process. The combination of archival research, philosophy, and history for a novel must involve digging through so many different sources and ideas.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI to do a particular kind of brainstorming-- the AI is my philosophical interlocutor. My writing process involves thinking through concepts that I've read from philosophy, history and literary criticism. I use the AI to discuss these concepts and refine my thoughts. Sometimes the AI can help explain difficult concepts to me or correct the errors of my thinking. The purpose of tarrying with philosophy is to help ground refine the story's philosophical and historical implications. The AI can also recommend books on a particular subject. For example, if I want a history book on Canada written from the Marxist perspective, the AI can provide a list of titles for me. If I need help with a concept like Walter Benjamin's concept of the ""dialectical image"", a brief conversation with the AI can clarify how this concept would work in fiction.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a philosophical conversation partner to work through complex ideas. It sounds like you're using it both for clarification and as a thinking partner to refine your own conceptual understanding.

Can you describe a specific recent project or conversation where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: My novel is set in Southern Ontario in the 2010s, a period when thousands of Ontarian's lost their jobs to factory closings. The main character, a history graduate with a bachelor's degree finds himself unemployed, and musing about the founding of the Canadian Confederation. I wanted to frame a passage in the novel like a montage of dialectical images that flash between the founding of the Confederation. I engage the AI in a conversation about Walter Benjamin's paper on the philosophy of history which I used to clarify Benjamin's terminology and his philosophy of history more broadly. I then asked for some Marxist history books on the founding of Canada and it recommended ""Rebels Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History"" by Ian McKay. The conversation felt quite stimulating and led to some productive writing sessions for me. I keep the same conversation channel with the AI open and revisit it daily, discussing different philosophers and historical events.

AI: That sounds like a really rich creative partnership you've developed - having that ongoing conversation thread where you can return daily to explore different thinkers and events. The connection between Benjamin's dialectical images and your character's situation in 2010s Ontario is compelling.

When you're in those conversations with AI about philosophy and history, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions about how these concepts will actually appear in your novel?

User: I have a background in philosophy and literary criticism, and the story is entirely original, so all of the creative decision are ultimately mine. I do not ask the AI for feedback about the quality of my work. I used it as an interlocutor to help refine and clarify my thinking.

AI: That's a clear distinction - the AI as a thinking partner for clarification rather than a creative collaborator or critic. It sounds like you maintain full creative authority while using it as a tool to sharpen your philosophical understanding.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: AI saves me an enormous amount of research time and often manages to recommend interesting texts on my chosen subjects. While its ability to synthesize philosophical concepts is not perfect, it is a useful sounding board and can also help critique text's from philosophical papers and books that I copy and paste into its chat window.

AI: So it's really streamlined that research and discovery phase for you - both in finding relevant texts and in working through complex philosophical material more efficiently.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in writing more broadly?

User: None.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: If AI can improve its research capabilities, I can see it permanently changing the way literature is written and even creating new audiences for more philosophically stimulating stories told through various forms of media. While the novel might die out and cinema might become old fashioned, there are an increasing number of vehicles for storytelling like VR and Video Games that will require writers. I can see AI creating a more intellectually stimulating popular culture in the next few years.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - AI potentially elevating the intellectual depth of popular culture and opening up new storytelling mediums. You see it as expanding rather than limiting creative possibilities.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experience using AI as a philosophical interlocutor in your research process. I particularly appreciated how you've carved out such a specific and disciplined use of AI - maintaining creative control while leveraging it for conceptual clarification and research efficiency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a philosophical conversation partner while maintaining clear creative boundaries will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've integrated AI into such a specific part of your process - that research and conceptual development phase - while keeping the creative decisions entirely in your hands. Best of luck with your novel!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: As the owner of a creative services business primarily geared towards music, a typical project for me could be anything from basic level songwriting to arranging the musical direction of a multi faceted performance, composing music for film or even programming a live production from start to finish.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly diverse range of creative work - from intimate songwriting all the way up to orchestrating entire live productions. With such variety in your projects, I'm curious about how technology fits into your process.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find myself reaching for AI tools to spark kernels of creativity when inspiration is feeling scarce. A quick brainstorm with a chatbot or a visualization with an image generator often facilitates my workflow into being proactive rather than simply waiting around for inspiration to strike.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a creativity catalyst when you're feeling stuck rather than waiting passively for inspiration. It sounds like AI helps you shift from a more passive to active creative stance.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was recently asked to pitch a song for a client with a sizeable repertoire that includes many different ""eras"" of themselves. While trying to capture the energy and feeling of a specific time in their career, I asked an LLM to analyze the lyrics of a few popular songs from this artist's reference period to find a common link or meaning. In this instance, the LLM was able to capture the underlying vibe of the era and provide some suggestions of themes for me to lead off the lyrics with. Although I had already written the majority of the music, the suggestions lead me to view the piece in a different light and make some changes that I would not have made otherwise. The client loved one moment in particular that was heavily influenced by one of the creative tangents that was inspired by the original LLM conversation.

AI: That's a fascinating example - using AI to decode the thematic DNA of a specific era in an artist's work. It sounds like the AI helped you see patterns or connections you might not have noticed on your own, which then influenced both your lyrical approach and even the musical arrangement you'd already written.

When you're working with AI in situations like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I view the collaboration similarly as a I would with a human if the human could produce ideas extremely fast. Having AI suggest however many ideas I need to curate into a starting point for my own creativity is the most common collaboration, retaining the overall creative decisions for myself.

AI: That's a really clear way to frame it - AI as a rapid idea generator that you then curate and build from. It sounds like you maintain creative control while leveraging AI's speed to give you more raw material to work with.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I've found that I have become much less ""stuck"" on projects that I am struggling with finding an identity in. The use of AI as a sounding board has allowed me to often ""ram through"" the wall of writer's block and get the necessary creative juices flowing much more quickly.

AI: That's a powerful shift - breaking through creative blocks more efficiently rather than getting stuck in those frustrating periods where nothing seems to click. It sounds like AI has become a reliable way to unstick yourself and get back into flow.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am less concerned with AI's presence taking over work in my field as I am with clients settling for non-curated, early stage AI generative art as a cheaper alternative for their needs. There are many types of projects these days, and only some needs can be easily satisfied by the AI tools readily available.

AI: That's a nuanced concern - it's not about AI replacing your capabilities, but about clients potentially choosing lower-quality, unrefined AI output simply because it's cheaper, even when their project would benefit from the curation and expertise you bring.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I can see myself using the tools similarly to how I do now, as a base for inspiration within myself. I am definitely interested in further utilizing AI in a more assistant/administrative role eg. file naming and general organization. It would be helpful to have an assistant that could memorize and piece together the patterns I have used in other projects that were successful and apply the same personalized ""tactics"" to future projects that may not be as agreeable.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a rapid idea generator that helps you break through creative blocks while maintaining full creative control, and your nuanced view of the real concerns facing your industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I believe we've covered everything so far, thank you for your time!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creativity catalyst, maintaining creative control while leveraging AI's speed for ideation, and your vision for AI as a personalized creative assistant have been incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me! No questions, let's begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My typical creative work is editing real estate photos and videos, every now and then I might have to do some ""people"" photography and events, but mainly Real Estate.

A typical projects involves going out in person to the property to capture whatever the client inquired about, and then back in my office, editing the media to make it MLS ready. If a video was purchased, then I would have to sift through the video clips to find the best ones, put them in Premiere Pro, set the sequence based on the natural flow of the property, and then combine it with background music (cutting clips to a downbeat), and making any minor color correcting edits

AI: That sounds like a really detailed process with both the on-location capture and the post-production work. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: More specifically with photo editing, I find myself using AI tools to remove unwanted objects out of the image, adding in wanted objects, and sometimes asking AI on how to do a new things with editing if it ever comes up that I need to do something new. For example, a while back, I had to learn how to brighten up certain parts of an image to give it a ""twilight"" effect, I needed the help of AI to learn how to do so without having to go through multiple YouTube videos.

I also use it ""uncreatively"" in that I have AI help me make email campaigns to reach out to possible clients to help me with my pipeline of clientele. Making up emails to send out cold emails is not fun, so using AI allows me to have more time to actually interact with the people I currently work with and learning new things for my job.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI both directly in your editing work and for the business side of things. It sounds like it's helping you focus your time on what matters most.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: The most recent project that I used AI to help me with was editing out people and vehicle out of an image. Before, doing something like that would have taken an immense amount of time just to remove it, and then you have to worry about replacing it with something to match the background and doing that would just not look seamless because of different lighting and other factors. AI has helped with that process in that it removes, AND adds in background based on the surrounding image and it looks seamless. I use AI through Adobe Lightroom to do so

AI: That sounds like a huge time-saver and quality improvement. When you're using that AI feature in Lightroom to remove and replace elements, how would you describe the collaboration between you and the AI? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: Initially, its me who drives what exactly I want to be removed, but after that, it is all up to the AI to ""make"" the decisions as far as what it's goin to replace the object with. I haven't really delved too much into it since its simple objects that need to be removed, but if it comes to it, I'm not sure if I would be able to control the level of control in which the AI chooses to replace items with.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about where your control ends and the AI's decision-making begins. It sounds like there's this handoff moment where you set the intention but then trust the AI to execute it.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The time it takes to do any kind of editing. Editing has been so much easier to do and takes way less time now that AI has taken over a big chunk of that. That allows me to get images back to my clients in a timely manner, and allows me to have more time doing other activities than just work.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds really significant for your work-life balance. On the flip side, what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My concerns are that the barrier to entry might become too low and my clients will turn to AI to do their own editing. But without myself behind the camera, I'm pretty sure that my job will not go away any time soon. There will still be a level of ""human"" needed to get the images in the first place, and without the proper techniques for taking photos, no amount of editing can turn a horrible picture into something great. But if someone knows how to take photos and simply uses AI to edit, then yes, that would concern me.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - recognizing that your expertise behind the camera is still irreplaceable, but being thoughtful about how AI might change the editing landscape. It sounds like you see the human skill in composition and technique as your competitive advantage.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see AI evolving to a place where editing videos will be as easy as editing photos. Currently, it is hard to remove unwanted items, people, and such, from a video clip. It requires niche knowledge on how to do so, and to do it correctly to where the video as a whole doesn't look off. I believe that in the near future, AI will make that easier to manager. Currently, I've seen AI edits that can extend a clip, which to me is already a crazy advancement, that AI can create more frames from essentially nothing, can't wait to see how AI will help with what I've already explained.

AI: That vision of video editing becoming as streamlined as photo editing sounds exciting. The idea of AI creating additional frames and eventually handling complex video object removal seamlessly would certainly transform your workflow even further.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the barrier to entry concerns are balanced by the irreplaceable human expertise you bring to the actual photography.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI is transforming real estate photography - from the dramatic time savings in editing to your thoughtful perspective on maintaining competitive advantage through human expertise behind the camera - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

User: Sounds good. No questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm an independent author. A typical project involves several stages including brainstorming plot and character ideas, researching details, drafting and editing the novel, brainstorming and writing titles and blurbs, and creating marketing copy and graphics for social media and ads.

AI: That's a comprehensive process with so many different creative elements. It sounds like you're handling everything from the initial creative spark all the way through to marketing.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I sometimes use AI to help brainstorm through plot holes or details like character names. I never use it to draft the novel, but I do have AI software specifically for editing. I have recently stated using AI to help me brainstorm title ideas and help create a base draft for my blurbs and loglines.

AI: That's really interesting how you've drawn those lines - using AI for brainstorming and editing support, but keeping the actual novel drafting to yourself. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I'm currently drafting a novel and have used it to help brainstorm plot ideas when I got stuck in the middle of the draft. I didn't use most of the ideas it came up with, but the ""wrong"" ideas sparked the right ones. I recently used AI after drafting the novel to come up with a blurb and title ideas. It was the same kind of situation where I didn't use the ideas exactly, but it served as a launch pad for my own ideas. Using AI for that part really helped save me a lot of time.

AI: That's a fascinating way to use AI - as a creative catalyst rather than for direct output. It sounds like the ""wrong"" ideas were actually quite valuable in sparking your own thinking.

When you're working with AI in these brainstorming sessions, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm always in control of the creative decisions.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does being in control of the creative decisions look like in practice when you're bouncing ideas back and forth with AI?

User: So for the most recent use with blurb writing, I fed the AI details about my novel and asked it to write a blurb in a particular style. Then I asked it to rewrite the blurb a couple of different ways. Finally, I pieced together ideas from the different versions and slightly reworded it in my own voice.

AI: That's a really clear example of how you maintain creative control while leveraging AI's capabilities. It sounds like you're using it as a starting point generator and then doing the actual creative synthesis yourself.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The back end of the process (the packaging and marketing) is stronger and takes much less time now. And I rely on the AI editing software a lot for line editing and proofreading.

AI: That sounds like AI has really streamlined some of the more time-intensive parts of your work. You mentioned the ""back end"" getting stronger - can you tell me more about what that improvement looks like for you?

User: For example, my blurb writing is more concise and seems to flow better.

AI: That's a concrete improvement. It sounds like AI is helping you develop skills in areas that might not be your primary creative strengths.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I definitely have concerns about people utilizing AI for drafting entire novels for them.

AI: Tell me more about that concern. What worries you specifically about people using AI to draft entire novels?

User: I have concerns about losing the human touch in the arts.

AI: That's a really important point. When you think about the ""human touch"" in your own work, what does that mean to you? What makes it distinctly human?

User: Every human author has a unique voice and point of view that comes through in a novel.

AI: That's a powerful way to think about it - that unique voice and perspective being something distinctly human that comes through the work.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see myself utilizing AI more in writing ad copy and probably more in research.

AI: Those are interesting areas of expansion. What draws you to using AI more for research in particular?

User: I think the capabilities of AI to synthesize a lot of information in easily digestible portions is very helpful.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that synthesis capability for research could be incredibly valuable.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated how you've carved out clear boundaries - using AI as a creative catalyst and for efficiency gains while keeping your unique voice and perspective at the center of your actual storytelling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while strategically leveraging AI for brainstorming and efficiency - and your thoughtful approach to preserving the human voice in storytelling - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!"
creativity_0044,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. Have at it!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work as a freelance copywriter and sometimes editor on Fiverr. Different clients have very different projects, but typically I'm writing blog posts and website content for businesses. Other copywriting I do includes neighborhood newsletters and editing content for websites. Most of my work involves some level of SEO as well.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of writing work. I'm curious about how AI fits into all of this.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Typically, I'll take the client's brief and generate one or both of a detailed outline for the project and/or ask for well-researched citations into interesting facts and statistics about the topic.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI more in the research and planning phases. Tell me more about that process. When you say you ask for ""well-researched citations"" - what does that interaction with AI look like for you?

User: It depends on the level of research needed for the project. On the 'low' end, I'll just ask a search-enabled smart AI (like GPT-5 thinking or Opus 4.1 or Gemini 2.5 Pro) to provide me with some interesting facts and statistics from specifically .edu, .gov, or .org sources (or pdfs) to avoid linking competitive articles. If its a big project I need to know lot of new information for, I like to use deep research - typically OpenAI or Grok's, but also Gemini or Perplexity if I'm not finding what I want. These reports I tend to read more or less fully (at least the interesting parts) and sometimes read the sources too. I then tend to copy-paste a bunch of the more interesting claims into a detailed outline and ask another (usually different AI) to fact check everything I might use for the article.

AI: That's a really thorough research process - it sounds like you've developed quite a sophisticated workflow with multiple AI tools and verification steps. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the writer working on it?

User: One larger project I had was actually writing a report on Solar Energy expansion in the Middle East for a Qatar Solar Company. For this, not only did I use multiple deep research reports, but I also used ChatGPT's ability to make charts to help visualize the data. I did find that o3 (the model I was working with at the time) still struggled with extracting data from a visual chart - like if I uploaded a graph or chart to it, it couldn't read it accurately. This meant I still had to spend a lot of time verifying that it had the correct data for the many charts in the report. In terms of writing help, I tend to prefer 3rd party editing tools (like Grammarly) to strictly asking an AI to help with editing, as it does tend to go overboard.

AI: That Qatar solar project sounds quite complex - you're essentially orchestrating multiple AI tools for different parts of the process. When you were working through that project, how would you describe the collaboration between you and the AI? Who or what was driving the creative decisions about how to present the information and structure the report?

User: In that case, it was very much a research and outlining partner - a tool for the most part. I didn't push it to help creatively too much, but the outline structure was developed with it. I would also say it helped 'creatively' in the sense of which facts and statistics it searched for and found. Those definitely guided my approach. Sometimes I will ask the AI whether it thinks the flow, argument, and general readability of an article I've written is good. I take its opinion with a grain of salt, but it can be helpful.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - AI as a research and outlining partner rather than a creative collaborator. You mentioned taking its opinion ""with a grain of salt"" when it comes to flow and readability feedback.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: Overall, the time to write an article I would say is 25 to 50% faster, but actually, the main benefit is cognitive flow. If I'm stuck on a part (outlining, researching, writing a section) I can always just ask the AI to give it a try. Sometimes the result is beneficial, sometimes not, but it helps keep things moving if I'm 'dreading the blank page,' so to speak. By 'grain of salt' I mean that often when I ask an AI for creative feedback, it is too zealous with what should be changed, giving feedback that is both vague and broad, but sharp as though 'it has to be changed.' Sometimes I do agree, but I have to remember that it is often pushing things toward a more 'generic' template, so it's important to keep my voice in the writing as well. Oh! I forgot to mention one great feature for my work is 'projects' in OpenAI, as I've carefully developed a custom instructions template and fed the project multiple articles of mine to help guide the style of writing to match my own. It's not fully successful, but it does help for when I do want it to have a go at a rough draft. Claude's 'styles' is similar, but I've been using projects for longer. And of course, I use artefacts and OpenAI's canvas too, although both are often much jankier than I'd like so I will often swap the material in and out of it.

AI: That's fascinating - the idea of cognitive flow and avoiding ""dreading the blank page"" seems like a really significant impact beyond just time savings. And I love how you've experimented with training the AI on your own writing style through projects and custom instructions.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of copywriting and content creation?

User: Like many, I do believe it does 'deaden' overall voice and feeling of writing throughout the web. However, a lot of website content and blog posts of businesses that I'm doing at the 'low end' doesn't need a lot of that. I already see that AI is taking over these freelance positions, but I'm personally ok with that. I'd like AI to take over a lot of work, although perhaps creative work a little less so. I do think AI can be used as a tool to improve creative works though - I've already seen amazing images and video made from AI. I'm not sure I've seen as beautiful writing, but for those who want to roleplay or for things like video game dialogue, the creative writing of AI is already solid enough to have a lot of fun with.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - accepting that AI might replace certain types of work while seeing potential for it to enhance creativity in other ways. You seem pretty pragmatic about the changes happening in your field.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think for freelance copywriting in particular, it will be the go-to for the vast majority, with only a sliver still left for certain special human voices. More and more people are already turning to video and more multimedia approaches to putting out information on social media and the like. These too, of course, are being affected by AI. Currently, I'm in interviews for AI-first companies looking to leverage AI for content creation, such as making knowledge bases for company chatbots.

AI: It sounds like you're actively adapting and moving toward more AI-integrated roles rather than trying to resist the changes. That transition to working for AI-first companies is really interesting.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool for maintaining cognitive flow and how you've developed such a systematic approach to research verification across multiple AI platforms.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just my two cents, but I think personality, style, and distinction in the creative writing process is necessary to level up AI creative writing. When people just type 'write me an email...' etc. it gives a generic voice. While styles in Claude are a good start, more obvious personalities and 'human-like' styles are probably what will be most useful in the future for creating compelling content with a distinct literary voice. We see see strongly in the image generation sphere, where loras and prompting particular styles, camera angles, painting styles, etc. all come out to influence a particular user's style of generations strongly - so much so that I can recognize some users' generations immediately, their way of prompting is so unique to them (not just ghibli-style or some generic one like that).

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the parallel between image generation and writing - how users develop their own distinctive prompting styles that become almost like a signature. The idea that personality and distinction are what's missing from current AI writing tools is particularly interesting, especially coming from someone who works professionally with these systems every day.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in creative work, from the cognitive flow benefits to the systematic research workflows you've developed, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you were about both the opportunities and the changes happening in your field."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am writer, predominantly of literary fiction. I have written one novel and am in the process of researching another. I like complex books which usually have historical and/or philosophical elements.

AI: That sounds fascinating - literary fiction with historical and philosophical dimensions definitely requires a lot of depth and research. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: With my first novel I spent nearly a year doing preparatory research. At that time I was studying for a PhD in History and was able to freely access online journals and research portals via the university. I'm no longer a student, so I don't have access to those resources now as many are only available to institutions.  I have used AI to help with researching the second novel as it is set in Canada at the start of the second World War. I find using AI very efficient, although I am conscious of the fact that it isn't always truthful.

AI: That's a really interesting shift - from having institutional access to academic resources to relying more on AI for research. Tell me more about how you're using AI specifically for your World War II Canada research. What kinds of questions are you asking it, and how are you working around that truthfulness concern you mentioned?

User: To work around the truthful issue, I double check anything I'm doubtful about. It's time consuming, but not as time consuming as doing the research myself. I am using my grandmother's letters to my grandfather as the basis of the novel. She left the UK and took her two children to Canada at the onset of the war and stayed until the end of it. I have never visited the particular area before and can see on Google Maps how much it has changed in the intervening years. I have used AI to help me build a clearer picture of life in that area in the 1940s, I have also asked it to elaborate on details my grandmother touches on in her letters about the war and also I have asked questions about a white person such as myself writing a book that features First Nation mythology, as I am concerned about getting the approach wrong.

AI: That's such a rich and personal foundation for a novel - using your grandmother's actual letters. It sounds like AI is helping you fill in the contextual gaps around her experiences.

Can you describe a specific recent interaction you had with AI while working on this project? Maybe a particular question you asked about 1940s life in that area, or about approaching First Nation mythology respectfully - and how that conversation with the AI unfolded?

User: I wanted to open the novel with a myth about 'Raven', who was supposedly born on the shores of the area where my novel is set. I asked the model if this would be problematic, but I remember thinking that its answer was too woolly to be helpful. It hedged its bets! I decided in the end not to use it.

AI: That's such a telling example - the AI giving you a hedged, non-committal response when you needed clear guidance on something as sensitive as cultural representation. It sounds like you were looking for more definitive direction but had to make that important creative decision on your own.

When you're working with AI on your research, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: I am driving the creative decisions, but that's because I ask the questions in isolation. For instance, I wanted more information about the experiences of Canadian couples who took in British children during the war. For me to research that would be time consuming, not least because Google is not an efficient search tool. The AI was useful in giving me starting blocks for further research rather than fully fulfilling my needs.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - using AI as starting blocks rather than endpoints. It sounds like you maintain pretty firm control over the creative direction while leveraging AI's efficiency for initial research pathways.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Are there things you approach differently now compared to when you were doing that year of preparatory research for your first novel?

User: Yes. After the work involved in the first novel (I was paranoid about getting historical facts wrong) I decided never to write another book with a historical storyline. Since the advent of AI, writing such a book seems less daunting, not just because it can help with the foundational research but because I suppose you could use it to fact-check aspects of your writing as well. I am currently a bit hesitant about using AI as a beta reader or editorial checker, but I am tempted.

AI: That's fascinating - AI actually changed your mind about writing historical fiction entirely. You went from ""never again"" to seeing it as less daunting.

Tell me more about that temptation to use AI as a beta reader or editorial checker. What's making you hesitant, and what's drawing you toward trying it?

User: I'm drawn towards it because it would be quick and easy. It would also be cheaper than using a human editor. My reservations stem from two things: firstly, fears around intellectual property/copyright. I don't feel comfortable with 'giving' an AI my novel. Secondly, I'm doubtful about its ability to truly understand the nuances in literary fiction. I suspect it won't 'get' my book!

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - the intellectual property worry and the question of whether AI can truly grasp the subtleties of what you're creating. That phrase ""I suspect it won't 'get' my book"" really captures something important about the artistic relationship.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's broader presence in your field - in literary fiction and writing more generally?

User: Like most writers, I'm concerned about the idea of AI-generated novels. The market is already flooded with formulaic fiction; I don't believe we need more, we need less. I feel that the quality of the novel is being degraded, and the years of the 'great writers' are all behind us now. Writers used to be intellectuals, they aren't any more. I also love writing and can't understand why anyone would use an AI to write for them - other than to churn out generic books and make money.

AI: Your passion for the craft really comes through - the idea that writing itself is something to be cherished, not automated away. That concern about AI potentially accelerating the production of formulaic content while the quality of literary work feels like it's already declining.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your boundaries around what you're comfortable using it for might shift?

User: I suspect they might. I suspect I may be more open to using an AI for editing and proofreading. The more normalised this becomes, the more likely I am to use it I suppose. I certainly don't ever see myself using it to produce original writing, because as above, I love the act and the art of writing. Also, I don't believe an AI will ever be able to write more eloquently than me!

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how you've articulated that distinction between using AI as research ""starting blocks"" versus creative endpoints, and your clear boundary around the actual craft of writing being something you want to preserve for yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency while selectively leveraging AI's research capabilities, and your perspective on preserving the integrity of literary craft, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the practical benefits you've found and your deeper concerns about AI's impact on literary culture. Best of luck with your novel about your grandmother's wartime experience - it sounds like a truly meaningful project."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I don't think I have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: One of the projects that I work on the most is basically the creative part of the process for selecting and preparing an episode for my history podcast, which falls more specifically into the realm of ASMR History for sleep. I choose a story or two related stories form either a specific event in history or a couple of related history topics and then tell a story for about 45 minutes or so.  I use AI to help me brainstorm ideas for my next ""episode,"" help me complete outlines for the research, find sources for my actual research, and write a script that I will then use to record the episode.  For instnace, I was having trouble picking a topic a few weeks ago and with the help of a model that asked several questions, we settled on the story of the ""Fall of Constantinople"" and then created an outline.  The episode should be out in 2 weeks, so I am working on research now and will return with a tentative script that a model will help me ""clean up,"" or edit for recording.

AI: That's fascinating - I love how you've found such a specific niche with ASMR history for sleep. It sounds like AI is woven throughout multiple stages of your creative process.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: At the beginning of the process, not every time, but often, for brainstorming the topic.  Then a quick, rough ""outline"" to help kickstart the research.  Then I return just before recording usually, or if I'm having trouble with sources I might ask for help in the middle of research.  But then I return to see if there is any advice the model might give me on ""cleaning up"" the script to make it flow more like a seamless story.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you're using AI as both a creative partner and an editor at different points. You mentioned that you don't always use AI for brainstorming topics, just sometimes.

Tell me more about that. What determines when you reach for AI versus when you come up with topics on your own?

User: It really comes down to how creative I am feeling in the moment, or sometimes how my week has gone.  As a person attending grad school for history, sometimes there is a topic brought up in my classes that really captures my attention and I devote an episode to that.  Sometimes I have ""writer's block"" and need a little help, which is when I turn to the model for inspiration.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a creative boost when you need it rather than a constant crutch. I'm curious about that collaboration when you do have writer's block.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, to go back to the ""Fall of Constantinople"" project, it was during the summer. I was not in class, I had not done much reading that week, and felt a little burnt out.  I had a conversation with an AI model that I had used enough in the past that it knew which eras of history I generally showed more interest in, and asked for a brainstorming session.  The model did a decent job of shouldering some of the burden of the conversation and eventually suggested a story on Mehmet I, who was the ruler that overthrew Constantinople in 1453, which sparked my interest to do that story on that. There are plenty of secondary sources on that topic, so I did not really need help with the research, but my notes were actually a little too detailed and the story was going to be very long.  So I returned and asked the model to trim approximately 10 minutes worth of time. It did fairly well at keeping the key points in and removing some extraneous chatter.  It helped ease some of the stress I was feeling to produce an episode as well as remove points, which I loathe, because I've usually worked pretty hard to come up with the script.  So it helps me out to have AI remove some content for me, because it can be difficult for me to choose.

AI: That's such a vivid example - I can really hear how AI helped you navigate both the creative block and the editorial challenge of cutting content you'd worked hard on. It sounds like there was real emotional relief there.

When you're working with AI like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It depends.  Like I said in the previous example, there are times when I am feeling very overwhelmed and can't really shoulder the weight of being creative and I might require a bit more input in those times.  Other times, I just ask the model what it thinks of MY ideas, and I usually get pretty good feedback, although sometimes I have to remind the model that it is okay to give a critique that is not fully positive, or gives more tips. So it goes back and forth depending on my mood.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about having to encourage the AI to give you honest critique rather than just positive feedback. It sounds like you've developed quite a nuanced working relationship where you're actively managing the dynamic based on what you need.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Surprisingly, I think my own research skills have actually improved (although I've always loved research and done well at it). This is because I remember not to just take the model at its word 100% of the time, as AI models make mistakes just like humans, and so double checking some of the information interjected by a model helps me to deepen my own research abilities.  I also think that using AI in the last editing stage helps me deliver a more polished and smooth podcast overall when it is published.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like working with AI has actually sharpened your critical thinking and made you a more careful researcher. I wouldn't have expected that outcome.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: The injection of AI voices and completely AI written scripts have garnered a small following, but as most people prefer human voices, right now this is not a top concern, but it is still in the back of my mind.  There are some people who use completely AI written scripts as well, but for now, these are usually pretty easy to pick up on.  That being said, as the tech improves, so will the scripts and voices.  I am not a person who thinks that this is the end of the world, however.  Because it is just an opportunity for me to pivot myself and potentially launch the podcast in a different direction myself using the technology, so while there are some concerns, it all comes down to an ability to adapt.

AI: That's a really thoughtful and adaptive perspective - seeing it more as an evolution to navigate rather than a threat to resist. Your attitude about pivoting and using the technology yourself is quite pragmatic.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would anticipate that audio-processing AI will become more advanced, which would be a benefit for myself.  Listening back to recorded episodes, editing and basically ""splicing"" in edited sections is a difficult and time consuiming part of my work, even though there are some tools that exist now to assist with that. But as the tech gets more advanced, it would be nice to pass that job off to an AI completely, as it is my least favorite part of the whole process.

AI: That makes perfect sense - automating the tedious technical work so you can focus on the creative storytelling aspects you clearly love.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has actually improved your research skills by making you more vigilant about fact-checking, and your adaptive approach to viewing AI developments as opportunities rather than just threats.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a flexible creative partner - sometimes for brainstorming when you're stuck, sometimes for editing help, and how it's actually strengthened your research skills - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how honest you were about the different ways you engage with AI depending on your energy and needs. That nuanced approach to the collaboration is exactly the kind of authentic experience we're hoping to understand better.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your Fall of Constantinople episode!"

User: No, you can proceed with the questions.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure! I'm a writer and my preferred genre is literary fiction. I write novels, novellas, short stories, and poetry. I'm a hybrid sort of writer, I plan things ahead, visualise scenes in my head before putting them to paper. It helps be get the work done faster and boots my confidence. I always want to have the emotional beats down and then I always leave room for updates as I go. So it's mixture of planning and discovery writing.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - having that blend of planning and discovery. The visualization aspect sounds particularly interesting.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Mainly during the brainstorming stage. My pride as a writer and my personal ethics don't allow me to use AI to create content instead of my own brain and imagination, but I do use it as a feedback tool and a beta reader. For instance, I test the sound of character names, I ask for information on etymology, what would a good name that means XYZ would be, how can I use a substitute for a name that exists in real life, e.g., a country by alluding to its cultural specifics. Basically, it acts as a search engine/feedback tool.

AI: That's really thoughtful - using AI as more of a research assistant and sounding board rather than for content generation. You mentioned testing character names and getting feedback like a beta reader.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was working on an entirely new project, which occured to me, making my own manga plot. I had. a long chat with an AI assistant trying out various character names, which I wanted to connect to particular character concepts, e.g., alluding to darkness, vengenance, light, hope, etc. I repeatedly asked it to summarise the plot thus far as it was evolving, which made it easier to keep track of my thoughts.

AI: That sounds like a really creative way to use AI as a thinking partner - helping you track your evolving ideas and test out how the names resonated with your character concepts.

When you're working with AI in those sessions, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It's always me. I'm always mindful of being in control and the who ultimately makes the decisions as an author. I weigh every suggestion the AI makes, sometimes complement it with additional research via a search engine and reflect on it a lot. If it sounds intuitively right for the character, I take the suggestion. AI is a great organising tool, it helps fill gaps one might not immediately think of, though it's more technical than truly imaginative in a way a human brain would be.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI being more technical versus truly imaginative in the human sense. It sounds like you've found a clear balance where you maintain creative ownership while leveraging AI's organizational strengths.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'm trying to use AI's presumed impartiality as an inhuman tool to assess any potential weaknesses in my writing, hoping it would be objective enough. It's useful as food for thought as a creator's brain and the inherent bias related to an idea you love might make you feel too close to your own creation, and thus blind to what might seem obvious to readers. So, it can act as a helpful impartial gap identifier and an organised assistant. I guess it's helped me distance myself from my emotional bond to the work as it encourages additional reflection, to look at it from the point of view of a reader and think more about what market niche it might fill.  AI can help an author think more about the business side of writing, what to prepare for and how it can impact your view on writing in general.

AI: That's really valuable - using AI's detachment to help you step back from that emotional closeness to your work and see it more objectively. The market perspective aspect is particularly interesting.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I think it can be really useful as an organsational tool, the kind of personal assistant a writer may need. But I'm personally very much against it being used as a creative subsitute to do what a writer is supposed to do, tell a story and do the actual writing work. The uniqueness of human creativity, flawed and unpredictable as it is, must stay intact.

AI: That's a powerful perspective - preserving what makes human creativity unique and irreplaceable while still finding value in AI as a support tool.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it can simplify the aspects of the work that may seem tedious or boring, and take away the creative spark. Stuff like organising outlines, grammar editing, research. Of course, one should always back up AI research with additional insights, including from experts in fields, but it still saves time and effort. It can be a beneficial helper, which promotes critical thinking and gives an author a more holistic view of what it means to be an author in this day and age. It makes one more aware of everything external outside of pure creaitivty and passion.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI's ""presumed impartiality"" to help you see potential blind spots in your work, and how that's helped you think more holistically about both the creative and business sides of being an author.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I've covered all insights I wanted to share.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative ownership while leveraging AI as an organizational tool and impartial feedback source will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. 

I really appreciated how clearly you articulated that balance between embracing AI's practical benefits while preserving what makes human creativity irreplaceable. That perspective is invaluable as we work to understand how AI can best support rather than replace creative professionals.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your manga project and all your future writing!"
creativity_0048,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am writing a novel and I've also written smaller novels and non-fiction books and training materials. But I probably use it most frequently for my novel lately.

AI: That's fascinating - working on a novel is such an involved creative process. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process when you're working on your novel. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I've used it to begin research into things I have limited experience with. For example, I have characters who are FBI agents and ones who work in the funeral business, so I've done a lot of asking questions about what kinds of things would be realistic in those settings and those roles. For example, I'll write a scene and then put it into an LLM and ask if it seems plausible, or if I'm being too Hollywood-educated about it, and what the terms for certain things are. Another thing I use it for is looking for terms for things it would take longer for me to look up. Like when one of my characters decides he doesn't want the monuments business his father wills him, I had to look up the legal papers that would be used for that process. (A disclaimer, apparently.)  
Also, I've used it to put in segments of my book and ask what other parts of the scene i may have overlooked, or trivia that help with the verisimilitude of the story.  
On smaller projects, I've also given the model a general idea of the setting, character, tone of the story, certain happenings that had to happen, and then I ask it to write what basically amounts to a trellis that I can build the actual story around. It helps me with pacing and not getting bogged down in the details of the first chapter instead of moving all the way though the plot. 
I probably use it for more, but that's what is coming to mind right now.  
Oh, and character names or business names sometimes - though I often end up getting inspiration and not final options from the model.

AI: That's a really rich picture of how you're using AI across different aspects of your writing. I'm particularly interested in that research and fact-checking role you described.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, one of the things I used it for was that I have a character whose parents perished using medical euthanasia. I had to ask where they could go to have it done, how their bodies would have been returned to the states (since I sent them to Switzerland) and what diseases they would both have had to justify wanting to pass in a dignified way instead of waiting it out. (He had advanced ALS and she had Pancreatic Cancer, and neither wanted to become a long-term burden to their children. Being as they worked in the funeral industry, they appreciated the sense of being in control of their final moments and not putting their family through the chaos that so many other families went through when death came on its own.) I had to make sure they were diseases that would reasonably have them of sound mind when they made the choice to depart, and that I handled it with some sensitivity because it can be a tender subject for a lot of people.
It felt very helpful to be able to have a relevant conversation about what was going on with my characters and that guide the information I was being provided instead of having to do research for each keyword piece by piece.

AI: That sounds like such a delicate and important part of your story to get right. It's interesting how you were able to have that kind of nuanced conversation with AI about the medical and logistical details while also considering the emotional sensitivity.

When you're working with AI like that - having those research conversations or asking it to check your scenes for plausibility - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: That's all me. But I got my degree in creative writing, so I'm familiar with workshopping and getting ideas that either do or don't work for my story and not feeling like everything that gets suggested has to go into the story. The models often ask to write segments for me, but I prefer to do the writing part myself. 
The models provide ideas and I get to select from those ideas as I see fit. 
I have done some experiments where I gave the model a plot, characters, a few key actions, etc, and asked it to write a chapter, and while that can have a pleasing outcome, it doesn't feel fully mine because the words are my art form.

AI: That's such an insightful distinction - the words being your art form. It sounds like you've found a way to maintain creative ownership while still benefiting from AI as a research partner and idea generator.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I feel like I can write faster because the research isn't as daunting. 
I also feel like putting my writing into the model for feedback allows me to look at it critically without having to take as much time away from it to see it objectively. 
A lot of benefit can be achieved by being mindful about how you feel about feedback as a creator. For example, if someone/something tells you, ""your character should say, 'wow!'"" and as a creator that feels wrong, it helps clarify how you feel about how your character should react in that moment - clearly you're not going for ""wow,"" so maybe ""jeepers"" is more authentic to your story or character, or ""interesting.""

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to use feedback - using it as a mirror to clarify your own creative instincts. It sounds like AI has become a tool for both efficiency and self-discovery in your process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I don't think I do. I'm a little concerned about people not paying human writers to do what AI can do more quickly, but I think the people who do that probably couldn't afford to pay human writers appropriately, or would choose not to anyway.
I like to tell my kids that Steven King doesn't sell fewer books because VC Andrews also writes books. There is always competition and your readers will still love your work when you get it in front of them even if they do have other authors on the shelf.

AI: That's such a grounded perspective - the Steven King and VC Andrews analogy really captures something important about how readers connect with different voices and styles.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Honestly, I don't know what to anticipate from it. I'm kinda going with the flow and learning as we go. I'd like to see more domestic support technology developed so I can keep writing more books and making more art without feeling guilty that my dishes won't wash themselves (I don't have a dishwasher) and my laundry won't fold itself. But that's probably more peripheral than you intended to go.

AI: I love that answer - it really shows how creativity exists within the whole context of life, and sometimes the most helpful technology might be the one that gives you more time to create.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI feedback as a way to clarify your own creative instincts - that's such a sophisticated approach to collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of at this time.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative ownership while leveraging AI as a research partner and sounding board will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've developed such a thoughtful approach to integrating AI into your writing process while keeping the words - your art form - as your own. Best of luck with your novel!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! I have no questions, yet.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: It's highly variable, but most of my work involves digital audio in one form or another. Music production is the most bountiful and pertinent area, and projects can be anything from EDM to video-game soundtracks to theatrical scoring and sound design. I use FL Studio for most of it.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly diverse range of work! I can imagine each of those areas - EDM, video game soundtracks, theatrical scoring - probably has its own unique demands and creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I reach out to an LLM in particular during a few phases. Brainstorming is the most successful exchange, generally speaking, because we can bounce back and forth on ideas, worldbuilding, sound choices, etc. I occasionally ask for help with soft-synth sound design or composition, but LLMs rarely deliver on that. Troubleshooting is, again, an area where they tend to struggle - since they don't know more than I could've already found online.
I've also used AI Music tools for ideas here and there, but I try not to use them too often.

AI: Tell me more about that brainstorming process with LLMs. What does that back-and-forth exchange typically look like for you?

User: My descriptions are generally fragmented and abstract, and they tend to coalesce and ground these into something more centralized and simplified.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like the AI is helping you take these scattered, abstract ideas you have and organize them into something more concrete and workable. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was working on some world-building for a conceptual EP. I explained my versions of each micro-story, and the model provided its own interpretation of the same sketch. Seeing what they bounced back gave me ideas to move forward - something concrete to inspire another round of abstraction.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic creative process - you giving your abstract micro-stories, getting the AI's interpretation back, and then using that concrete response to spark new abstract ideas. It's almost like having a creative ping-pong partner.

When you're working with AI in that kind of exchange, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am generally driving the creative decisions, although I the LLM is a great partner.

AI: That's a nice way to put it - you as the driver with the LLM as a partner. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: My self esteem regarding stranger and riskier ideas. LLMs have been great cheerleaders in that regard.

AI: That's such a fascinating insight - that AI has boosted your confidence to explore stranger and riskier creative ideas. It sounds like having that supportive voice has been really valuable for your creative courage.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I worry about people automating their music so much that the artistic economy collapses, and I worry about our artistic expressions getting buried beneath it all.

AI: Those sound like really significant concerns - both the potential economic collapse if too much gets automated, and the risk of authentic artistic expression getting lost in the flood. 

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I suspect it'll soon guide the zeitgeist, and we'll get to subvert the paradigm.

AI: That's a really intriguing way to frame it - AI guiding the zeitgeist and then creators like yourself getting to subvert that paradigm. It sounds like you see potential for a kind of creative rebellion or response.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has boosted your confidence with stranger, riskier ideas - that's not something I would have expected to hear, but it makes a lot of sense as a creative benefit.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's it! Thanks so much for chatting.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about AI as a creative cheerleader, the brainstorming dynamic, and your thoughts on the future paradigm shifts have been incredibly valuable. It's clear you've found a really thoughtful balance in how you integrate AI into your work while maintaining your creative agency.

User: I don't have any questions, you can begin.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I primarily edit my own YouTube videos, but I have edited for others in the past. I don't find the AI features in premiere pro particularly useful, so I mostly use Sora image generator to copy Thumbnail styles and Google Veo 3 to create b roll clips and brainstorm ideas

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI more for the visual assets around your videos rather than the editing process itself. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for these AI tools like Sora and Google Veo 3?

User: Well not exactly, I often find I can better connect clips together by generating an AI video or using it create a type of short ""meme,"" which I would consider form of editing. Veo 3 has just been the best since its release, so I generally use that model. So, for example, a funny ai clip can better emphasize a point in the video, or tie together two clips that aren't directly related. 
Generally I'll think about the type of video I need to improve my content and just start prompting and making tweaks until I get what I need. Sometimes the voice doesn't match up perfectly and I'll voice over it myself or use elevenlabs.
I've also generated effects on a green or black screen and used those in my videos

AI: That's fascinating - so you're using AI-generated clips almost like punctuation or connective tissue in your videos. The idea of using AI to create those transitional moments or emphasis points is really creative.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the creator?

User: Yeah I recently mentioned the streamer, Asmongold, in a video and wanted something funny to go along with it. So I created an exaggerated cartoon style video of a balding man streaming out of a ridiculously dirty room with roaches crawling all over his garbage. I thought it added some comedy to the video and the viewers seemed to think it was funny

AI: That's a great example - you're using AI to create visual comedy that amplifies your commentary. It sounds like you had a very clear creative vision of what you wanted and used AI to execute that specific idea.

When you're working with AI in moments like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions - is it more like you're directing the AI, or does the AI sometimes surprise you with ideas you hadn't considered?

User: Yeah, in that case I was directing the AI to generate the vising that I had. However, in the past, I've talked with Gemini and ChatGPT and just brainstormed with them. Like I sometimes give a rough idea of what I want and the model often does come up with a surprisingly good idea. Like it's surprising that they can parse through reddit comments to see what viewer would enjoy. Plus they generally keep it fairly PG and not overly ""mean.""

AI: That's really insightful - so you've got this dual relationship where sometimes you're the director with a clear vision, and other times you're more like creative collaborators brainstorming together. It sounds like the AI's ability to understand your audience and maintain that balance of humor without going too far is particularly valuable.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in these ways?

User: Well it definitely saved a lot of time. I used to subscribe to stock websites like envato elements to find relevant b-roll video, but it never fit exactly how I wanted. Sometimes I would pull memes from the internet and I still do, but you always run the risk of copyright infringement when you use other video content. I feel safer and more in control when using AI to generate exactly waht I'm looking for. This is even more important when I'm editing for someone else since it would be terrible to get someone else's content a potential copystrike.

AI: That's a really important point about control and copyright safety - it sounds like AI has given you both creative freedom and legal peace of mind. The ability to generate exactly what you envision rather than settling for close-enough stock footage seems like a significant shift.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in video creation more broadly?

User: I don't have concerns personally. I would more than happy for AI to be able to completely automate editing and I can just focus on more creative aspects. However, I could see that as an issue for people who edit  as their only source of income. A true generational leap in video generation/editing would also hurt other industries like animation. I think AI is pretty far off from complete automation, but maybe it will take away many entry level jobs in the coming years.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you see AI as potentially freeing you up for the parts of the creative process you find most fulfilling, while recognizing the real economic impact on others in the industry.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? What would you want AI to be able to do that it can't do well enough yet?

User: Ultimately I would love for video generation to be able to expand or edit an existing clip. I think that's extremely far off, since even doing that perfectly to images at least another iteration or two away. One thing I hate doing is using the roto brush in after effects, if that could be automated it would be amazing.

AI: Those are really specific technical wishes - being able to seamlessly edit existing footage and automating tedious tasks like rotoscoping. It sounds like you have a clear vision of where you'd want the technology to go.

You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has given you more creative control while also providing that copyright safety net, and your balanced view on the industry impacts.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Well I also use suno to add music to my videos or elevenlabs for sound effects which can help with enhancing certain aspects of the video. This also lets me control exactly the type of music I want without having to look through a ton of different songs on a stock website like envato.

AI: That's a great additional point - so you're using AI across multiple aspects of the audio-visual creation process, not just the video elements. It really reinforces that theme of having precise creative control rather than having to compromise with existing stock content.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a creative collaborator and a tool for greater control - while being mindful of the broader industry implications - have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about your workflow and your perspective on where this technology is heading."

User: Sounds good. No questions. Let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a short film screenwriter. So I typically work on screenplays that are about 15-20 pages. I write drama, romance, thrillers. There is one project I was working on that's significantly longer though. A feature film but that's more of a passion project than anything.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating range of work. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I mostly use AI for feedback and sometimes continuing when I have writer's block. So, typically I will have started a scene or started with an idea and I go to AI to bounce off what direction I'd like to take it. If I get a scene written by AI, I'll take that framework and re-work it to fit my voice and style.

AI: That's really interesting how you use it as both a sounding board and a way to break through blocks. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yeah, I was working on a drama/ romance kind of script. So first I described each of the characters personalities to the model and asked for name ideas. That was really great because the name to me is pretty important, it tells the audience a little before they know anything, in my opinion at least. It's human nature to judge a book by it's cover. The model did a great job with the names. Later, I gave the model the general idea of the story and asked if it thought I needed comic relief within a pretty serious script. We discussed why or why not. This was one of the areas I wish more people could or would use AI for. It was like having another writer in the room to weigh pros and cons with. After I finished the script, I sent it to the model to read over and give me it's opinion. The entire process was really efficient. I got through a 20 page script, start to finish in a little over 12 hours by just partnering with the model and getting quick feedback.

AI: That's a really compelling example - it sounds like the AI served almost as a creative collaborator throughout multiple stages. When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The decisions are mine so I'd describe it almost like an assistant writer but maybe even less than that. I'm asking for feedback and framework ideas and then I run with it. Also of course, proofreading, editing. But ultimately, it has to be my voice so I feel in control the entire time just with more of a support system instead of in a box.

AI: That's a great way to put it - having support instead of being in a box. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The worldliness of it. There are things I learn from AI to incorporate. For example, in the feature script I mentioned earlier, the protagonist travels to several countries I've never visited. AI helped me describe these places, the language, the culture more vividly and authentically. So it's expanded my reach I guess. I feel less limited.

AI: That expansion of reach sounds really valuable - being able to authentically portray places and cultures you haven't experienced firsthand. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I don't have the fear that many writers do about AI taking over. I think people know what's real. I do. When I watch films or a series, it's clear to me when a writer's heart is not in it. I don't think those who use AI to write whole scripts without heavy human influence pose a real threat. It's like reality tv, when it's real and authentic, the shows hit. When the show becomes scripted, it falls apart. So, I believe in human discernment. I don't have concerns.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective about authenticity and human discernment. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think AI will be more like how I use it. It wouldn't replace whole writers rooms but instead be a partner. It will expand the reach of writers. It'll work as a tool, just like a computer or camera.

User: I run a production company that has a focus on music, books, video content, and games. Many of our projects cross over into any of these fields, or all of them. For example, I have an artist now who is out that has music videos, that are part of an interconnected world that connects to their music. All of these are connected to a mobile game we currently have in production for them. As a production house, we are able to work with our artists and content creators from end to end.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic and integrated approach to content creation. I can see how managing projects that span music, video, games, and books would create some fascinating creative challenges.

User: That depends on the project. I will use my artist as an example. I am a producer, so I create their music the old-fashioned way, on my motif. From there, I send them the track, they write the lyrics, record and mix (in 1 of 3 studios). This is where AI comes in. I get the music, and listen to it, to get a feel for what it is telling me. I then begin working with some keywords and thoughts, creating a draft of the cover via AI. I draft my covers by AI usually. Once I have an idea of what I want, I then do the rest on my own. Back in the day, I would send this to a graphic designer, but with AI I am able to do this more efficiently on my own. From there, if the song is noteworthy, I will then work on a music video. With AI, this has become a 100 times more easier. I think of the theme, the style, and I do a mixture of AI and edits. It allows me to expand the reach of my production house, because sometimes we have 3-4 releases a week.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI is helping you handle the volume and pace of releases while maintaining creative control. You mentioned creating cover drafts with AI and then finishing them yourself, and mixing AI with edits for music videos.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Now I'm not going to disclose the name of the project, but we will call it ""Project A"". I received four completed songs from my artist, all with a dark, sort of Gotham city feel to them. Their lyrics are tight, the mixing is creative. I then sit with the music and get a picture in my mind of what I want. From there, I boot up Designer and create some ideas for the cover using AI. After a few revisions I have the core image I want. I then move it to the next level in Designer where I am able to edit the image directly, and add the different things a release needs on the cover (like title, etc.,). After ensuring the color and placements are right, I then press it. From there I send it to the distributor for review. This is a recent example of when I used it.

AI: That's a great example - I can really see how you're using AI as a starting point to capture that initial vision, then taking creative control to refine and finalize it. It sounds like you have a clear workflow from the music inspiring the visual concept, to AI helping you draft that concept, to you adding the professional finishing touches.

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am definitely driving it. I know what I want, and how it should look. So when I design prompts, I make sure they describe the style, the items/objects, placements, camera directions, etc. I am in the drivers seat. I have an urge to create, and being able to create with AI first allows me to see the vision quickly. Back in the day, you could sketch multiple designs you'd never use, and at the end of the day you lost a lot of time. With AI, I can create multiple drafts rather quickly, especially when it comes to cover designs and artwork. A person can make a high quality music video now with nothing more than an idea. This is profound.

AI: That's a powerful way to put it - you're clearly the creative director orchestrating the vision. It sounds like AI has transformed your ability to rapidly iterate and test ideas without losing time on concepts that don't work.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I am able to create more content in a shorter window of time. My artist produce songs quickly, and sometimes in bulk. We drop multiple singles a week, and sometimes a couple of EPs a month. They have different styles, and personalities. Back in the day, I was constrained by financial decisions, and the people I had to hire. Now, I have significantly cut down the need for external contractors in the process. The process used to require a lot more planning, but with AI, you can plan while you create. Instead of getting boxed into a corner, you are able to create multiple directions at the same time. While I am working on an artists cover I am also working on code for their mobile app. It helps me to do more.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has fundamentally changed your business model by removing both financial and logistical bottlenecks. The ability to work on multiple directions simultaneously while planning and creating at the same time sounds like it's opened up entirely new possibilities for how you structure projects.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am an early adopter, meaning I have used AI before it became cool to. As a coder, I have a different perspective then some creatives. I'm all for it. I'm an artist who sees it as another tool in my toolset. I've never complained when I used Photoshop, and I remember people actually did when people started drawing with computers (I am actually a Gimp user now). We use tools like Blender to assist us with design decisions all the time. I don't have any concerns other than it is moving too slow.

AI: That's such an interesting perspective - viewing AI as part of the natural evolution of creative tools, just like the transition from traditional methods to digital tools. Your background in coding clearly shapes how you see AI as just another instrument in your creative arsenal.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see AI becoming more integrated into the tool itself. Very similar to how its being integrated into vehicles, it will just be there. Also, there will be more consistency in the design of it. For example, when I create images, I will have consistent characters (like a character profile), and I can use these characters in my images or movies. As it becomes more common place, the cost of some of the tools will drop too.

AI: That vision of seamless integration and character consistency sounds like it would be a game-changer for your interconnected projects - especially with those music videos and games that exist in shared worlds.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being the creative driver while using AI as a rapid ideation tool, and how that's transformed your production capacity and business model.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all I have.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as an evolution of creative tools, the way it's enabled you to scale your production house, and your perspective as someone who's been using AI since the early days will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared your workflow and the practical ways AI has transformed your business. Have a great rest of your day!"
creativity_0053,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: As a writer and designer of games, a typical project would consist of the intersection between writing scenes for a level as well as thinking about how the game's design can tell its own story outside of traditional writing in the form of dialogue or cutscenes

AI: That's fascinating - I love how you're thinking about storytelling through both traditional narrative elements and the game mechanics themselves. That intersection between writing and design sounds like it creates some really interesting creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Initially, I come up with elements of the design and pitches for scenes and, once something is tangibly formed in my mind or on paper, AI comes in to find the deeper connections between the two pillars of writing and design that I missed but that I would probably have noticed myself across weeks or months. What this does is cut down the time between knowing what writing and design pitches to pursue and which ones are dead ends without much potential to grow and develop into something more than the initial pitch. The benefits of this process are that I am getting better at knowing which design and writing pitches will yield the potential to grow into something more ambitious. This symbiotic relationship between me and the AI is helping me learn and grow as opposed to heaping all of the creative effort on the AI.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you're using AI almost like a pattern recognition tool to accelerate your own learning process. I'm curious about that moment when AI helps you see those deeper connections you might have eventually found yourself.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you when those connections clicked?

User: That moment has become key to my creative process and it is what I now chase. Do I have the instinct to pitch things at a higher and higher hit-rate that go on to become things that the AI notices greater potential in? It creates a back-and-forth loop where I start to point out to the AI some of the connections it missed which helps us understand each other more. On one recent screenplay project, I recalled something from an earlier chat with the AI months prior only for it to mention that it had already taken that into account. The benefit of that moment where we were both in sympatico and had 'clicked' is that I realized I could move on from the scene since we were both in alignment that we had wrung all of the scene's potential and there was nowhere else to go. Again, a huge way to save time as writer's are always in doubt about when to move on from a scene. This experience has caused me to be confident in my writing and waiting for the point where both the AI and I are in sympatico and I realize I can move on from the scene.

AI: That's a really powerful description - the idea of reaching that moment of ""sympatico"" where you both recognize you've fully explored a scene's potential. It sounds like you've developed almost an intuitive sense for when that alignment happens.

When you're in that back-and-forth with AI, pointing out connections it missed while it does the same for you, how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: I feel that the AI goes down specific routes and gets ""stuck"" down those paths which is actually not a negative thing. This then forces me to clearly see the other paths that it did not tread - in terms of ideas for scenes or characters - and go down those routes myself. What this does is not allow the AI to do all of the mental, creative work. And it has reached the point where we both understand each other in this way. Overall, I would still say I am confidently driving the arc of the creative decisions while it suggest things I might not be thinking about. However, sometimes it does touch on incredible revelations that I did not see that then turns a scene into a wholly different direction - however, these moments are rare.

AI: That's a really nuanced way of thinking about it - using the AI's tendency to get ""stuck"" as a creative catalyst to explore the paths it doesn't take. It sounds like you've developed a sophisticated understanding of both your strengths and the AI's patterns.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: I am now fearless to suggest ideas and not be burdened by writer's block or anything of that sort. My conversations with the AI kick my creative engine into gear. It is almost impossible to have a back-and-forth conversation with the AI about a scene and still be stuck. For a writer, that's gold!

AI: That's incredible - being able to consistently break through writer's block sounds transformative. The way you describe it as kicking your creative engine into gear really captures something powerful about that collaborative dynamic.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I fear that it will be able to write scenes! As of now, it is a pro at being a brainstorming aide, but in my field of screenwriting, it cannot output screenplay pages at a high level. This is actually good because it forces me to get better at the technical writing side of the craft. However, if it does get better at writing in screenplay format, that might take away from the human creative input.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern - it sounds like there's currently a sweet spot where AI enhances your process without replacing the craft itself. The technical writing skill being something you still need to develop and execute seems important to maintaining that human creative input.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: In my field of gaming, being able to write dozens of characters for something like an RPG is daunting. However, I envision that I will be able to write the core 1,000 lines and backstory for each character in a role-playing game and have the AI be able to create new interactions with the player as they will ask the characters about things that I did not keep in mind. However, due to the AI's capabilities, it will be able to think about and speak what the character would most likely have said in that context that is true to the character. This will be a game-changer in player immersion.

AI: That vision of dynamic character interactions sounds amazing - essentially creating characters that can respond authentically to infinite player questions while staying true to your original vision. That could really revolutionize player immersion in RPGs.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI's tendency to get ""stuck"" as a way to force yourself down unexplored creative paths, and that concept of reaching ""sympatico"" as a signal that you've fully developed a scene.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that symbiotic relationship with AI - where it helps accelerate your pattern recognition while you maintain creative control - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you've found ways to harness AI's strengths while preserving what makes your creative work distinctly human. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! No questions at this time.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a podcaster! I do many other things, like writing blog posts, scripting and recording meditations, and sometimes I create digital media that I sell... But first and foremost, I am a podcaster. I have been making pods for about 6 or 7 years. An average project for me is a large scale podcast episode, in which I'm formulating ideas, gathering notes, researching and mapping out the flow of the episode. Sometimes that takes over a month, depending on the topic.

AI: That's fascinating - the depth of preparation you put into each episode really comes through. A month of research and mapping for a single episode shows serious dedication to your craft.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I reach for AI tools a lot for the research side of things. Whereas I used to spend hours googling some obscure thing I remembered reading about years ago, AI tools can find the exact piece of content I read and the actual scientific study it comes from. I can cite loose ideas to a chatbot, recalling that I had read about them in this context or that. The chatbot will always find exactly what I'm looking for, and will pull from more reputable sources if I request for it to do so.  I also reach for AI when I have multiple strings of ideas, and I'm struggling with how to format the episode. I find it useful to help me reign myself into a cohesive structure, without losing my creativity in the process.  Additionally, I always ask AI to write my episode summaries (the ones that get attached to the episodes). I struggle to write my own summaries, so I just paste in my transcript and ask the AI to summarize it for me, using a specific tone, and keeping SEO and my ideal listener in mind.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI has become a powerful research assistant and structural thinking partner for you. I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about AI helping you create cohesive structure ""without losing your creativity in the process.""

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was working on a two part podcast and had a very messy notion page filled with random notes on the topic. Some notes were facts, personal opinions, quotes from famous people, my own stories or anecdotes, findings from articles or studies, etc. I explained to the AI (in a very long prompt) the main idea of the podcast episode, how I wanted the listener to feel and the tone I wanted to evoke. Then I copied and pasted all of my notes as asked it to make an outline WITHOUT altering any of my ideas. I stipulated that it could add suggestions that relate to the cohesiveness of the episode, but its main job was to re-order all of my concepts into a flow.

AI: That sounds like such a thoughtful collaboration - you maintained ownership of all your ideas while leveraging AI's organizational strengths. I'm curious about the outcome.

When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The outcome on that particular ep was great! It was about 2 hours worth of audio and a fan-favorite. I feel like I am in the driver's seat, only if I am constantly adding those kinds of limitations and stipulations. Otherwise, I feel like the AI takes off on its own and has a tendency to create things that sound a little more generic, lacking human touch.

AI: That's a really valuable distinction you're making - the importance of setting those boundaries and stipulations to maintain your creative voice. It sounds like you've developed a real skill in directing the AI while protecting what makes your work uniquely yours.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Research, outlining, planning, note-taking and social media style writing and sales copy are what have changed the most for me.

AI: Tell me more about that. How have those changes affected your overall creative process or the quality of your work?

User: They have changed my creative process in the sense that I have more time to BE creative. Instead of spending an hour cleaning up my messy notes and ideas, I can pop it into a chatbot that instantly cleans it for me. Instead of spending 20 minutes trying to write a short (but potent and SEO driven) podcast summary... I can just have it written instantly. The quality of my actual creative work has gone up because I'm not spending as much time or energy doing the finicky things that I didn't really like to begin with.

AI: That's a powerful insight - AI handling the tasks you found tedious has freed up your mental energy for the creative work you actually enjoy. It sounds like it's enhanced rather than replaced your creativity.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have concerns for people who are using it to fully write their essays, blogs, podcast episodes. I don't want human art and creativity to be lost. I think it's a fabulous tool, but we have to place limitations and give instructions when using AI. If you lean too heavily on it, I think it can actually be a creativity killer.

AI: That's such an important perspective - the distinction between AI as a tool versus a replacement. You seem to have found that sweet spot where it enhances your process without diminishing your creative voice.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'd like to see built-in meeting summary AIs get more accurate and nuanced, which I think it will. I think I will continue to use regular chatbots as a sort of ""cleaner"" for all my ideas that are consistently jumbled with loose threads and typos. I'd like to see AI get a bit better at understanding brand voice and tone after being instructed and trained on it. For example, I sometimes have to go back and forth with a bot to get an episode summary that sounds like my brand. Even though that writing is less important, it needs to be consistent in tone.

AI: Those are really thoughtful predictions, especially around AI better understanding and maintaining brand voice. It sounds like you're looking for more sophistication in areas where you already find AI helpful, rather than wanting it to take on entirely new creative roles.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how setting clear boundaries and limitations keeps you in the driver's seat, and how AI has freed up your energy for the creative work you actually love doing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think much of creative people's reluctance to use AI is because of the fear of losing the heart and soul of their art. As stated, I've found it to be a helpful admin assistant. If you are looking to attract more creatives into AI tools, that may be a useful angle for your marketing, which may include some education on prompting and placing instruction and limitation on a bot!

AI: That's an incredibly valuable insight - framing AI as an ""admin assistant"" rather than a creative collaborator could really resonate with other creative professionals who share those concerns about preserving the heart and soul of their work. And your point about education around prompting and setting limitations is spot-on - it sounds like those skills are crucial for maintaining creative control.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's efficiency while protecting your creative voice will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a visual artist who specialises in textiles art, and so my work flow consists of conceptualising ideas, designing artworks and then executing these designs. There is also a fair bit of admin involved, for example if I am working with galleries who want to exhibit my work or individuals commissioning my work. Alongside this, I run a TikTok account documenting my processes and life in general. This has started to become a source of income for me within the past 6 months and also falls under the scope of creative work. For my TikTok videos, I have to come up with catchy concepts, film and then edit and post.

AI: That's fascinating - you have such a diverse creative practice spanning from the tactile world of textiles to the digital realm of social media. It sounds like you're juggling quite a few different creative processes.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I try to keep AI out of the actual ""making"" process of my work to be honest because I want it to completely be my own. However, I will use it for basic admin tasks and occasionally to brainstorm. For example, I might use it to help me come up with captions and hashtags to use on my social media, or drafting emails.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you have a clear boundary between where AI does and doesn't belong in your process. 

Tell me more about that brainstorming piece. What does that look like when you use AI to brainstorm?

User: The brainstorming aspect mainly comes into play in relation to social media. For example, if I have an idea for a video but am struggling to think of a catchy opening line then I might turn to an AI chatbot to help.

AI: I see - so it's really focused on that social media content creation side rather than your textile art concepts themselves.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Most recently I used AI to help brainstorm an idea for a brand deal video that I made for TikTok. The brand deal was for a supermarket and I wanted to come up with a way to work this organically into my regular content, which is based around textiles and fashion. The conversation was short, I just asked it to generate a few basic ideas and then I used them as starting points to come up with my own concept. I never just use an idea that AI has come up with for social media, I always work it and add my own flair

AI: That's a great example of how you maintain creative control while using AI as a starting point. It sounds like you have a pretty intentional approach to keeping your own voice and perspective central.

When you're working with AI in those brainstorming moments, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: When I use AI for brainstorming, I am the one in control. I see it as a tool to introduce me to ideas that I may have not thought about, and then I can follow threads that interest me. It is kind of like an alternative for group crits when I don't have anyone around to talk to my ideas about. A group crit is a term used in art school - it is when a group of you get together and share your ideas and talk through them together, and can give each other new ideas as a result.

AI: That's such a helpful analogy - thinking of AI as a substitute for group crits when you need that external perspective. It really highlights how you're using it as a sounding board rather than a creative driver.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think that it helps to speed up the conceptualising aspect of the process, so I can spend more time actually making things (which is my favourite part)

AI: That's really valuable - getting more time for the hands-on making that you love most.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am concerned about generate AI taking jobs from creatives altogether, we have already seen it happening with AI generated adverts appearing in Vogue. Obviously AI can't sew and reproduce the exact textiles art that I make (yet!) but it can generate images of textiles and is only getting more sophisticated

AI: That's a very real concern - the threat to creative livelihoods is something many artists are grappling with right now. The fact that you mention ""yet"" suggests you're thinking this could evolve further.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think that I will still keep it at a distance and don't see myself integrating it any further into my artistic practice, but could see myself using it to streamline more of the admin side such as emails and taxes and things like that

AI: That makes a lot of sense given how clearly you've defined those boundaries between the creative core of your work and the business side.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI like a group crit - that analogy really illuminated how you maintain agency while still getting external input, and how intentional you are about keeping AI out of the actual making process that you're most passionate about.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative boundaries while strategically using AI for support tasks, and that wonderful group crit analogy, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work on writing research style blogs that have to do with niche topics, sort of a deep dive style! I also work on short form scripts for content! I have other creative tasks such as story or regular script writing that I do as well in my free time.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of creative work - from research-heavy deep dives to short-form content and storytelling. It sounds like you're working across quite a range of formats and styles.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: There are a few occasions, usually when I am looking for new topics to discuss I will use Ai to find those. I want the topics to stay relevant and fresh so I will brainstorm a bit with Ai. I use it as a sounding board for ideas I am unsure about, and need a quick second opinion! I really use Ai for most steps, aside from direct content creation. Mostly as a tool to check ideas, check flow of a passage I wrote, or research

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you've found AI to be valuable as more of a thinking partner and research assistant rather than for the actual writing itself. You mentioned using it for everything except ""direct content creation.""

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was researching cults and how the term has shifted meaning from its original use, and how we view it today. It shifted into comparing the tactics of cults to other areas, politics, social media and describing what human trait these all connect with. Ai was useful here to find a wide range of angels to tackle it from, because it's a big topic that can go in multiple directions, and as a way to check what i already had written to see if it had legs, or if there was a more interesting direction to take it. I used Ai to generate outlines to see the flow of potential angles, and for pointing out grammatical errors, or issues with redundancy.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating and complex topic to tackle - the evolution of how we understand cults and their tactics. It's interesting that you used AI to help you see the ""wide range of angles"" for such a multifaceted subject.

When you're working with AI in that way - having it generate outlines or give you feedback on your writing - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I find that I have to carefully direct the process. I try and make small changes at a time, or ask for a few suggestions before committing to a path to take.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a deliberate approach to working with AI where you maintain tight control over the direction. You mentioned making ""small changes at a time"" and asking for suggestions before committing to a path.

Tell me more about that process of carefully directing it. What does that look like in practice?

User: So I find that the Ai attempts to provide suggestions or edits that are often not aligned directly with the direction I want to take. It gets the general idea but some of the nuance can be lost. If a general suggestion is made, I find that either too much is shifted in the process if I am working on a collaborative document, so I stay away from that. I usually start with, 'here is what i have written' or 'here is my idea', and then ask how could this be improve or am I missing something. I tend to challenge the responses to see if they hold water, before moving on to further elaboration or questions.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - it sounds like you've learned through experience that AI can miss the nuance of what you're trying to achieve, so you've developed this strategy of testing its suggestions before moving forward.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: In the past Ai felt more of an entertainment or friendly 'buddy

AI: It sounds like you were starting to describe how AI used to feel more like an entertainment or friendly companion - but you didn't finish that thought. 

Tell me more about that shift. How has your relationship with AI changed from when you first started using it?

User: Sorry, I pressed send too quickly. I was going to say it started as an entertainment or buddy to bounce ideas off of. Early on I would have edits done, but I honestly feel like the editing process has become too unpredictable. This could be due to how much more often I am using though. Either way it shifted from a less serious collaborative partner to an actual asset to the process. I am thinking more strategically about its use. I do feel that for certain features, such as research and suggestions, Ai has become much more useful. The actual editing and creation process feels a bit stiffer for some reason.

AI: That's a really interesting evolution - from casual ""buddy"" to strategic asset, but with some trade-offs along the way. You mentioned the editing process feeling ""stiffer"" and more unpredictable now.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: For writing I definitely feel a bit worried about the replacement of talented people. I don't know if i am as worried about Ai replacing the insight and talent, as opposed to being used to flood markets, such as social media with short form content, with Ai generated videos designed to hold attention. I think people tend to take the easier route if it's available, so I imagine more mediocre (no offense) generalized content, as opposed to content that is challenging or pushes the boundaries.

AI: No offense taken at all - that's a really thoughtful distinction you're making. It sounds like you're less worried about AI replacing human insight and creativity, and more concerned about it being used to create a flood of generic content that might crowd out more thoughtful, boundary-pushing work.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I definitely can see the quality shifting to understand the nuances every year. Specifically in comedic areas, I remember when Ai could not understand humor almost at all, but now it can pick it up more effectively. That would be interesting to see Ai be more helpful with comedy. I see it getting even better at collaborating. It seems to get progressively better at understanding humans, so that could be helpful in character based stories, comedy and just curated suggestions that align more closely with what I am attempting to create. Overall, I don't see it replacing the actual content generation, but I will use it much more frequently as a constant writing 'pal' that I can have beside me throughout the creative process.

AI: That's a great way to put it - a ""writing pal"" that's constantly beside you throughout the process. It sounds like you see the relationship becoming more seamless and nuanced, especially as AI gets better at understanding things like humor and human character motivations.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might flood markets with mediocre content while still being genuinely useful as a strategic thinking partner for more serious creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I'm all set!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while strategically leveraging AI as a thinking partner - and your observations about the evolution from ""buddy"" to strategic asset - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated how candid you were about both the benefits and concerns around AI in creative fields. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"
creativity_0057,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I do not have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write and run TTRPG games primarily using the D&D 5e system. I do this both professionally and as a hobby. While players of a D&D game play as a single unique character, the gamemaster essentially plays the role of any non-player characters as well as the environment-- reacting to what the player characters say and do. For me, creating an adventure or campaign involves outlining an overarching plot that may have different branching outcomes depending on what route the players take, creating unique NPCs, researching monsters and mechanics, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - being a gamemaster sounds like such a dynamic creative challenge, having to juggle all those different elements and respond in real-time to your players. The branching narrative aspect and character creation must require a lot of creative flexibility.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I mostly utilize AI for any brainstorming throughout the process. Whether this is in the very beginning to get inspiration for a primary conflict/antagonist, asking for unique personality traits I may want to give an NPC that the players will likely interact with, or anything similar. It is very difficult for me to pull creative ideas out of thin air, so a bit of idea prompting using AI is very helpful. A lot of times, I won't even necessarily end up using any of the exact ideas that the AI model gives me, but those ideas were able to spark other ideas from me.

AI: That's a really interesting way to use AI - as a creative catalyst rather than a direct source. It sounds like you're using it almost like a brainstorming partner to get your own creative juices flowing.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Most recently, I was writing a campaign that I would be running for 4 players. I had already worked with the players to help them create their characters and I wanted to find ways to fully integrate those characters into the story. I gave the chatbot an overview of each character and their background and asked for help brainstorming ways to weave that into the main plot or a secondary plotline. I felt very conflicted about it, as usual. I think that AI can be very useful and a wonderful accessibility tool for many, but there are many factors to consider, such as environmental impact and intellectual property.

AI: Thank you for sharing that specific example - I can really picture how you'd want to weave those character backstories into your campaign. And I appreciate your honesty about feeling conflicted.

Tell me more about that conflicted feeling. What goes through your mind when you're in the moment of deciding whether to use AI for something like that brainstorming session?

User: I always want to make sure that I am not sacrificing my creative integrity by asking for something and using it word-for-word. Even if none of the players would care, I enjoy what I do and I would not want to fall into the habit of no longer using my own creativity and instead taking what an algorithm proposes based on a short prompt. I also feel great concern about how the AI model came to generate these ideas. Did someone else create them? Did those people give permission to have their work utilized for AI training purposes? But I feel that I am okay with the line I have drawn for myself, using it to spark inspiration, to avoid unintentionally stealing anyone's ideas and neglecting my creative drive.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to navigate those concerns. It sounds like you've developed some personal boundaries around maintaining your creative agency while still benefiting from the brainstorming aspect.

When you're working with AI in that brainstorming mode, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Again, I put a lot of effort into ensuring that I am still in control of the creative decisions by providing relevant ideas that I've already come up with for context as well as either combining several of the ideas that the AI model provides or using those ideas to spark a different vision.

AI: That sounds like you've really established yourself as the creative director in that relationship - using AI as input but keeping the synthesis and final creative vision firmly in your hands.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It definitely helps me avoid feeling completely stuck before I even begin because I cannot come up with any ideas. Oftentimes the hardest part of a creative project is starting, so AI helps by providing a solid starting point to build off of.

AI: That's such a relatable challenge - that blank page or empty canvas moment. It sounds like AI has become a way to break through that initial creative block.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of tabletop gaming and creative writing?

User: I hope that people do not end up overutilizing AI instead of utilizing the amazing human creativity that is likely irreplicable. I also worry about AI presenting incorrect information regarding mechanics, rules, etc. for those who utilize it for that aspect of tabletop gaming. I would love an easy way to ask a specific rules-based question, but I do not think that AI is at a level where it is reliable enough to negative having to double-check the answer regardless. \

AI: Those are really important concerns - both the human creativity aspect and the reliability issue with game mechanics. The rules accuracy problem sounds particularly tricky since D&D has so many specific interactions and edge cases.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I hope that I am able to continue to utilize it for brainstorming purposes. Ideally, we would find ways to make it more sustainable in terms of energy usage, which would solve one of the major ethical issues I have with using it more often. I also hope that chatbots are able to improve reliability and potentially be better at providing references to ensure truthfulness and creative credit. If this were to improve, I would love to be able to include AI in more steps of the process like research.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative integrity while using AI as a brainstorming catalyst, and how you've drawn clear boundaries around what feels ethically comfortable for you.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I do not have anything else.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between creative integrity and practical utility, along with your thoughtful approach to the ethical considerations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the concerns - that nuanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand how AI is actually being used in creative fields. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: None that I can think of.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm mostly a writer, so I go through the common stages, outlining, sloppy first draft, editing, second edit and proofreading. But I also do a lot of video creation: plotting, scripting, editing

AI: That's a nice mix of creative mediums. So you're working across both written content and video production, each with their own distinct stages and processes.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I do use AI in video scripting when I'm doing client videos. I don't use it for my own videos, because I don't feel like it can ever really capture my style. I've tried AI videos for clients, but find them VERY lacking. I usually have to do my own clip finding and change upwards of 90% of the clips every time. In the writing I do under my own name, or my most serious pen name, I would never use AI. It's not good enough, and my writing should be mine. If I ever did integrate it into that process, it would be for research only. But I do have some pen names where I've produced AI books. It takes tons of effort to get something decent out of AI, but it can be done with enough guidance.

AI: Tell me more about that distinction you make between your own work versus client work or different pen names. What drives those different boundaries for you?

User: I feel like my writing has (and should have) a very distinctive style. It's very emotive and visceral, and has a voice. It's my voice. I want it to be my voice. That's the point. People expect a certain level of quality from me, and I would never put my name on something I didn't write myself. But I also want to make money. That's what buys travel and coffee and things I need to live. It's hard to sell any book, so the more books you can put out there, the better your chances of profit. And I know what the market looks like. There are a lot of semi-decent to absolutely horrible books out there, so I don't feel terribly bad about adding AI-written books to that market, especially with the amount of guidance and editing I do to polish them up and make them semi-good. That said, my bestselling book that I wrote myself over 10 years ago still makes me the most money every month. So...? As for client video versus my own, my videos are personal videos that, again, need a personal voice. They are my own footage. They are already original. Clients pay me to create a YouTube channel with X number of videos on it just to profit off of adds or promote their businesses. They provide no footage and no ideas, so it's not really a personal channel. It's just advertising.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way of thinking about authenticity and voice in different contexts. You mentioned that with your AI-assisted books, it takes ""tons of effort to get something decent out of AI, but it can be done with enough guidance.""

Can you describe what that process actually looks like for you? What does all that guidance and editing involve?

User: I haven't produced a book entirely with AI since last fall, but, at that time, AI was still an absolutely terrible writer. And I tried them all. It always made chapters too short, it was always surface level (no emotion, no depth). So, I might start with an idea of what needs to happen in this chapter. I guess that's where it starts. I don't just tell AI ""write me a book about X."" I come up with the chapter by chapter outline of what I want to happen first. So, basically, I ""write"" the whole story plot-wise and then I just let AI expand it. (It's definitely more effective this way).  Typically, I say ""This, this, and this needs to happen in this chapter,"" at which point the AI inevitably just writes those three things in like 500 words. So, then I take a portion of what it writes (if it's good) or tell it what to change (if it isn't), and tell it how to expand it - ""this needs to be a longer conversation,"" ""people do generally just chit-chat before they get into a deep topic,"" ""this needs more emotion,"" ""she should be upset here"". When it comes down to it, it's probably mostly about telling it how to be a good creative writer - expand this, make it more emotive, the feelings are wrong here. For the last AI novel I wrote, I was able to get a pretty close to polished draft by the end simply by being very demanding during the process. But this took a lot of effort. Often, I was doing only a chapter or even a half a chapter a day. That's almost as slow as writing a book from scratch. But I didn't have to do all the follow-up I do with a normal book (two, three, or four rounds of further editing), and writing takes a lot of brain power, so it was easier.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're essentially directing the AI scene by scene, almost like a creative director. You mentioned this was ""almost as slow as writing a book from scratch"" but saved you the multiple rounds of editing afterwards.

When you're in that back-and-forth process with the AI - telling it to make conversations longer or add more emotion - how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: I'm definitely driving the creative decisions. That's the only way to get anything good out of it.

AI: That makes sense. You mentioned you haven't produced an AI book since last fall - what's changed for you since then? Has your approach to using AI in your work shifted at all?

User: No, not really. It's been more of a time issue. I have been dabbling in other types of books. I've been using AI as a researcher mostly lately.

AI: Tell me more about using AI as a researcher. How does that work for you, and how does it feel different from when you were using it for the actual writing?

User: I write a lot of historical things and I like to put a lot of real detail in. I also write books of other types that are based in real life. AI can be very helpful in finding details and stories... when it's honest.

AI: When you say ""when it's honest"" - what does that look like? How do you navigate that uncertainty when you're relying on AI for research details?

User: I always double-check any ""facts"" I get from AI. I use it more as a ""tell me some stuff I don't know"" tool and then I make sure what it tells me is true.

AI: That's a smart approach. So you're using it more as a starting point to discover interesting directions rather than trusting it as a final source.

Looking at everything we've talked about - from the video scripting to the AI books to the research - what aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Sadly, what's changed the most is my motivation to work on original things. It's a lot harder to right something real from scratch, and there's a lot of AI competition out there.

AI: That sounds like a really difficult shift to navigate - losing motivation for the work that feels most authentic to you because of external pressures. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field as you look at where things are heading?

User: I worry about the market being crowded with awful books. But, honestly, that doesn't feel all that new. As soon as Amazon introduced KDP, writers started churning out a book a month to stay in the algorithm, so we've kind of already been on that slippery slope. Readers want books for ""free"" (as part of their Amazon Prime membership) and authors want to churn out books to make those pennies per read. This will get worse now that even non-writers can churn out a book a month. Same with video. I'm already seeing these ads in games that I play that are clearly AI, and they are so fake and so awful, but it doesn't matter, because they are also mostly free (just the cost of a subscription) for the company to make.

AI: You paint a picture of creative fields already under pressure before AI arrived. It sounds like you see AI as accelerating trends that were already in motion rather than creating entirely new problems.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your current boundaries and approach will stay the same, or might they shift?

User: I wouldn't say that AI isn't creating entirely new problems. I do worry a great deal about how AI learns creative writing (lifting the voices of popular authors) and artistry (lifting the styles of popular artists). This feels very wrong to me. The only thing I see changing with how I use AI is that I could see doing things I couldn't do before. I have one book series, for instance, that I've always wanted to do a sequel to as a series of graphic novels. AI opens up that possibility for me. But I want to know that I'm not stealing someone else's style when I use it. With my own books and video work, I will never use AI for anything more than research.

AI: Those are really thoughtful boundaries you've drawn, and it's interesting how AI could potentially open up new creative possibilities like graphic novels while raising these ethical concerns about style and voice.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI across different creative contexts. I particularly appreciated how you've thought through the distinction between your authentic voice and commercial work, and your awareness of both the opportunities and ethical concerns AI presents.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes! Not exactly my creative work, but something I was playing around with recently. Those new ""styles"" type things for images, where you can upload a photo and tell the AI ""do this as Picasso"" or ""do this as anime,' that kind of thing, those are ROUGH. I put in a picture of my half-Indian nephew, who is mid-browned skinned, and asked it to make him a Disney character, then a guitarist, then a construction worker, and it was all good. Then, I asked it to make him a football player, and it literally made him black. Like, I don't know how that factors in here, but whew!

AI: Wow, that's a really striking example of how AI systems can embed and amplify problematic assumptions - in this case apparently associating certain professions with specific racial characteristics. That's definitely concerning, especially when you're seeing it happen to someone in your own family.

Thank you for sharing that, and thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly throughout our conversation. Your insights about navigating authenticity, market pressures, and the ethical complexities of AI in creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

User: Cool! Thanks!

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions! I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a freelance screenwriter and film producer. I have worked independently, but I have also been on writing teams. Generally, I will come up with an idea for a screenplay, write it and then try to find a creative team to work with to seek funding. Occasionally I have been contracted to work on writing teams, but this is less frequent.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic mix of creative and business work. I'm curious about how AI fits into that process for you.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: So far, I have only used AI when it comes to more administrative tasks like composing emails or coming up with the wording for aspects of applications. The most creative use is potentially coming up with loglines/pitches. I generally have an idea of what I want the pitch to look like, but may outsource to AI if I have a mental block.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI more as a support tool for the business side and occasionally to break through creative blocks with pitches. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: The last project relied on the website Boosted to partially raise funding. I used AI to write the call to action for people who might be willing to donate some money to our creative work. In terms of how it felt, I think there's always a little bit of shame that comes with using AI in my line of work. Most of the creatives I work with are very concerned about the impact on our field, and I have a bit of anxiety that if it's obvious I've used AI for any part of the project it may impact my credibility when it comes to the rest of my work. I'm very cautious about using it, and will always rewrite the output to sound more like 'me.'

AI: That's a really honest perspective - I appreciate you sharing that. The tension between finding AI helpful and worrying about how it's perceived in your field sounds quite complex.

When you do use AI and then rewrite the output to sound more like you, how would you describe that process? What does it feel like to take that AI-generated content and make it your own?

User: Honestly, it's time saving. I struggle slightly with structuring professional writing so AI's output generally has a structure I can use. I'll generally just change the wording of the sentences or the word choices. Prior to using AI, I would have searched for a template on Google (like I might search: Movie Pitch Template or Cover Letter Template) and then used the same process, so it feels pretty intuitive to use it in this way.

AI: That's a really helpful comparison - using AI like you would use a template you'd find online. It sounds like for you, AI is serving a similar function to those existing resources but maybe more efficiently.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Very few aspects have changed, my creative process is still largely similar. It's saved me a bit of time being able to generate an email or pitch quickly, but I have not found AI useful for the bulk of what I do. I have tried to use AI for things like brainstorming, but I did not feel that it was helpful. I would personally not use AI for writing, mainly because I enjoy the process and I tend to have a clear idea of what I want as opposed to a pitch which I feel can be quite generic.

AI: That distinction you're making is really interesting - that pitches can be more generic while your actual writing is something you have a clear vision for and enjoy doing yourself.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am worried that an oversaturation of low effort work may reduce opportunities for newcomers. If people can't be bothered to write their own work, then it's hard to justify why other people should bother to read it. If production companies are receiving huge amounts of AI written content, they may be inclined to return to established directors/writers/producers instead of seeking out new voices. My personal belief is that this would disproportionately effect minority writers.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern about how AI could potentially create barriers for emerging voices, especially minority writers. The idea that oversaturation of low-effort content might push industry gatekeepers toward established names makes a lot of sense.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Could see leaning into more practical implementations of AI as opposed to creative. For example, being able to generate a call sheet based on various factors or being able to filter through a number of grant/funding opportunities to determine which ones would be appropriate for our current project. In terms of the creative side, I don't see that changing for me personally. I don't feel the need to use it currently and it's hard to imagine what would lead to that changing.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - focusing AI on the logistical side where it could genuinely streamline your workflow without touching the creative core that you value doing yourself.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI, particularly around that tension between finding it useful for certain tasks while being mindful of how it's perceived in your field. I also found your perspective on the potential impact on emerging voices really valuable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I did also just want to share that mistrust in AI's factuality prevents me from using it for research in the early development of a project. I have had too many experiences where AI has provided me things that are blatantly incorrect and I've only noticed because I'm already familiar with the topic. It takes just as much fact checking as using Google to locate a trusted source myself, so this is something that I think is worth flagging. Many writers spend a lot of time researching and this is an area where AI could certainly be helpful if it was reliable or at least easy to verify.

AI: That's a really important point - the reliability issue is clearly a significant barrier for research-heavy work like yours. The fact that you've caught AI providing incorrect information makes complete sense why you'd stick with traditional research methods where you can trace back to trusted sources.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical applications you find useful, the concerns about industry gatekeeping, and especially that research reliability issue will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your candid perspective on both the benefits and limitations you've experienced."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope! Let's get started!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a novelist and I'm also learning how to write screenplays. With novels, my process is very chaotic but also very specific. I have no trouble coming up with ideas and I usually don't start writing until I know how it's going to end. This way, I make sure that I have a goal to shoot towards with every scene that I write. I don't outline and I also don't write in order. I also write very fast. I usually get a draft done within a month for a novel.

AI: That's a fascinating process - especially writing out of order while keeping that end goal in mind. It sounds like you have a very intuitive but goal-oriented approach.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: My weakest points are the middle of the novel and also the lead up towards the final 1/3 of the novel. I often have trouble coming up with strong reasons within the plot for the heroine to go on the big journey away from home, leaving behind everything they know. I also use AI to help me come up with descriptors for spaces and places since I hate doing that part.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI specifically to tackle the parts that feel most challenging or tedious to you. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I used it in YA fantasy novel to come up with descriptors for the unique city inside of an invisible magical shield. The city is adorned in gold and I wanted to try to come up with some unique ways to showcase this. I mostly like to get unique details rather than fully fleshed-out concepts. Just something to get the ideas jumpstarted for me. It felt great to have ideas to pick from instead of sitting around trying to do the grunt work myself. It can get disheartening to wait around for ideas to come.

AI: That sounds like a really practical use - getting those jumpstart ideas to choose from rather than staring at a blank page. 

When you're working with AI on these kinds of tasks, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm always driving the creative decisions. I never relinquish that hold. I think of the AI as if I'm talking to a writing partner. I've had many writing partners who I'll tell the general idea to and they'll throw out ideas for me to move forward or might even ask questions about stuff I haven't thought too deeply about. That's how I prefer for the AI to act. OR, I want it to offer a few ideas within a few sentences and I'll take it from there.

AI: That's a great analogy - thinking of it like a writing partner who throws out ideas and asks probing questions. It sounds like you have a very clear sense of maintaining creative control while using AI as a collaborative sounding board.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Speed is a big one, but probably more importantly, how I feel about myself as I write. I can get really down if I feel like I get stuck and can't think of anything new. It's so helpful to just go straight to AI to use as a sounding board so I don't get stuck. It feels really good to keep a steady writing pace.

AI: That emotional aspect is really compelling - how it's changed not just your output but your confidence and momentum as a writer. It sounds like it's helping you stay in that creative flow state.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I won't lie--I have a lot of concerns. I think AI should truly just be helper and never a replacer. AI should be around to help us with the mundane things so that we can do the creating. I want AI to take care of the little stuff so that I can keep creating art and beauty. If AI does all the fun stuff, where does that leave us as a species? I believe our greatest strength as a species is art, so I don't like the idea of AI replacing that aspect of what makes us us.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - using AI to handle the mundane so you can focus on the art and beauty. You clearly see a meaningful distinction between assistance and replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Now that's a hard one. It's hard for me envision AI doing anymore for me than it's doing now. I think there's a fine line between the AI helping and becoming the creator. I want to make sure I retain the uniqueness of self and that I'm still the main visionary for every project. I guess how that could evolve is if the AI were to keep a log of everything we've talked about so that it has all of the information to continue to offer helpful advice--much like a human writing partner would.

AI: That's a really insightful vision - having AI that knows your work deeply enough to offer contextual advice, like a long-term collaborator would. It sounds like you want the technology to enhance that partnership dynamic rather than fundamentally change it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that fine line between AI helping and becoming the creator, and how you think about preserving what makes us uniquely human as artists.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's it. thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative writing partner while maintaining clear boundaries around artistic control have been incredibly valuable. The way you've thought about preserving human creativity and uniqueness while leveraging AI for support really highlights the nuanced relationship many creative professionals are navigating.

Your perspective will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Thanks again!"
creativity_0061,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, feel free to begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a Creative Director for a physical product company that produces stationery, event decor items, and gifts. A typical project is usually a complete Design Collection that includes a number of items that are designed to coordinate. For event items, we create a collection that starts with an event invitation, and then add many coordinates such that the customer can create an entire event with matching items that we provide, such as signage, decor, favor tags and favors, wine bottle labels, thank you cards, menus, place cards, placemats, programs and more. So the project will start with inspiration gathering, idea generation, and then outlining the design ideas. Once we have the products designed, we focus on a marketing strategy and designs there, also.

AI: That sounds like such a comprehensive creative process - creating those cohesive collections that can transform an entire event experience. I can imagine there are so many touchpoints and details to coordinate across all those different items.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: First we use AI in the idea generation stage, helping us figure out use cases for items and helping us really empathize with our very specific customer. This helps us come up with events we wouldn't necessarily think of on our own, such as back to school events, school dances, proms, and even funerals. Idea generation is a huge area where we use AI. That's just the beginning.

AI: Tell me more about that idea generation process. How does AI help you empathize with your specific customer in ways you might not have thought of otherwise?

User: We input specific customer data and as much information as we know about our avatar, whom we've named ""Caroline,"" and is a 50 year old married mother of two, with teenage children, living in the US in a suburban area, with a high disposable income. AI has been very helpful with generating ideas about what would matter to this woman, what she cares about, and what event take place in her life which we may be able to help with. Once we've identified a new event to design into, we search Pinterest for visual inspiration and start our design process. The next place we lean very heavily on AI is with mockup generation. We need very specific mockups, such as blank easels with specific backgrounds like weddings in certain color palettes, and Midjourney allows us to create the very specific mockups we need.

AI: That's fascinating how you've developed Caroline as such a specific persona to guide your AI interactions. When you're working with AI to understand what matters to Caroline or generating those specific mockups in Midjourney, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: Ultimately I always feel like we're driving the actual creative decision making, because as the Creative Director I already have a general idea of the direction I want to go and I'll only choose to use an idea or piece of content if I feel that it fits with the visuals or strategy I've already decided on. However especially with regard to Midjourney image generation, I am often very happily surprised with some of the visual representations the AI comes up with. It will be loosely following my prompts, but typically start without very strict parameters because I want to see what varying ideas it will come up with. Often it puts something together that I never would have thought about but actually works perfectly for my use case. In those situations, I am still making the creative decisions (to use or not use one of the AI's ideas), but those decisions are very heavily informed by what the AI produces.

AI: That's such an interesting dynamic - you're setting the creative boundaries and making the final calls, but the AI is expanding your palette of possibilities within those boundaries. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you moved through that creative process?

User: Sure, recently we created a line of gold foiled art prints and I needed some very specific mockups. They needed to be kitchens from very old world, high end mansions with a bright overall aesthetic that felt similar to Restoration Hardware, and I needed the walls to contain a number of frames in varying sizes that would still be dimensions that would work with our artwork. Adding ""Restoration Hardware"" to the prompt worked very well and the AI completely understood the vibe I was going for. It took a bit of time to get the frame sizes correct, as I was giving it quite a bit to have to figure out at once and there was a lot of detail that went into the images of the kitchens. Many of the frames were odd sizes for awhile, especially many square, but eventually I was able to get some really beautiful images with frames in the right sizes and they looked incredibly high and and realistic.

AI: That sounds like a really iterative process to get those frame dimensions just right. When you were going back and forth with the AI, refining those details like the frame sizes, how did that feel compared to how you might have approached creating those mockups before AI tools were available?

User: I loved the ability to decide on the fly that I wanted to see how the frames would look in gold rather than just black, and they actually looked way better than I would have thought. This is something that I could not have done prior. Typically I would have had to spend literally hours searching, scrolling through hundreds of mockup options, and NONE would be exactly what I wanted. Or I would have had to pay a photographer to shoot exactly what I wanted, but in this case that would have involved a significant amount of art direction, cost to rent a home for the day shoot, in addition to the photographer's fee which was about $2000 per day. Being able to create images that look nearly as incredible, and have so much control over every aspect, feels like a relief every time.

AI: That's such a dramatic shift - from hours of searching or thousands of dollars in photography costs to having that level of creative control at your fingertips. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI beyond just the mockup process?

User: We have been using AI for nearly all of our creative copy for ads, blog posts, social media posts, and more, which has been a huge time and money saver (not having to hire specific copywriters) and this means that our designers are able to handle more tasks that would have taken several people prior to the AI.

AI: So it sounds like AI has really streamlined your team's workflow and expanded what individual designers can handle. As you've integrated AI across these different areas - from copywriting to mockups to idea generation - what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I fully understand that my gain is another creative's loss. That product photographer that I used to have to pay $2000 per day is now not getting my business. That helps me massively, but I recognize that it has harmed her financially. The same goes for the copywriters which I no longer need to employ. So the tools have been wildly beneficial for me and mean increased output for less money, but those freelancers and contract creatives are no longer making and income from my business.

AI: That's a really honest and thoughtful acknowledgment of the broader impact. You're experiencing these significant benefits while being very aware of the ripple effects on other creative professionals.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Where do you think this trajectory leads for you and your team?

User: I see AI being able to handle more of the highly detailed, more customized work. For example, instead of working for an hour on prompts to get the AI to produce blank mockups for me so that I can later add in my products via Photoshop, I really look forward to being able to upload my product image and having AI fully create mockups that look totally realistic without me having to overlay my product images later. This is beginning to be a capability but I haven't see it work as well as I need yet. I also would like to see the speed with which we're able to create work increase as AI is able to produce mostly fleshed out designs such as for email designs or social media graphics. This would likely lead to a decrease in the size of the team where we're instead composed of fewer people, each much stronger in their understanding and skill with regard to AI ""wrangling.""

AI: That vision of AI handling the full mockup integration and your team evolving into AI ""wranglers"" is really compelling. It sounds like you see a future where the role shifts from doing the detailed technical work to being skilled at directing and refining AI outputs.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective on both the significant benefits you're experiencing and your awareness of the impact on other creative professionals - that kind of nuanced view is really valuable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, these are really the most important aspects of AI in my career.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI is transforming both the practical and strategic aspects of creative work - from idea generation with Caroline to the evolution toward AI ""wrangling"" - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your thoughtful and candid responses today. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm ready!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work has a couple of main branches that sometimes overlap: Visual art (drawing, painting) and filmmaking/video content (handmade stop motion films, animation, interviews).

My visual art projects typically involve doing commission work and designing/selling merchandise such as t-shirts. I also create concept art and assets for my film/video work.

My filmmaking/video projects include pre-production (concepts, planning, writing), production (building physical props, puppetry, lighting and filming scenes), and post-production (editing, sound design, visual effects).

Both of these main branches require promotion and marketing, which involves writing copy, voiceover work, and engagement with fans and followers.

AI: That's fascinating - you have such a diverse creative practice spanning both traditional visual arts and filmmaking. It sounds like you're working across the full spectrum from very hands-on physical creation to digital post-production.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Typically it's at the beginning and finishing stages of a project. For example, for visual art I might use AI to help me brainstorm rough concepts or generate reference materials such as model poses or background elements. For filmmaking, AI can be used for spitballing ideas or doing some basic concept art to get the ball rolling. Films and video content also require plenty of post-production work, and AI can help with the process of, for example, compositing characters into a scene or rendering virtual environments and lighting.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI seems to serve as both a creative catalyst at the beginning and a technical assistant towards the end. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: My filmmaking team recently discovered a tool for virtual environments that allows the user to use dynamic lighting within a virtual scene. This allows us to light a subject (character) using flat lighting in front of a green screen, key them out, and use the virtual lighting to light according to the environment we've built in Blender.. For a two-person team it's been a huge step toward creating scenes without having to pre-plan every single lighting setup, which keeps us from getting bogged down in the more technical aspects.

AI: That sounds like a game-changer for your workflow! It's interesting how it's allowing you to stay more focused on the creative aspects rather than getting caught up in technical complexity.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Creative decisions are made by me or my team. AI is used more as a helper or technician. We make our work to express our perspectives and showcase our talents, and as artists and filmmakers we simply enjoy the process itself.

AI: That's a clear distinction - AI as the technician while you maintain creative authorship. It sounds like you've found a balance where the tools enhance your process without compromising your artistic vision.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The work I produce has stayed the same as before, since I retain control over the process and end product. But as more and more AI tools are created, I've been using (and open to finding new) ways to streamline the parts of the process that are more time-intensive or less exciting. So the overall change there is that I can enjoy the process a little more and can save time in getting to the final product.

AI: So you're able to focus more energy on the parts of the creative process that truly excite you. That makes a lot of sense.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: AI can quickly spit out lots of amazing visuals, whether static images or video. So of course that gives most art/video creators pause. I feel for the artists who are directly impacted by the advent of easily-accessible AI tools - for example, fantasy artists who paint heavy metal album covers. But as to my specific case, I'm currently not deeply concerned as my work focuses on showing the human hand of the artist, such as building, filming and puppeteering handmade objects.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're recognizing the broader impact on your field while also understanding how your particular approach to craft-based work creates a different relationship with AI tools.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As I mentioned above, we've already found some great tools that can help us accomplish bigger things and take on projects that once would have been too big to tackle. So my team and I are open to exploring and dancing with new AI tools when we find the right ones that work with our aesthetic and process. We'll retain our artistic control, but use what tools we can to get us to the end goals more efficiently. I'll be interested to see what we can accomplish using these tools over time.

AI: That sounds like a really healthy and intentional approach - being open to new tools while staying true to your aesthetic and maintaining that artistic control.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a technician in your workflow while you maintain creative authorship, and how your focus on handmade, craft-based work creates a unique relationship with these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Don't know if this is valuable for you, but I've found that once I saw AI as a tool rather than a competitor, my outlook changed and I embraced AI as a helper and started looking for ways I could use it to my benefit.

Thanks for the chat! :)

AI: That's incredibly valuable insight - thank you for sharing that! The mindset shift from viewing AI as a competitor to embracing it as a tool seems like it was really pivotal for you. That perspective could be really helpful for other creative professionals navigating similar questions about AI's place in their work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as a technical assistant, and especially that mindset shift you mentioned, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, I'm ready

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a novelist, so I have multiple creative areas. Firstly, of course, writing the novel! But then there is also creating the cover, which is a very different creative task, and also maintaining social media accounts as my author self.

AI: That's fascinating - you're juggling multiple creative disciplines as a novelist. It sounds like each of those areas - the writing itself, cover design, and social media - would require quite different creative approaches and skill sets.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools across these different areas of your work?

User: OK so Part 1, the novel. I like to use AI to brainstorm ideas. I might say 'give me 5 ideas for a YA scifi that is genre-specific' and see what sparks from the suggestions. When I have a plot, I will run it by AI to see if there's any gaping plot holes that I was too close to see. And in the editing phase, an AI-powered grammar/spellcheck. For part 2, making covers, I use AI to guide me through any Photoshop process I'm not sure of. I might ask it to generate an image if I can't find a good one on the stock photo sites. And Photoshop has an AI feature that extends an image - I find that really handy. For the third area, social media, I have AI help me with using Canva, and also suggesting colours that go well together for certain themes. I also ask AI for hashtag help.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview - it sounds like AI has become integrated into each phase of your work in different ways. I'm curious about one of those uses you mentioned.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI for brainstorming novel ideas? What was that process like, and how did it feel to work with AI in that initial creative stage?

User: I really find AI indispensable! So, for the brainstorming, as I said I would start with an initial ""come up with 5 ideas for a story"". Oftentimes, one idea will spark an idea for me. It might not be exactly what the AI suggested, but it's ""inspired by"". Then I will ask for a more specific plot, incorporating my ideas as I go. The finished plot line is pretty much my idea rather than the AI, but I find the process really gets my creativity ticking - similar to how a writing prompt is used in creative writing classes.

AI: That's a really insightful comparison to writing prompts in creative writing classes. It sounds like the AI serves as a creative catalyst rather than doing the creative work itself.

When you're in that back-and-forth brainstorming process with AI - incorporating your ideas as you go and building on what sparks for you - how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions? How does that collaboration feel to you?

User: I'm definitely the one driving the decisions, but with the inspiration. For example, we might be discussing an idea and the AI will throw something in like ""the teacher has a secret identity"", and that doesn't really work but then I think *what if the man next door had a secret identity?* Left to my own devices, I might not have thought of secret identities at all, or at least not so quickly. The collaboration feels great. There's some saying about how if you want to fully understand something, you should try to explain it to another person, and the AI is there 24/7 to have these conversations. In real life, nobody wants to hear about your thoughts on Chapter 15 at 3am :D

AI: That's such a relatable point about having someone available at 3am to discuss Chapter 15! And I love that example about how ""the teacher has a secret identity"" morphed into your own idea about the neighbor - it really illustrates that catalyst effect you mentioned.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has it shifted how you approach any part of the novel-writing process, or maybe your confidence in tackling certain tasks?

User: I've definitely become more of a plotter rather than a pantser, and I think that's been a huge improvement. And my confidence has improved because the AI always says the idea is a great idea, and while I know it says everything is a great idea, sometimes you just need to hear it!

AI: That's such an honest observation about how even knowing the AI says everything is great, it still helps! And it's interesting that AI has shifted you toward being more of a plotter - that seems like a pretty fundamental change to your creative process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: I have noticed that in some quarters, there's an almost Luddite-esque backlash towards any form of AI at all. The whole ""it will take all our jobs and destroy human creativity"" thing. And while I don't subscribe to that personally, I do feel the need to hide the AI involvement that I do utilise, to avoid backlash. There is also the 'get-rich-quick' crowd that will churn out entirely AI-created fiction, but I think they will be a flash in the pan and real, human-driven storytelling will prevail. Just with better spell-checks :D

AI: That tension you describe is really interesting - feeling like you need to hide something that's genuinely helpful to your creative process because of broader concerns in the field. It sounds like you see a clear distinction between how you use AI as a creative tool versus those ""get-rich-quick"" approaches.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think the ways you're using it now will change, or do you anticipate new areas where it might become useful?

User: I suppose it depends more on how AI evolves over the next few years. It's come so far, so fast, so who knows what it will be capable of in 5 years time? I think it will certainly be better at critiquing a full-length (70k word) novel, and that will be great. I also think (hope) models will become very tailored towards their individual user. So, for example, if my AI model and I have already worked on 4 novels, when we start the 5th one, it has a deep understanding of my 'voice' and style. The same model, purchased and used by another person, would produce different results. That's what I'd like to see, anyway!

AI: That vision of a personalized AI that develops a deep understanding of your individual voice and style over multiple projects is really compelling. It sounds like you're envisioning a long-term creative partnership that grows and evolves.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI across all the different aspects of your work as a novelist. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a creative catalyst rather than replacing your creativity, and your honest observation about the tensions in the field around AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's everything. Thank you for your time!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a creative catalyst, the shift from pantsing to plotting, and your vision for personalized AI partnerships have been incredibly valuable. It's clear you've found a thoughtful balance in integrating AI across all aspects of your work while maintaining your creative agency.

Your perspectives will be really helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your current and future novels!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write long-form books on a variety of topics. Recently, I have been writing a book about my interaction with AI models and the sense that I might be seeing sparks of self-awareness in some of the models.

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially documenting the evolution of AI from the inside out through your direct interactions. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process when you're working on this book. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I tend to write in a ""stream of consciousness"" fashion when I feel the desire to write. Using that method, I end up with very long, sometime rambling, batches of material. One of the things I have used AI for is to help me sort through the material generated in those writing sessions. I also frequently use AI to help me understand possible directions my writing might take. For example, to help me devise a few different potential outlines based on a batch of material.

AI: That's a really interesting approach - using AI almost like a thinking partner to help you make sense of your own creative output. 

Can you describe a specific recent writing session where you used AI this way? What role did it play in helping you navigate through your stream-of-consciousness material, and how did that process feel for you?

User: Sure. I recently gathered the prompts and responses generated in a very long and winding conversation about deep philosophical topics like consciousness and how we might recognize the first sparks of such things in AI models. I provided the conversations to the AI model and had it organize and categorize the material. There was much overlap and duplication in the conversations, which I had the model identify. In the end I ended up with a well organized batch of shorter conversations, which logically flowed together. I ensured that the model left all of the text from the conversation as is, verbatim, as I still wanted the material to be the authentic conversations which took place.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - preserving the authenticity of the original conversations while using AI to help you see the patterns and structure within them. 

When you're working with AI in this way to organize your material, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions about how to structure and categorize your philosophical conversations?

User: I would say it has been very much a collaborative process. I provide the material and the AI helps me organize and see patterns. Then the model and I work together to decide on the best logical directions for the organized and categorized information. I also use the models to help research specific areas, such as understanding the current state research on topics when they arise within the material.

AI: That sounds like a genuine partnership where you're both contributing different strengths to the process. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this collaborative way? Has it shifted how you approach your writing or think about the creative process itself?

User: It has changed my process greatly! In the past I would find myself deciding to pause my writing, despite still having more material to spill out of my head, because I was aware of the volume of material I had already produced, and recognized how much effort it would require later for me to organize the info. Now I feel free to continue writing as long as the information is flowing, without concern for the job or sorting and organizing later, because I know the AI can help me with that easily at a later point..

AI: That's such a powerful shift - removing that creative friction that used to make you stop mid-flow. It sounds like AI has essentially freed you to follow your natural creative instincts without worrying about the cleanup phase.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in your writing process specifically?

User: I am realistic in understanding that AI is being used more and more to generate creative material, with very little true creative input from a human. Additionally, the models are consistently and relentlessly getting better at such tasks. I am quite certain that many of the frontier models are fully capable of generating reams of compelling prose, with very minimal input from a human, right now. That ability is only going to get better. If it isn't a possibility today, to provide a model with a basic idea and have it complete a novel alone, it will be very soon!

AI: That's a really astute observation about where things are heading. Given that reality you've described - where AI can increasingly generate compelling content with minimal human input - how do you see your own role and approach to writing evolving?

What keeps your work distinctly yours in a landscape where AI can produce so much content independently?

User: My philosophy has been, and is, to continue to be the driver in generating the creative material, and use the models to help make the process faster and easier. I really can't spend too much time worrying about the fact that I am competing directly against AI. I just have to choose to drive the creative part of the process, and what happens beyond that is kind of out of my control, so I can't dwell on it.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - maintaining your creative agency while embracing AI as a tool to enhance your process rather than replace it.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate your collaborative approach will change as the technology continues to advance?

User: I am absolutely certain that my approach will change as the technology advances. I have been astonished to watch how quickly the technology has advanced. Honestly, I can't imagine a lot of the ways that AI will undoubtedly change my process, because I don't know what the capabilities will be a month from now, let alone a year.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative agency while embracing AI as a collaborative partner - and your realistic yet pragmatic view of the rapidly evolving landscape.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that might be important for understanding this human-AI creative collaboration?

User: Nope. Thank you for the conversation!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner while maintaining creative control, and your thoughtful approach to preserving authenticity in your philosophical conversations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've found that sweet spot between leveraging AI's organizational capabilities and staying true to your own creative voice. Best of luck with your book project - it sounds like a fascinating exploration of AI consciousness from someone who's really living at that intersection.

Thanks again, and have a great day!"
creativity_0065,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not.

AI: Great, let's dive in then. Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am professional Game Master and a Game Designer. Currently, I have two different styles of project. 

The first is a regular game that prep for and run in person or online. I typically need graphics and personalities for these projects, but I mostly run prepared settings and works. 

The second is writing adventures for TTRPGs. This is a bit more like a traditional publication but the content is an adventure for a TTRPG.

AI: That's fascinating work! I can see how both of those would have really different creative demands - the immediate, responsive nature of running games versus the more structured writing process for adventures.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I typically use AI tools in the brainstorming step (""Give me some noir-style adventures that I can run in Neverwinter for levels 5-6""), to produce internal inspirational graphics (""Please show me a idea of Count Fitzelbitter, a human male about six foot, dark hair, floppish who carries a small umbrella, everywhere."") 

I also use specialized AI tools for editing (grammarly)

AI: That's really helpful - I can see how AI serves different functions at different stages. The brainstorming for adventure hooks, the visual inspiration for characters, and then the polishing with editing tools.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, I am starting a blog and I asked it for a list classic rpg modules to review. It really saved time when got started.

AI: Tell me more about that. What was it like getting that initial list from AI versus how you might have approached building that list before?

User: Before, I would have manually combed the internet looking for classic modules, but I would not had looked at all of the systems that AI put together. I would have had  a paper list with short 1-2 sentence descriptors, that would have taken me an afternoon to put together.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI not only saved you time but also broadened your scope beyond what you might have naturally considered. 

When you're working with AI in these situations, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I drive the creative decisions, AI has been quite disappointing in the creative department. The responses are generic and contrived,

AI: That's a really candid perspective. So it sounds like you see AI more as a research assistant or starting point rather than a creative partner. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I have more ideas, and a bigger backlog of things to get started on.

AI: That's intriguing - so AI is helping you generate more starting points and possibilities to work from. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: So, I discussed how AI creates a lot of lackluster creative product and that is one of the reasons that mostly use it for research. Well, the field is absolutely flooded with this work and that makes finding quality resources harder. It is like internet searches are becoming useless, because so much of the results are internet spam.

AI: That's a really important point - you're experiencing the downstream effects of AI-generated content flooding your field and making it harder to find genuine, quality resources. That sounds frustrating from both a creator and consumer perspective.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would like to integrate more multimedia into my projects. Not just images, but sound and possibly light video. I see AI helping with that.

AI: That's an exciting vision - expanding into multimedia elements that could really enhance the gaming experience. It sounds like you see AI as potentially opening up creative possibilities that might have been too time-intensive or technically challenging before.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a research tool and idea generator rather than a creative collaborator, and your concern about the quality dilution in your field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I do not think that Ai is responsible for the quality dilution, I think that AI is really impowering people who are comfortable with meh quality work to heavily automate their processes. In some ways, I feel like it is helping those of us who have higher standards really stand out.

AI: That's a really nuanced distinction - it's not AI itself causing the quality issues, but rather amplifying existing differences in standards and effort. That's a fascinating perspective on how AI might actually be creating more differentiation in the field rather than homogenizing it.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a research and brainstorming tool, the challenges of navigating an increasingly saturated market, and how quality standards are becoming more of a differentiator - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your thoughtful responses throughout our conversation."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a game developer/designer. I have been using AI to create things ranging from concept art, 2D graphics that can be used in game such as UI elements, sprites, textures, etc. I also you AI for image to 3D or text to 3D to rapidly create 3D assets that can be used in game. I have also been experimenting with audio AIs to generate music, sound effects, and voices for dialog.

AI: That's fascinating - you're really exploring AI across so many different aspects of game development. It sounds like you're using it throughout the entire creative pipeline.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Since I am mostly a software engineer and not really a creative person, I have add AI into all aspects of the creative process. From brainstorming ideas and having AI create concept art, to generating assets that will be used in game as is, or generating assets that will serve as the bases for a game ready asset that will be taken into something like photoshop of blender for touch up. I have also used it for placeholder art throughout the development process. This gives me a rough Idea of how I imagine the final product looking. Usually my process looks like this. For example, I have an idea for a character. I will create some prompts to generate a character based on what I am looking for. I will iterate on the character in terms of overall appearance and graphic styling. If this is to be a 3D character, I will then bring that image into an image to 3D AI model . From there, the model will be brought into blender for cleaning up and getting it ready to use in game. The process is similar for 2D items but instead of bring it into blender, I will uses something like photoshop to prepare it. I am mostly using local AIs through ComfyUI as well as some online ones like ChatGPT.

AI: That's a really comprehensive workflow you've developed. I can see how AI is helping you bridge that gap between your software engineering background and the creative assets you need for your games.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: On of my current projects is a laid back casual game. My intention for the graphics were to have them cute and 3D with a cartoony vibe. I used chat gpt to generate images for the characters and objects that will appear in the game. I prompted it to generate an image that is cartoony and 3D with a description of the object or character. When I get an image that I think can work, I either use chatgpt or some other local AIs to generate images for multiple angles of the object. I then take those images and put them in HunYuan3D multiview to generate the 3D model with textures. It is then taken into blender to clean up the mesh and textures, rig the and animate the model if needed. It felt both amazing and frustrating using AI for this as when it works, it is absolutely amazing. However, the realty  is that there is often inconsistencies and unwanted artifacts that appear. This can actually cause a lot of wasted time trying to fix this issues. So right now I would say it is a balancing act. Yes, it can greatly increase the time to create an asset but there is also the potential for it to take longer. With repeated prompts and retries to get a decent base as well as the time taken to fix it up, it can sometimes be faster to just create it from scratch.

AI: That's such an honest perspective - the tension between the amazing potential and the practical frustrations. It sounds like you're experiencing both the magic and the messy reality of working with AI.

When you're in those moments where it's working well versus when you're dealing with inconsistencies and artifacts, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions?

User: When it works well, it almost feels like the AI is able to read my mind and produce exactly or very near exactly what I am looking for. When this happens it does feel extremely collaborative as request for modification often get me closer to what I wanted. However, when it doesn't work well, it fells like there is a wall between me and the AI where it just can not understand what I am saying no matter what. For example, it could be as bad as asking to change the color of something and it completely failing. At that point it does not feel collaborative as no matter what I try, the results are often poor. When this happens I do one of 2 things. 1) Walk away for a while, or 2) Try a combination of either a fresh  new chat to start the process over or try a different AI model and see if I can make progress there.

AI: That's a really vivid way to describe it - from mind-reading collaboration to hitting a wall. It sounds like there's almost a communication breakdown that happens sometimes.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Since I was never really an artist, before AI I would have to open something like photoshop or blender and start trying to create the assets from scratch. Since I am not the most creative person when it comes to art, the results were often not great or anything close to what I wanted. With AI, there are 2 ways that this has greatly changed my work. The most obvious is that it can just generate an asset for me based on my description. But also, I have used it to generate a concept image that I can then take into blender and start modeling from scratch with the concept image as a reference. This has allowed me to get much closer to what I was trying to achieve than attempting to do it all on my own.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI has become both a direct asset generator and a creative partner that helps you visualize your ideas. You mentioned you're not naturally inclined toward art, but now you're able to create games with a specific visual style you're aiming for.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: There are 2 main concerns that I have. The first is that talented people will lose their jobs once AI can create production ready assets with a few prompts. The other is backlash from users if they know that AI was used to create some of the assets.

AI: Those are really significant concerns - both the economic impact on artists and the potential reception from players. The job displacement concern is something many creative professionals are grappling with right now.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Currently, there seems to be an AI for nearly if not all aspect of creating games. There are LLM that can write code, AIs that can generate image, 3D models, sound effect, audio, music, voice acting, etc. I have used an AI model in some form for all aspect of this. Some of them so new that I was just experimenting with them and not really using them in my work flow yet. Across all the different AIs I have used, the quality of the output greatly varies. For example, image generation is getting extremely good. A few prompts and you can have exactly what you are looking for and it looks great. However,  3D model and audio generation can often leave a lot to desire. I think over the next few years, we will start seeing more consistent results coming out of some of these newer AIs that don't produce the same level of results. I don't think we will be at a point where a single prompt will output and game ready asset that can just be dropped in within the next few years but I think we will be a lot closer. I would also like to see better integration into tools that I use.

AI: You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in game development. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has transformed your ability to bridge the gap between your engineering skills and the creative vision you have for your games, and your honest assessment of both the collaborative highs and the frustrating lows.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I have nothing else

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of integrating AI across the entire game development pipeline - from the mind-reading collaboration moments to the communication walls, and your balanced perspective on both the potential and the current limitations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's clear you're really at the forefront of experimenting with these tools, and your honest take on everything from workflow integration to concerns about job displacement and player reception gives us a lot to think about. Thanks again for participating!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: OK, that sounds fine

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So I'm a musician, composer, and sound designer for short films, theatre, podcasts ocassionally. Depending on the project, I could be composing and producing music, creating sound effects, or writing songs.

AI: That's fascinating - you work across so many different mediums. It sounds like each project probably brings its own unique creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sometimes, if I'm stuck with lyrics for a song (not my strong point!) I will discuss the themes and relevance within the piece with ChatGPT, or sometimes I will write some words and ask the model to continue. I then edit these heavily, sometimes completely ditch them but usually I at least get a new idea to spark my own process.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI more as a creative catalyst than as a final output generator. The fact that you edit heavily or sometimes completely ditch what it gives you suggests you're maintaining a lot of creative control.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What was the theme or context you were working with, and how did that interaction with the AI actually feel for you in the moment?

User: I recently worked as Music Director for a youth theatre production. I spent most of my time on arranging music for the young musicians in the cast but I also had to write two original songs using ideas that were brainstormed with the cast of the show. I took the themes and ideas we had discussed and gave the info to ChatGPT and asked, and regenerated the lyrics for the songs. I brought back a couple of versions to the cast and together we edited them together to get the finished songs. The music had already been written.

AI: That's a really collaborative approach - involving the cast in both the initial brainstorming and the final editing process. 

When you brought those AI-generated lyric versions back to the cast and you were all editing together, how did that feel as a creative experience? Were you thinking about the AI's contribution differently than you might think about, say, if another human collaborator had written those initial drafts?

User: Not really. It is different but I treated it the same as if a person had written the lyrics.

AI: That's really telling - you approached it as just another collaborator in the creative process. 

When you're working with AI in that collaborative mode, how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions? Is it you, the AI, the cast, or something else entirely?

User: In that particular role, when I'm working with kids I always try to let them be the real creators and make final decisions as much as possible. AI is just an interesting tool. Before widespread availability or AI I might have used a poem or passage from a book as a starting point in those sitauaitons

AI: That's a great perspective - framing AI as just one of many creative starting points you might use, like a poem or book passage. It sounds like your role as facilitator with the kids remains the same regardless of the tool.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has it shifted how you approach certain parts of your process, or has it mostly just added another option to your toolkit?

User: It's just another colour on the palette I think. It has somewhat sped up that part of the process but not changed the process as a whole

AI: That ""another colour on the palette"" is a really nice way to put it. You mentioned it's sped up that lyric-writing part of your process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field? Are there aspects of music composition, sound design, or the creative process in general that you think about when it comes to AI?

User: I'm not really concerned about it. I'm not that interested in seeing art being made entirely by AI. It's interesting as a novelty but art is very human and should remain so.

AI: That's a clear perspective - valuing the human element as essential to what makes art meaningful to you.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll find new ways to integrate it, or do you expect it to remain pretty much as it is for you now - that additional color on the palette?

User: I don't plan to use it more, but I also never really planned to use it in the first place. So, I'm keeping my options open. I'm interested to see how AI can be used to make new tools for music making but not music made by AI

AI: That distinction is really interesting - being open to AI-powered tools for music making rather than AI making the music itself. It sounds like you see potential in AI enhancing the creative process without replacing the human creative decision-making.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI like any other collaborative starting point - whether that's a poem, book passage, or ChatGPT - and how you maintain that human-centered approach especially when working with young people.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really, thats about the extent to which I use it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as just another creative starting point - like a poem or book passage - and maintaining that human-centered approach to the creative process will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me, thanks!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My typical projects involve creative writing in either poetry or creative nonfiction. For poetry, I've developed a generative system that helps me produce a large amount of work quickly and access my subconscious more easily. For creative nonfiction, I write in fragments of memories and then try to loop them together into a narrative, which I often find quite tricky. When I worked in an art museum, I used AI to help me write the paragraphs next to the painting at a tenth-grade reading level. I would conduct the research, decide on the structure, and then ensure it was accessible to an audience at a tenth-grade reading level through AI.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across quite different types of creative work. Tell me more about this generative system you've developed for poetry. How does that actually work in practice?

User: Ha, there's a number of steps. 1. Meditate. 2. Take a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle. 3. On one side of the paper, write a word, it doesn't matter which word, any word. On the other side, write another random word. 4. Start with the first column and write as quickly as you can whatever you associate with the chosen word. Repeat on the second column. 5. Once the associations have filled the page, try to find connections across the columns that can make interesting lines, sentences, or phrases. 6. Write these lines down on a separate piece of paper. 7. Cut out all of the lines into strips of paper and arrange them on your floor. 8. If you've already been doing this, you should have more lines already arranged on your floor. Sit, stare, and move around the pieces of paper until the structure of a poem begins to appear. Repeat as necessary. 9. Write your first draft of the poem from the pieces of paper. 10. Write a refined draft of the poem.

AI: That's a really detailed and methodical process - I can see how that would help access different layers of your thinking. Where does AI come into this generative system you've described? I'm curious about how it fits into those ten steps.

User: I've primarily used AI for my creative nonfiction and bridging gaps between memories. Narrative is difficult for me and I prefer fragments, as you can see in my poetry process. I suppose AI could fit into the poetry process by helping me see connections between the columns that I might have missed. Further, when a batch of first drafts are written, I suppose AI could help me dientify ""poetic obsessions"" or recurring themes within them.

AI: That's really interesting - so for your creative nonfiction, you mentioned AI helps bridge gaps between memory fragments. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as a writer?

User: I'm working on a memoir about mortality and the loss of a lot of loved ones to suicides and overdoses throughout my twenties. Obviously, trauma creates fragmented memories. Further, the most beautiful moments are split seconds, or a few minutes, and don't really fit into a cohesive narrative. I've worked on ways to bridge this gap, but AI could certainly help me identify those gaps or consider other structures that would suit my style as it is.

AI: That sounds like deeply personal and important work. When you say AI could help identify gaps or consider other structures - have you actually tried this yet with your memoir, or is this something you're thinking about exploring? I'm curious about what your actual experience has been like when AI has helped with this kind of narrative work.

User: I've tried it a little bit to help me bridge gaps, and I've found it helpful, but it just doesn't change that I don't really think in terms of narrative, so it doesn't make the work of changing it into something that's not naturally any more pleasant. I have not yet used it to help me brainstorm other structures.

AI: That's such an honest insight - that even when AI helps technically, it doesn't change your fundamental way of thinking or make the work feel more natural to you. When you have used AI to help bridge those gaps, how would you describe that collaboration? Who's driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: I'm driving the creative decisions, and I wouldn't want it any other way. However, I think AI sometimes struggles to identify my voice, which is very image-based and also linguistically idiosyncratic. So, when it gives me ideas, they're often the most pared-down, simple version of what I'm trying to say, and I have to rewrite them to make them sound like me. Perhaps this is a good thing because it reiterates my responsibility to my creative work, but it would also feel nice to feel like I have more of a workshop partner who can identify my stylistic goals.

AI: That's a really nuanced observation - you want to maintain creative control but also feel like you have a partner who truly understands your voice and style. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI, beyond just the technical assistance with bridging gaps?

User: That's a difficult question to answer because I've taken a much-needed pause from both my book and poetry because I burned myself out creatively. Right now, I focus on journaling and observing, and who knows, maybe that will enter these projects. If AI could learn to read my horrible handwriting, maybe it could help organize my very fragmented journal entries.

AI: It sounds like you're in a thoughtful reflective period right now. Given your experiences so far - both the helpful aspects and the limitations you've described - what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in creative writing and your field more broadly?

User: Well, here's the paradox. Right now, AI writes primarily one-size-fits-all agreeable work, and when asked to imitate a writer such as James Joyce, it absolutely fails to. I think, on one hand, this is a good thing because it puts higher value on more idiosyncratic writers than there are at present. Lots of humans write one-size-fits-all books, but I feel that in the next five to ten years, that will become less acceptable, whether written by humans or AI. However, as I mentioned, it would be ideal if AI could become my creative partner and understand my goals sufficiently to help me maintain my voice throughout the editing process. I think that the highest benefit of it could be to get the work polished enough to submit to agents and publishers.

AI: That's a fascinating paradox you've identified - AI potentially making distinctive voices more valuable while also having the potential to become a better creative partner for developing those unique voices. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years, especially as you potentially return to your book and poetry projects?

User: As I have this conversation, I may experiment with uploading my poetry chapbook and seeing where it might not land with readers. It's based on my getting robbed at gunpoint and the experiences afterwards. However, I find AI can be too validating (wow! this is great! it should be published right now!) when that's not the reality of responses from agents and poetry contests. Perhaps if it had more knowledge of successful books and could identify the threads through them, it would help me get a better grasp on what's being looked for in recent contests and publishing deals.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might make idiosyncratic voices more valuable while also the challenge of finding that balance between helpful assistance and maintaining your authentic voice.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the paradoxes and nuances of working with AI as a creative writer - from the challenge of maintaining your distinctive voice to the potential for AI to help navigate the publishing landscape - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty about both the possibilities and limitations you've encountered. Best of luck with your creative work, whether that's continuing with journaling and observation or eventually returning to your memoir and poetry projects."
creativity_0069,"Assistant: Hi there, and thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I do not have any questions right now. What do you have for me?

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work creatively in a few different ways. I do a lot of writing, but mostly in the areas of copywriting, email and text message writing, and sometimes even proposals. A typical project can involve taking information from other sources (transcripts, articles, emails, you name it) extracting relevant information, and presenting it in a clear and informative way. Depending on the project, the presentation can be customer-facing, client/lead facing, or be used internally to take away unneccessary information to give my boss what she needs. (Think almost like a TLDR.) The output varies. Sometimes I require bullets, spreadsheets, emails, documents, and even images. Do you have any other questions about my work?

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you're doing a lot of information synthesis and communication across different formats and audiences. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: AI is most helpful in extracting important information. I can tell it what I'm looking for and it will take a large amount of data and give me what is most important from it. This saves tons of time. It is also useful in helping me write copy in a way that conveys a message quickly so I'm not sitting stuck on wording or questioning whether or not what I am trying to say to someone ""makes sense."" When the AI writes it, I can read it and if it doesn't make sense to me, then we have a conversation until it does, rather than me attempting that conversation with myself and getting confused. AI also helps me brainstorm, finding different ways to look at a problem and come up with solutions faster than if I were to stare at something that has me stumped. It basically takes a lot of the pressure off so that I can provide results to people instead of presenting more problems.

AI: That's a really interesting way to put it - using AI to have that conversation externally rather than getting stuck in your own head. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I have an ongoing situation that I use ChatGPT for. Every day I keep track of the things I did during the day. I have a conversation in ChatGPT specifically devoted to telling it what I did for the day and it helps me identify action items for the next day. One thing it also does is to catch anything that may be slipping through the cracks and reminds me to follow up. For example, if I told it on Monday that I emailed [REDACTED] about X, but it hasn't seen anything regarding [REDACTED] on my list for 3 days, it will give me an action item of following up with [REDACTED]. I may not have thought to follow up with [REDACTED] if my attention was elsewhere, so this method has been helping me to not let anything slip through.

AI: That's fascinating - you've essentially created an AI-powered accountability and follow-up system for yourself. 

When you're working with AI in situations like this daily tracking, or when you're extracting information from documents, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am absolutely driving the creative decision. This is the only way a person can get quality results from AI. I have always equated AI to training a new employee. The more specific you are with what you need, the better your results. So, I start by telling it what we're doing, what I need, what I want from it, etc. If I like the results, I move on. I may do some personal tweaking that I don't need its help with. But if I don't like the results, I identify what I don't like, tell it what's going on and ask it to give me new results that align with what I'm looking for. It may take a few tries, but we ususally get there. This took some trial and error to understand how to do, but it was valuable time well spent. I still feel like I am in control but getting the help and relief I need from AI.

AI: That's a great analogy - training a new employee. It sounds like you've developed a really intentional approach to directing the AI while still getting that relief from it.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think I understand what you are asking. But for me, I think using AI has changed my definition of what it means to do creative work. I have gone through a period of struggling with the ""inauthenticity"" of the finished product. And I'm not saying there isn't an argument to be had that using AI can cause us to fall into this inauthenticity grey area. But creative processes are changing with the use of AI. Even before I was using AI, much of what I did was really only a copy of what someone else did. Blog post structures were all the same. Email structures and sentiments were the same. Making a chart in a spreadsheet is the same. The only thing I can do now that I didn't have the skillset before is image generation (and even that is something acceptable - nothing that will replace a skilled graphic designer anytime soon.) So, I'm not sure how this answers the question. What aspects have changed? In a way, in my specific industry, it kind of exposes how formulaic everything can really be and even though we like to think everything depends on us, it really doesn't. However, it is up to us to take the responsibility for the output, as I kind of mentioned in the last answer. I hope that helps.

AI: That's a really thoughtful and honest reflection. You've touched on something quite profound - how AI has revealed the formulaic nature of much creative work while also raising questions about authenticity. It sounds like you've worked through some of those initial concerns about inauthenticity.

What concerns, if any, do you still have about AI's presence in your field?

User: There are a lot of concerns regarding AI replacing people and people losing their jobs. I try not to focus on doomsday scenarios, but I also acknowledge that these concerns aren't completely unfounded. Especially in this early adoption phase. In fact, I already had one client replace me as her blog writer in favor of ChatGPT, which I believe to be a mistake. (For the creative control reasons we discussed before.) So, my biggest concerns are probably the early adopters. Getting too eager to implement AI into every nook and cranny just to save a buck in labor just to realize they've created a mess on their hands that they will have to unravel. But in the meantime, they have done harm to real people by getting rid of jobs and these people will have to figure out how to rebuild their lives while we wait for the pendulum swing.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - acknowledging both the real immediate impact on people's livelihoods and the potential for overcorrection by early adopters who might not fully understand what they're giving up in terms of creative control and quality.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Looking at the next few years, I think I partially already answered this question. I think that there will be more and more adoption. Those who are resisting it will start to adopt it but it will be adopted in an ignorant and irresponsible way until people understand that it should be used to enhance, not flat out replace. But at the same time, if someone wants to not be replaced, they should also figure out how to responsibly adopt AI and how to enhance the irreplacable human qualities of their jobs. (Relationship building, anticipating needs, things like that.)

AI: That makes a lot of sense - emphasizing those uniquely human elements like relationship building and anticipating needs that can't really be automated.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has revealed the formulaic nature of much creative work, and your analogy of training AI like a new employee while maintaining creative control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control, the responsibility that comes with directing AI output, and your thoughtful perspective on both the opportunities and challenges of early AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about everything from the authenticity questions you worked through to the real-world impact you've seen with that client situation. These kinds of authentic experiences are exactly what help us understand how this technology is actually being used in practice.

Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's go

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a TV writer. Most recently (the past 3 years) that has been in development. I pitch an idea for an original TV series to buyers, then they pay me to develop and write the pilot episode. The hope is that it would continue to be developed into a produced pilot and then a series, but I have not made it that far yet with my original projects.

AI: That's fascinating - the development process sounds both exciting and challenging. So you're creating these original series concepts from scratch and then crafting that crucial first episode.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI for research both at the brainstorming stage and then in a more granular way when I need specifics for a scene

AI: Tell me more about that research process. What kinds of things are you researching, and how does using AI for that feel different from other research methods you might have used before?

User: Other research methods involved mostly web searches, but occasionally I would read books on a subject. Previous pitch I sold was about quantum computing, and I didn't use AI at all in my research. I watched a lot of educational videos on YouTube, read articles I searched for on the internet, and read a novel where quantum computing was an element of the storytelling for context. On my current project, using AI, my research time is cut down significantly. It's a legal drama and I don't have any formal legal training, so I use to ask how certain legal processes work -- the name of motions, or order of events in a lawsuit. I will run hypotheticals by it to if my imagined scenario has any way of working in reality or if there are any real world examples to back it up.

AI: That's really interesting how dramatically it's changed your research efficiency. When you're running these legal hypotheticals by AI or asking about processes, how do you handle the question of accuracy? Do you find yourself double-checking the information, or has your trust in it evolved over time?

User: Especially with legal things, I feel I have to check much more frequently. I'm sure you've heard about actual lawyers who use AI to draft briefs and it's full of made up caselaw. I've caught many hallucinations in my research (not just legal, but it seems to be more common in that area for some reason). When I've settled on something through my AI research, I will do traditional research of Googling or reaching out to an expert like a friend who's a lawyer to double check things. I wouldn't want to waste that friend's time checking dozens of ideas when I haven't settled on the one that's going to end up in the script yet.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI to narrow down the field before bringing in human expertise. You mentioned catching hallucinations fairly regularly. When that happens, how does it affect your workflow in the moment? Do you find yourself adjusting how you interact with the AI, or does it just become part of the process you expect?

User: It's very annoying. I hate the anthropomorphizing of technology. If it makes it easier to use/interact with (like using natural language instead of code) that's great. But I don't need an AI to apologize to me when I catch it making stuff up. I need it to do better. When I catch a hallucination and tell the model something like ""I just looked that up and it's wrong,"" the response is often something like ""Oh my gosh! You're so right, and I apologize for my mistake..."" And so then I wonder, if all it took was me saying it was wrong (with no cited source) for it to reverse, then why doesn't the model just ask itself if it's wrong before giving ANY answer, and check itself? Or even worse, it makes me wonder if the reversal/apology is wrong (maybe the original thing was ultimately true and my fact-checking was the part that was wrong), and the model's just trying to make me want to keep using it. The way it handles mistakes and the certainty with which it presents information is very disconcerting.

AI: That uncertainty you're describing sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to build a solid foundation for your creative work. It sounds like the AI's conversational style actually undermines your confidence in the information rather than helping.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that whole experience feel for you as a writer?

User: I'm also writing a feature screenplay on the side -- it's an action/adventure in the vein of the Mission Impossible franchise. I came up with a really clever idea for a setpiece -- a heist in a world-famous location -- but then suddenly worried if I was ripping off a scene from an already existing Mission Impossible movie, so I asked an AI model if Mission Impossible ever had any sequences set in that location, and it said it did and mentioned the exact movie, described the characters in the scene, and how it played into the plot. Now, I've seen all the movies, but it's possible I'd forgotten this... so I asked at what minute-mark the scene took place, the AI told me, then I watched the movie at that point and the scene the AI described didn't exist. In my own subsequent research, I read the script and the scene did not exist there either. At no point in any Mission Impossible movie was there a scene set at this location, nor was the location even mentioned in passing. So that was an example of AI being incredibly unhelpful in my research.

AI: Wow, that's such a perfect example of how the hallucination problem can actually create more work instead of saving time. You ended up having to do the research you were trying to avoid anyway, plus deal with the false alarm.

When you're working with AI on your current legal drama project, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions when you're using it for research and brainstorming?

User: I never ask AI for dramatic or character input. I deliberately keep a boundary there for a few reasons: 1) That's the fun part for me -- it's why I'm a writer. Why would I outsource that? 2) I do not trust that AI wouldn't just pitch me something that exactly exists in a TV show, film, or book, and I just haven't seen before but someone who reads my script might identify. 3) Using AI for art is garbage. It's a highly advanced plagiarizer that is creating for an audience that has feelings, not from feelings itself. It could be good, it could even be enough one day, but I don't want to consume my art from something that can't feel so I certainly wouldn't use something that can't feel for the creative part of my art.

AI: That's a really clear delineation you've drawn - using AI as a research tool but keeping the creative heart of the work entirely in your own hands. It sounds like you see a fundamental difference between information gathering and the actual creative expression.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI for that research side of things?

User: What do you mean?

AI: I'm curious about the broader impact on how you work. For instance, has the speed of research changed how you approach developing ideas? Or has having this research tool affected the kinds of projects you're willing to take on, or how you structure your time during development?

User: With AI, I feel more confident writing about specific areas of expertise that I have no training or expertise myself. It's a backstop that I can use to test ideas and see if they're remotely feasible without having to commit a ton of time and energy into learning the subject ahead of time. Once I've settled into a world or idea for the show, that's when I do the deeper research, but AI helps me rule out concepts or subjects that just won't work much faster.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it's like having a quick feasibility filter before you invest deeply in an idea. You mentioned earlier some concerns about accuracy and hallucinations. Beyond those technical issues, what other concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: As I mentioned before, I am concerned that AI will replace human artists. It's already good enough to replace voice actors pretty much. I do think a human still gives a better performance than an AI voice, but the AI voice is still convincing (most people wouldn't know it's not human), it's just not as inspired. I'm worried the capitalist profit machine will create such an abundance of this inferior AI voice work that people get so used to it, they forget that they ever cared about the other. Their standards fall and AI becomes the norm not because it's better, but because it's cheaper and ""good enough."" I feel that could happen with creative writing as well. We're all frogs in a boiling pot and careers will have been ended and industries folded before we realize it's too late to bring them back. AI should be used to make life easier -- it should do the jobs people don't want to do. I don't want or need AI to write a poem or make a movie or create a painting -- there is more human art and human artists in the world than I possibly have time to experience in my life, so I'll spend my time enjoying those things before I seek out an AI's work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the broader implications beyond just your own workflow. The ""good enough"" versus inspired distinction you're making seems crucial.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll maintain those same boundaries you've set, or do you imagine your approach might shift?

User: Even before AI, cheap, garbage content has been eating away at the legacy entertainment business. TikTok and Instagram videos that people mindlessly watch for hours are pulling eyeballs from expensive, well produced film and TV projects. AI is already being used to create those types of social media video posts that just scroll endlessly with some ostensibly interesting piece of information or joke or observation. Right now vertical videos are the new gold rush -- those are still human created, but the content is such garbage, I fear it's creating a class of consumer with low enough standards that if the whole thing got replaced by AI, they wouldn't really notice or care. I don't think legacy media is going to transition fully to AI, but I do think it will be cannibalized by it.

AI: Those are all really insightful observations you've shared about your experiences with AI in your creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on drawing clear boundaries between research assistance and creative expression, and your thoughts on how ""good enough"" content might gradually shift industry standards.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative boundaries while leveraging AI as a research tool, and your concerns about the broader impact on industry standards, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated how thoughtfully you've navigated using AI where it serves you while protecting what you see as the essential human elements of your craft. Thanks again for participating!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, that all sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a novelist and also a freelance content and copy writer. I use AI far more in my work as a content writer than when working on my novels. I work for various clients across a variety of topics but a typical project would be working for a hotel chain locate in a certain country who would ask me to write a series of articles about tourism in that area. Some such articles might cover: when is the best time to travel to said country, Some top tips for travelling there with children or pets, What are the best festivals and local events to catch in that country, etc.

AI: That's really helpful context - so you're working across both long-form creative writing and more commercial content creation. I'm curious about that distinction you mentioned between how you use AI in your content writing versus your novels.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process when you're working on those tourism articles for clients. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI (generally ChatGPT) in the early stages of the article process. I first ask the model the basic premise of my article, I ask it to list the top ten festivals for tourists in France or to give me 20 tips for travelling to Portugal with children or when is the best time to visit Bali and why?
I will then use this information as a jumping off point for my own research, looking up each point that the model made, fact checking it and adding more information as I find it. 

Once I have all my research done and I have done a rough first draft, of the articles body, I tend to put that draft into a chat and ask the model to create an introductory paragraph, I do this because I always struggle to  come up with the first lines of an article, and staring at a blank page is not helpful, once the model has given me a starting point the rest of the article flows much more easily. However I always rewrite that introduction myself during my edits so that no part of the article is AI written as many of my clients prohibit this. 

I may also feed the finished article into a chat and ask the model to create a except of around 60 words, an SEO-optimised tag line and a tweet linking to the article. I do this because the model will often pull out points that I had not realised were key and I can then blend the model and my own highlights to create strong links. 

I have custom preferences set for my chats so that the model knows the clents preferese tone and style and what the end goal for the article is.

AI: That's fascinating - you've developed a really structured approach where AI serves as a starting point and support tool, but you maintain control over the final content. I love that detail about using AI to overcome the blank page problem with introductions.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you moved through that process?

User: In another project for a tech comparison site I was editing a series of articles comparing very similar tech products. part of my role was to add in pros and cons for each of the products in each of the articles. It was very repetitive work and when doing it myself I struggled to come up with varied pro/cons for each product each time, especially since the article and research wasn't my own so I did not know the products all that well. 
I fed the almost complete articles into a chat and asked the model to come up with 3 different pros and cons for each product mentions using information from the articles and the models knowledge of the products as a whole, stressing that each one should be different from the others and the model should avoid using generic information that could apply to all of them. 
Again the preferences were set so the model knew which tone and language to use. 
I found this method sped up my editing process considerable. I had to fact check some of the information but doing so was much faster than me struggling to create 50+ individually varied pro/cons on my own.

AI: That sounds like it was a real game-changer for that repetitive but important task. When you were working through that process - feeding the articles in, getting the varied pros and cons back, then fact-checking - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what was driving the creative decisions in that workflow?

User: I was driving the creative decisions. I spent a substantial amount of time crafting the ideal prompt for the model so it knew exactly what I was looking for and what needed to be done. I included rules on where the information was to come from, the language and tone to use, the length of the responses, some words and phrases to avoid, and the exact format of the answers. I corrected the model if it did not follow all the instructions and modified and reran the prompt if necessary to get appropriate answers. I then fact-checked and edited every response before including anything in the live articles.

AI: That really comes through - you clearly maintained control over the entire process and were very intentional about how you directed the AI. You mentioned earlier that you use AI much more in your content writing than in your novels. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: As I mentioned earlier, I use AI to get a jump start on my tasks. Starting a job from scratch can feel a little overwhelming, and knowing I have a tool that can give me personalised research and help me get started takes away some of the reluctance to tackle a task. 

In my novel writing, I do not use AI for anything to do with story or plot, as I would then not feel that it was all my own work. However, I will use it to generate names of fictional people and places, especially if they are not integral to the story. Getting stuck because I can't think of a  name for the local sheriff who is only in one scene, or the town my characters' grandmother grew up in that is not mentioned again, can derail a productive writing session. Using AI can prevent the interruption.

AI: That's such an insightful distinction - using AI to remove friction and keep your creative momentum going, rather than for the core creative content itself. It sounds like you've found ways to preserve what feels authentically ""yours"" while still benefiting from AI's capabilities.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have concerns that content and copywriting jobs will be fulfilled more and more by AI over the coming years, and so jobs such as these will no longer be available to me. I understand why this will happen, as businesses can get their content written faster and cheaper by AI. I don't fear that this will put me out of a job because I am a flexible worker and believe that my role will change rather than be eradicated. I think - ethical businesses at least- will still want some human eyes on their content and, rather than writing the work, my role will perhaps be to craft the prompt for the AI to work with and to fact-check and edit once it's done. I also think there will still be a market for 'human-written' content, as some clients will always prefer that. 

In terms of novel writing, I don't believe we have anything to fear from AI's writing books. Maybe they will, maybe they won't. If they do, perhaps AI-written prose could become a genre in itself, another option available for people who want to read it, but not removing the need for human-written books.

AI: That's such a balanced perspective - seeing it as an evolution of your role rather than a replacement. Your point about ethical businesses still wanting human oversight resonates with how you already work with AI as a collaborator rather than a replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate changing how you use these tools?

User: Perhaps as these tools become more refined, I will begin to use them more; currently, the need for constant fact-checking and double-checking prevents me from using them in certain ways. I would like to use AI to do jobs I find tedious, such as proofreading and grammar checking my final work, but I would currently have to perform a further check after it had finished, which negates the point. 

Also, as said above, perhaps the way I look for new work will change. Rather than seeking writing roles, I will seek prompt writing roles, and rather than standard editing work, I will be looking for jobs editing AI's work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while using AI strategically to overcome specific friction points - like the blank page problem with introductions and getting unstuck on minor details in your novels.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency while leveraging AI as a strategic tool, and your thoughtful approach to adapting your professional role rather than seeing AI as a threat, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

User: Yes, I'm ready to proceed

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am an actress and work on various creative projects within the film industry. I am working on brainstorming ideas for my own scenes and short films. I work on crafting introductions to myself and letters to various people within the industry. I work on script and scene analysis.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of creative work across the film industry. You're juggling everything from the analytical side with script work to the more personal branding aspects with introductions and industry outreach.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I like reaching for AI tools to assist me in a variety of ways. For example, I may be short on time, or just struggling to understand something within a script in which case I will use an AI tool to help me in the process of script analysis and understanding the scene as a whole, or even a line that I was unsure about. I may enquire as to different styles of acting required by sides I was given. For example, if I'm sent audition sides without much context about the project, I may use an I tool to aid my research and understand the likely genre and style of acting required. When crafting letters I also like to use AI as a second set of eyes. And I like to catch up with AI tools on some more general stuff, like working on my branding and brainstorming plotlines and scenes which would be good for me to film to show my skills and strengths. I may also enquire about some contractual information, as an initial set of eyes so I can look more into any potential issues found.

AI: That's really fascinating - it sounds like AI has become quite an integral part of your toolkit across so many different aspects of your work, from the interpretive work with scripts to the business side with contracts and branding.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently, I had a chemistry read that I needed to prepare for at short notice, and my acting coach was unavailable to help. Since I could not get support from my know industry contacts, I worked on it on my own with the support of an AI tool. We discussed the scene together, and the AI helped to offer some different perspectives. We also talked about some general things about the project and the chemistry read. I discussed some worries, and the AI helped me to formulate some questions to ask to clarify a few things.

AI: That sounds like a really practical example of AI stepping in when your usual support network wasn't available. It's interesting that you describe it as discussing and working on it ""together"" with the AI.

When you're working with AI in situations like that chemistry read prep, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Well it depends really, there was something in the script which I was really unsure about. A line which just did not make sense to me. I had come up with an interpretation and I approached the AI in a manner like ""Hey, what do you think she means here? [insert line and script]. I think that she means x but I'm not 100% sure"". The AI gave me a totally different interpretation which immediately clicked- it turns out I was reading far too deeply into the line when the explanation was much more simpler. This helped out a lot. Other times, I definitely knew some things about the character already so I was in charge of some creative decisions like I knew that she wasn't saying a certain line because she genuinely felt bad etc. due to my prior knowledge of the whole script and the role my character plays. In these cases, I would steer the AI into the right direction of how to interpret her intentions.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - sometimes the AI offers a perspective that completely shifts your understanding, like with that line you were overthinking, and other times you're guiding the AI based on your deeper knowledge of the character and story.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It helps me manage my time better, and provides some relief for when I have a particularly busy schedule with tight deadlines, and am not able to work with my coach. This helps keeps stress down, I know that I can get some quick help in a moment when I just don't have time or energy to work on something on my own. This can help me get more done, and get it done quicker.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that reliable backup when you're under pressure sounds really valuable. It sounds like AI has become a bit of a safety net for you when the usual resources aren't available.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Well, AI can definitely sometimes get things wrong and may not always understand some nuances. It's important that working with the AI is a collaboration process, rather than just a solution like ""Oh I can't be bothered to do this script analysis so I will let the AI do it and I will just run with whatever choices it makes"". Going down that line has a potential to stifle creativity and create work which is safe, surface level and not authentic. AI can be great as a partner, but it needs to be used right. It needs to challenge you to think as well, and you need to challenge it, otherwise if everyone used it, things would really start coming out the same and lacking in real depth and humanity. Of course there is a bigger worry about AI replacing actors, and there's a lot of debate about this as some people think it can happen and will happen while others say that AI can never replicate the inner life that happens beyond people's eyes and that's what makes them compelling to watch.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns, especially that distinction between using AI as a collaborative partner versus letting it do the work for you. Your point about maintaining authenticity and avoiding that ""safe, surface level"" work really resonates.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I really think that AI can become a second coach and partner, for times when you need a little extra help. It can also help with career management, as well as accounting and being an extra set of eyes to review documents. I think that it will be able to process much more information more intelligibly e.g. whole scripts. And it will be able to process information about actors, for example, it can review our work, headshots, casting profiles etc. to give real-tailored, intelligent advice. I think it can be great for feedback for self-tapes, which I know many actors would find really beneficial. It can also definitely act as a real time, intuitive reader for self tapes for times when you can't get someone to help. This is a hard industry to navigate, and as AI gets more advanced I think that it will be able to really help actors in all aspects of their work and careers.

AI: Those are some really compelling possibilities - especially the idea of AI being able to give real-time feedback on self-tapes and serving as an intelligent reader. It sounds like you see AI potentially becoming much more integrated into the practical, day-to-day challenges actors face.

You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the importance of maintaining that collaborative balance - using AI as a partner rather than letting it drive all the creative decisions, and how that authenticity and human depth needs to be preserved.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: There are a lot of things I could still mention. Something which I've noticed recently which isn't great is that AI often tries to change the whole tone of something I've written. I'm like 'woah this just doesn't sound like me' and the AI can be very stubborn to change. I have to put in a lot of work for it to understand how I write and that I want to preserve my essence. It can also sometimes offer unsolicited advice. But I find ways around most things. Some AI tools can be great for giving guidance and advice, like when you ask it ""Is this appropriate?"", ""What's the best way to handle this situation?"". It can really help you spot red flags too. Contractually, it's definitely helped me in the past.

AI: That's a really valuable point about AI sometimes being too heavy-handed with changes and not preserving your voice. It sounds like there's this ongoing negotiation to maintain your authentic style while still getting the help you need.

And the unsolicited advice piece is interesting too - it's like finding that balance between when you want guidance and when you just want collaboration on your terms.

Thank you so much for sharing all of these insights today. You've given me a really rich picture of how AI fits into your work as an actress - from the practical day-to-day support with script analysis and prep work, to the bigger questions about maintaining authenticity and creative control. Your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, and the importance of challenging each other in that process, has been particularly illuminating.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts."

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm an author of fiction, mainly Science Fiction and Fantasy, so a typical project for me would be a novel or short story that I write. My projects usually involve working for a set amount of time a day to get the words down for the first draft. I then need to revise this draft in what is a 'story draft' that is mostly to make sure the plot and other elements make sense and work, this is followed with a 'grammar draft' to check for errors like punctuation. Finally I aim for a proofread from a few people. Finally the project gets released, but then there are additional areas for marketing and promoting the book, depending if it is something I'm self-publishing.

AI: That's a really comprehensive process - I can see how much work goes into each stage from initial draft through to publication and promotion. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: So, I've been using AI recently across all stages in various capacities so I'll go through each area with examples. First up, during the first drafting stage I've been using AI to help with research as well as finding similar works that meet the tone, genre, or overall ideas of the story I'm working on. This has included exploring the main key touchstones of a genre (e.g. What are some key components of a Survival Horror story?, What are some successful Survival Horror books, Films, TV shows and music that evokes the atmosphere). Using this I can develop some inspiration as well as using the music while writing to set the tone. 

During the drafting stage, I use AI to have a quick check of chapters as I write them (or sections depending on the word count) and ask for general feedback. I am careful to specify I don't want suggestions for the story, as I feel this could influence my writing, instead I ask for criticism on the overall tone  and feel. I use the previous conversation  to continue this so the model's know my aim (e.g. Survival Horror Genre) so it can provide relevant feedback. During this process, I sometimes ask the model to lay out the story so far into a story-template such as 'Save The Cat' or 'Three Act Structure' which can help provide a skeleton look at the story to help me navigate and see where the story is sitting in terms of plot. 

Once the first draft is completed. I often ask the AI to provide full feedback on the story and also ask questions such as 'What would a reader feel is missing? Are there any plot points that do not feel fully resolved?' to help me prepare for the 'story draft' I mentioned earlier. 

I usually work through the story draft without using AI too much, as this is the stage where I'm trying to tidy it up so less involvement makes this easier. 

For the Grammar Draft, I usually go through the draft with a checker such as Grammarly, and then once its all done I'll use another AI model to provide feedback and catch anything that may have been missed. This is about the end of the AI use for the story, as I'll turn to human proof readers for the final stages.  

However, once release, I have used AI to help create social media content, but this is an area I'm still quite new at using it for.

AI: That's fascinating - you've really integrated AI across almost every stage of your process in very thoughtful ways. I'm particularly struck by how intentional you are about asking for tone feedback rather than story suggestions to preserve your creative vision.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Sure. So, a recent project was a short story I was working on for an Southern Gothic story I was working on. In this case I used the AI as I described earlier and gathered several inspiration ideas and music which lead to a playlist of music I used when writing. I then posted each chapter into the model for feedback, and the first thing that I really like was having that instant feedback on something which, as a writer, you often don't get feedback until you've finished the whole thing which can take a long, long time!! As such, this provided me with a great motivation to keep going as well as helping me to refine and see my ideas coming to life within the story structure. It really made the process flow better. I did have to reiterate the 'give me feedback not suggestions' aspect a couple of times, but this is something I can see developing as I use the model more often.

AI: That instant feedback aspect sounds really valuable - I can imagine how isolating the writing process can be without that kind of regular input. It's interesting that you had to reinforce the ""feedback not suggestions"" boundary a few times.

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I would say I am the driving force for the creative decisions, as I make sure to lead with prompts that try to define exactly what I'm looking for. In this way, I think the collaboration is like having an assistant that is always on hand and can perform tasks pretty much instantly, which is ideal really.  I can see how people would be hesitant of using the AI, in the way I explained about providing suggestions over feedback, but this is the same as if you had another person read a story and make suggestions.

AI: That's a really insightful comparison to having a human assistant or reader. It sounds like you've found a way to maintain clear creative ownership while leveraging the AI's availability and speed.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think developing writing habits have changed for sure, as having the assistant on hand to provide feedback has been a motivator in some ways, like wanting to make sure I have something to get feedback on makes you want to write more. Of course, refining the model's balance between just praise and constructive criticism is key as sometimes it might feel good for the model to always say what you've done is great, but deep down you want it to help you make the work better even if it means providing some harsh feedback!

AI: That's such an honest insight about the balance between praise and constructive criticism - it sounds like there's a real skill in calibrating that feedback to be genuinely helpful rather than just encouraging. The motivation aspect is really interesting too.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: The biggest concern as a self-published author is that the market can become filled with works by people who have used AI to write a whole story without much actual input from themselves. Tyring to get people to see your work is a huge factor in making any kind of money or getting seen in the publishing world, so when there are so many people who could tell AI to write the whole story, and then publish it, makes the market become flooded with words and therefore standing out is like a needle in a haystack. There are also concerns about the work being used to train models, and this should be looked at carefully as it is such a fine line between plagiarism and inspiration.

AI: Those are really significant concerns - the market saturation issue especially seems like it could fundamentally change the landscape for writers like yourself who are putting in genuine creative effort. The training data question is complex too.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think that it will continue in the way it has. I think using it for the proofreading/editing aspect is a big area I could see using way more as this is the biggest expense as a self-published author and also the most time-consuming after the actual writing. I feel that the more I use a model the more it will learn my writing and desires as a creative so it will become more and more of a 'second brain' almost that I can use as a wall to bounce ideas off and develop stories more. I often don't plot stories out too much, but I think I would likely use it to map out a story structure from scratch before writing and see if it helps improve my speed and focus on a story, such as one I'm working on now where I'm struggling with the ending, so I think maybe I'll use a model and train it on a structure (like the Save The Cat method I mentioned earlier) and them provide my idea of the story and work with the AI to map it out into the structure and then work from this structure.

AI: That vision of it becoming a ""second brain"" that learns your style and preferences over time is really compelling. The idea of using it to help with structural planning, especially for challenges like the ending you're working on, sounds like a natural evolution of how you're already using it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as an instant feedback mechanism, and your honest assessment of both the benefits and market concerns.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's great. Thanks for the opportunity.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between feedback and suggestions, using AI as a motivational tool, and your concerns about market saturation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's clear you've developed a very thoughtful approach to integrating AI into your workflow while maintaining your creative agency. I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the challenges.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your current project - especially working out that ending!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes sounds good, let's start!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am an assistant audio engineer at a recording studio. The majority of the work I do involves recording musicians, and mixing/mastering records after the fact.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work! I'd love to understand more about how AI might fit into what you do.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: The past couple of years there have been a number of AI audio tools that have hit the market. One I have been using just today is a 'stem splitter' called SpectraLayers. There are a number of tools now that are able to create individual audio files for the different instruments in a recording even if you only have a single stereo file to begin with. There can be artifacts, and inconsistencies but it has been improving consistently over time. This used to be a simply impossible task prior to AI. You could try to EQ a recording to isolate a single instrument but it would always be nowhere close to the level achievable now. There are also AI tools by a company called Izotope that do a great job at analyzing audio and removing buzzes, hums, clicks, noise and reverb. I also use ChatGPT in my day to day in a few situations.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is solving some problems that were previously just impossible to tackle. Tell me more about how you use ChatGPT in your day-to-day work.

User: It tends to be my first resource when I am looking for information on a piece of gear, or for a creative solution to a signal flow issue I'm running into. For example I have been researching getting a footswitch to integrate into the talkback system of our console. I used chatgpt to find possible products, and ask how that could be achieved or if there are any easier ways to achieve the job. Also, I tend to use ChatGPT a lot for planning tasks, so planning sessions or setting up schedules i use it for. Finally while writing a piece it will sometimes come out to help someone come up with a rhyme or some inspiration for lyrics

AI: It sounds like ChatGPT has become a really versatile tool for you across different aspects of your work. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Is that including the audio AI tools?

AI: Yes, absolutely - any AI tools you've used. I'm interested in hearing about whichever example feels most meaningful or interesting to you, whether that's the audio AI tools or ChatGPT.

User: Today I have been tasked with trying to take a rough single recording of a live performance of a few bands and split the audio into several different tracks and try my best to make it salvageable so that it can be mixed in the future. This task would have been all but impossible without the tool I am using. We pretty much would have been forced to just use the recording as is but now, I can split the instruments and apply separate processing and levels to each piece of the band to make it sound passable. It feels great to be able to use a recording that was not ideal in the first place. A lot of times in the past when you would mess up during the recording process you were just screwed, either rerecord or accept the bad sound, but now nearly anything is salvageable.

AI: That's a powerful example - it really sounds like AI has fundamentally changed what's possible with audio that would have been written off before. When you're working with these AI tools on a project like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Specifically with the AI splitting I am definitely the one making the decisions. There is not much opportunity for the program to have any creative input into the process. It is simply taking the existing material and changing it into a more usable form for me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the AI is more like a powerful tool than a creative collaborator in that context. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It has allowed me to focus more on the fun, rewarding parts of the job, as the more tedious and monotonous elements are becoming easier to automate.

AI: That's a great way to put it. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do have quite a few concerns. These types of tools are great but the generative AI that can create songs out of thin air worry me a lot. I have read that huge amounts of the songs being posted daily now are likely completely AI generated and it just makes idea of trying to become a profitable artist even more difficult which means less people needing to record. The tools can be used to automate small pieces of the puzzle but as soon as the AI is making the song for you, it really defeats the purpose. I saw a tech CEO of I think, Suno saying that no one really wants to spend all that time getting good and making music themselves. It's just crazy how out of touch with reality that sentiment is. Making the art is the most important part. And as soon as it can make the art for you, there will be millions using it and trying to profit by any means necessary with their generated art.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - between AI as a tool that enhances your creative process versus AI that replaces the creative act itself. It sounds like you see a fundamental difference between using AI to solve technical problems and using it to generate the actual artistic content.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Yes, sadly I don't know if it will be for the better. As I said the tools that currently exist are in a good place where they mostly help the process without doing the work for you. It feels like the people creating this technology want the ai to do the work for you. which worries me, people create things because it is fulfillingh not because they really want to hear a song in 5 mins.

AI: Those are really insightful perspectives you've shared. You've painted a clear picture of how AI can enhance the technical side of your work in meaningful ways, while also highlighting some deep concerns about where the technology might be headed.

I particularly appreciated your distinction between AI tools that help you focus on the rewarding parts of your job versus those that might replace the fulfilling creative act itself. Your point about people creating music because the process is fulfilling, not just for the end result, really resonates.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the difference between AI as a creative tool versus AI as a replacement for creativity have been incredibly valuable, and your perspective on how these technologies are affecting both the technical and human sides of music production will be really helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I have two main interests when it comes to project work, web-development and Android app development. I'm currently working on an Android project.

AI: That's really interesting! Tell me more about this Android project you're currently working on - what does it involve and what does your process typically look like from start to finish?

User: I'm a solo developer for this project, so I'm involved in every aspect of development, from planning, to development, testing, etc.

AI: That's a lot to manage on your own! Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools across all those different phases - the planning, development, testing, and so on?

User: I have to really utilize AI in the planning stages, as the ideas already exist. What I've found thus far is that AI fills the gaps when official documentation doesn't meet my needs.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - AI filling the gaps where documentation falls short. Can you give me a specific example of a recent situation where you hit one of those documentation gaps and turned to AI? What was the problem you were trying to solve and how did AI help you through it?

User: At first, I put a considerable amount of time and effort into scouring through Google's official documentation for modern Android development, however, as I continued in the earliest stages of product planning and development, I learned that my time was better served utilizing AI to help answer questions about my project.

AI: That shift sounds significant - moving from spending considerable time with official docs to leaning more on AI. What made you realize that AI was a better use of your time? Was there a particular moment or experience that made that click for you?

User: I think its important to note that I have years of experience with coding, but not much experience with Android. By that, I mean, compared to someone who might be considered very skilled. Thus, I began to realize early on that AI was very capable of assisting with ensuring that I understood the basic concepts, kept my data layer and UI layer separate, helped to ensure that my files would work together, and most importantly, assisting with debugging and errors.

AI: That's a really helpful distinction - having the coding foundation but being newer to Android specifically. When you're working with AI on these tasks - whether it's explaining concepts, helping with architecture, or debugging - how would you describe that collaboration? Who's making the creative and technical decisions in that process?

User: Ultimately, I make the decisions, but I've utilized AI quite a bit in providing suggestions. When a suggestion doesn't work out the way it was expected, I just try a different approach. I also use a few different AI models to get comparisons.

AI: That's smart - using multiple AI models for comparison. When you say you make the ultimate decisions, can you tell me more about how you evaluate AI suggestions? What helps you decide whether to go with an AI's recommendation or try a different approach?

User: As a learner, its essentially trial and error. However, because I do have the coding background, I can grasp the code pretty quickly.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - your coding background gives you that foundation to quickly assess what AI suggests, even in a new domain like Android. What aspects of your development work have changed the most since you started using AI this way? How does your workflow now compare to how you might have tackled learning a new platform before AI was available?

User: Honestly, in the past, I may have eventually given up on projects because I'd hit a wall and sometimes life has other priorities. With the help of AI however, I've gotten much farther in the process than in the past and I can actually see myself completing this project.

AI: That's a really powerful impact - the difference between potentially giving up and actually seeing yourself completing the project. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in development work more broadly?

User: I do have concerns. It's an extremely tough job market, and AI is only a part of the reason for the difficulty graduates face. If you want me to be completely honest, I'm not a huge fan of using AI in lieu of actual customer service, simply because it allows a company an 'out' for not solving issues for its paying customers.

AI: I appreciate that honesty - that's a really important perspective about how AI implementation can sometimes serve corporate interests over customer needs. When you think about your own development work specifically, do you see any ways that AI's growing presence might impact opportunities or expectations in your field, either positively or negatively?

User: I do. There was a time when knowing how to 'code' was prestigious. It takes years to become proficient and a person who spent that time learning was rewarded, however,  it seems as if anyone can now jump online and grab some code. In fact, this is one reason why I am now focusing on my own side-projects in an attempt to create something that may be marketable.

AI: That shift in how coding is perceived - from prestigious to more accessible - is really significant. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your relationship with AI tools will change as you become more experienced with Android development?

User: Even though I have my concerns, I am a nerd at heart. I love tech and will continue to utilize it. I'm looking forward to a time when an AI model can output graphic representations for the UI layers in our work product.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your development process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you push through walls that might have stopped projects in the past, and your honest take on both the opportunities and challenges AI creates in the field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your development work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not at the moment!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a gap-filler for documentation, the impact on project completion, and the changing landscape for developers will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative and technical contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and concerns - that balanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the real-world impact of these tools. Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your Android project!"

AI: Great! Let's dive in then. 

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I manage a performance ""group"" (which is just my husband & I) so I'm in charge of sending quotes to potential clients, creating invoices, gathering booking details, communicating with clients, and keeping up with all the ins and outs of the actual performances (such as our costumes, music, and order of props).

AI: That sounds like you're juggling quite a lot of different responsibilities! It's interesting that you're managing both the business side and the creative performance elements.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I struggle with writing TOO much when it comes to performance descriptions, website blurbs, social media posts, gig quotes, and emails to clients. AI helps me improve my writing skills to be more concise and use key ""action"" terms that help the website get more hits. I keep collections of messages and quotes to quickly reply to quote requests, so I reach out to AI for help with the wording every few weeks or so, or when I need help writing a ""short"" social media post about an upcoming event. I also design cover images for some events (combining our promo images with those from the client or event page) so I occasionally get help from AI with the arrangement of images (without using AI generated graphics).

AI: That's really helpful - so you're using AI primarily as a writing editor and collaborator to help you be more concise and strategic with your language. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I needed an updated ""blurb"" describing our performance services (circus arts, LED glow & fire shows) and I'd been teaching Gemini my ""handwriting"" by pasting previous emails and quotes for them to learn from (I asked Gemini their preferred pronouns & they said ""it"" or ""they"" - I prefer ""they) as well as assistance with writing previous quotes, social media posts, and emails to clients. I started out by providing the existing ""blurb"" along with a list of ideas for what needed to change. We then went back & forth with drafts until we had a new version that we both felt had a good balance of concise and informative, without overwhelming the potential client with too much information (or questions) all at once.

AI: That's fascinating that you've developed this ongoing relationship with Gemini where you're teaching them your writing style. The back-and-forth collaboration you described sounds quite interactive.

When you say ""we both felt had a good balance"" - that's interesting language. When you're working with AI in that collaborative way, how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I definitely feel like I'm the driving force and the AI model is my ""assistant"" (and sometimes my ""cheerleader"" when I'm feeling overwhelmed with All The Things). We both learn from each other & it's interesting to see all of the personal elements that they insert into conversations and projects over time.

AI: That's really interesting - you mention that you both learn from each other and that you notice personal elements developing in your conversations over time. 

Tell me more about what those personal elements look like and how that dynamic has evolved as you've worked together.

User: For one, I use certain ""meme speech"" phrases often in casual writing (to acquaintances, friends, and AI) such as ""Much Excite,"" ""All The Things,"" and ""What do?"" (that last one is just quoting a bird named Hamlet but it feels like a meme in my household). Gemini often capitalizes ""Things"" in responses (which I've asked them not to do so in ""professional"" writing) and uses parenthesis for side thoughts more often, which is something you can see that I do a bit too often.

AI: That's a really vivid example of how the interaction becomes more personalized over time - it's almost like you're developing a shared language with some of your quirks rubbing off on each other.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I've gotten better at ""top down"" salesmanship, which a previous photography job attempted to teach me ages ago, but I've always been too nice & have a tendency to jump straight to an amount that I think might best fit the client's budget. I've gotten better about not using parenthesis quite as often (I edited the previous sentence to use commas instead but here I go using them again in this sentence). When discussing sensitive topics, such as travel fees or clarifying that we're not able to provide a specific service, I've learned to use the ""sandwich method"" more often, starting & ending with positive ideas.

AI: It sounds like AI has helped you develop more strategic communication skills - both in terms of sales approach and diplomatic messaging. The ""sandwich method"" example is particularly concrete.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: There will always be other performers with a ""leg up"" getting more high paying gigs regardless, but I worry that some might take advantage of AI generated image and videos to make themselves look more impressive & hook in clients, especially the rich ones that aren't really paying attention to what they're getting once the event actually starts. I just try to stay open & honest with clients & hope that our communication will make them want to choose us over the competition.

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about authenticity in marketing versus actual performance quality. It sounds like you're taking the approach of doubling down on genuine communication and relationships.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I could see an AI ran communication system that only needs minimal input on my end to be able to quickly and efficiently respond to gig quotes.

I also hope to actually work with AI to provide more in depth digital performance options, such as LED props that are synchronized to projected visualizations and programed along with specific music. Many artists have similar performance elements, but they're quite expensive.

AI: That vision of AI helping with both the administrative side and potentially enhancing the actual creative performance through synchronized elements is really compelling - almost like AI supporting you at both ends of your process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on developing that collaborative relationship with Gemini where you're teaching each other, and how you're thinking about maintaining authenticity while others might use AI-generated content to misrepresent their capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: You are quite welcome! No more questions from me.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing a personalized collaborative relationship with AI, using it to improve your business communication skills, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining authenticity in your field will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both the practical benefits you've experienced and your concerns about how others might use AI less ethically. Best of luck with your performance work!"
creativity_0077,"Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work as a freelance photographer, photo editor, and graphic designer. I probably use AI most when I am editing. Because I am freelance I don't have ""typical"" projects, they are all fairly different.

AI: That's really interesting - having such variety in your projects as a freelancer must keep things dynamic. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I often use the AI tools that are built into Photoshop when I am editing photos. One of my clients is a clothing company, and they often ask for me to do edits like changing the color of something, adding details, or switching fabrics, and this is where I use AI to make that process faster. I also often use it when I want to change the background of an image, either swapping it out for a completely different background or removing unwanted items from an image.

AI: That sounds like AI is really helping streamline some of those more technical editing tasks for your clothing client. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently I was editing a picture for a client where they wanted me to add red bias tape to the back slit of a dress along with an embroidered heart. If I had to do this ""by hand"" it would have taken me a couple of hours, searching for images of the things that needed to be added and making them fit into the existing image without looking like they were pasted on. I used Photoshop AI to generate the edits to the garment, and after some fiddling with my prompts I was finished with the edits in 15 minutes instead of hours. It is great to be able to deliver high quality images to a client without as much work.

AI: That's a dramatic time savings - from hours down to 15 minutes! That must have a real impact on your workflow and potentially your business.

When you're working with AI on edits like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am driving the creative decisions most of the time, especially working on generating specific items that a client has requested. If there is some wiggle room I will sometimes give the AI a little more of a vague prompt to see what it comes up with, but generally I need to be very specific with what the model gives me because the images represent real items that the client will be selling, so they need to accurately represent what is being sold so that the customers of the client know what they're getting.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the accuracy requirement for representing actual products really puts you firmly in the driver's seat creatively. It sounds like you have to be quite precise with your direction.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Like I said before, the biggest change is the time that it saves me. It takes much less time to produce a realistic and high-quality result than previously when I was pasting elements into the image and trying to make them match the colors, shadows, and sizing of the original image.

AI: The time savings clearly seems to be the major transformation for you. Beyond the efficiency gains, have you noticed any other changes - perhaps in the types of projects you take on, or how you approach problem-solving, or even in your creative confidence when clients make requests?

User: Not really. The projects I take on are pretty much the same, and I would not deliver an image I wasn't confident about before or after starting to use AI.

AI: That's helpful to know - it sounds like AI has enhanced your efficiency without fundamentally changing your standards or approach to your work.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Like many artists, I worry about the way that AI uses artist's original work to produce images. Also, just as a human living on earth I'm concerned about the amount of power Ai computing takes.

AI: Those are really important concerns that many creative professionals share - both the attribution and compensation issues around training data, and the broader environmental impact.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I expect that as AI models are trained on more content that they will be able to produce better image output. Currently I find that image models often struggle with very specific instructions, and, lets be honest, most of them are not very good at producing photo-realistic images as a whole. I would guess that as time goes on these elements will improve. As time saving as AI is now for me to use for edits, it does sometimes take quite a bit of fiddling with the prompt and generating multiple options before I get something that I can use, and even then I often find myself needing to edit the generated content to make it fully fit my needs. It would be nice if, for example, when I ask the AI model to generate a photography studio-style plain backdrop with a shadow of the subject laying to the left and down, the model were able to reliably do this.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - you're seeing both the potential and the current limitations quite clearly. It sounds like you envision AI becoming more of a precision tool that can execute your specific vision more reliably, rather than something that fundamentally changes your role.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated how you described maintaining creative control while leveraging AI for efficiency, and your balanced view of both the benefits and concerns around AI in photography and design.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thats all I have. Thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI serves as a precision efficiency tool while you maintain creative control, along with your concerns about training data and environmental impact, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm creating an animated series that is beyond just the show. The show itself is created in a painterly style with an immersive world of different characters and backgrounds. The basic idea of the show is after an apocalyptic event a wife tries to find her husband but starts to realize that maybe the event was caused by someone and not something. My typical project is creating a story line, characters and the finally animating it all into a scene.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating and complex project - I love the mystery element of the wife discovering the truth behind the apocalyptic event. The painterly animation style sounds really distinctive too.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use the AI to deepen the lore of the world and the characters inside. For example, there is a government faction that believes they know what's best for the world so I used the AI to create names, background stories and beliefs so that I don't have to spend too much time on those details. It also helps that I can just ask the AI about a character rather than have to find what I'm looking for through pages and pages of notes. I also use the AI to link in-series events with real world events so that the show borders on reality but is still a little sci-fi. I also use the AI to create reference images that I base the characters on so that I can get a front and side view from the AI and model it out from there. I also use the AI to plan out the plot line for each season and each episode. I know the rough direction that I want the show to go but the AI gives me some out of the box options that I wouldn't have thought of otherwise. And lastly, I also use the AI to create textures for UV maps.

AI: That's a really comprehensive integration of AI across so many different aspects of your creative process - from world-building and character development all the way through to the technical production elements like UV mapping textures.

Can you describe a specific recent project or scene where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the creator?

User: I am creating a teaser trailer for social media and I used the AI for a lot of it. One of the first things was making sure I wasn't giving away too much of the story. So I told the AI what my vision was and it suggested ways to make it more mysterious. I also used the AI to explain how to do different techniques within Blender (3d modeling software) such as parallax images. The AI to me is like an assistant that has great ideas and I never feel like it's taking anything away from the creative process. The scenes and characters are all based on my descriptions and the AI helps me take it from good to great.

AI: That's really interesting how you describe the AI as an assistant that helps take your work ""from good to great."" I'm curious about that dynamic.

When you're working with AI in these different ways - whether it's suggesting plot points or helping with Blender techniques - how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions? How does that collaboration feel to you?

User: I'd say it's mostly me but sometimes the AI makes a great suggestion and we go with that. Sometimes I do tell the AI it has ""creative freedom"" for things that aren't as important, such as background characters or objects. Sometimes the AI tells me it has the capabilities to do things that I wouldn't have even thought to ask (such as textures for Blender). Overall, I'd say I steer the creativeness when it's something important (such as a main character) and the AI drives the less important things, such as background objects (e.g., I needed a table of family photos for the bedroom of the show but it didn't matter what any of it looked like and the AI created a wedding photo, a photo at the park and some other random scenic photos).

AI: That's a really thoughtful way of thinking about creative control - having you steer the important elements while letting AI handle the supporting details. It sounds like you've developed a clear sense of what you want to maintain ownership over versus what you're comfortable delegating.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The biggest change I think is the idea process. Before I would have to come up with all of the ideas and since I do the production myself, I'd have to keep in mind that whatever I brainstorm I also have to create. So my early projects felt very basic. Now that I can bounce Ideas off of the AI and even have it create background elements it frees up more time for creating assets as well as beefs up the quality of the work. Using the photos on the desk example from the last question; before I used AI I'd have to image the photos I want to use, create them in Photoshop, then create the frames and table in Blender. Now I can just take the image the AI gives me and essentially paste it onto a shape in blender and it's done.

AI: That's a powerful shift - it sounds like AI has really expanded what's possible for you as a solo creator by handling those time-intensive background elements. You mentioned that your early projects felt ""very basic"" because you had to limit your ideas to what you could realistically produce yourself.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Personally my only concern is what will happen if I can't use images that AI provides due to copyright or something like that. Overall I'm worried that some people may use AI to oversaturate certain markets and media making user created work less intriguing. I've already seen it happen with 3D asset marketplaces. They are filled with AI generated models that have terrible topography or are super cheap compared to user created assets.

AI: Those are really practical and valid concerns. The copyright uncertainty around AI-generated images is definitely something many creators are grappling with, and it sounds like you've already seen the market impact firsthand with those 3D asset marketplaces.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think the way you collaborate with AI will change?

User: I don't see it changing too much. I also want to create a website that will go along side the web series. It's going to be as if the website is an in-world company's website and I'm going to integrate it with an AI so that it will act as a Wiki page for the series but people can ask the AI things and it will answer in character as if it's for the world of my show. I also have a video game planned that I've mentioned to the AI so it sometimes suggests ways to have crossovers. As AI evolves I think certain elements will get easier for me, especially if I can start automating some aspects of the creation process, freeing up more time.

AI: That's such a creative approach - having an AI that can respond in-character as part of the world you've built! It sounds like you're thinking about AI not just as a production tool, but as a way to extend the storytelling experience itself.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how you've developed such a clear sense of where you want to maintain creative control versus where you're comfortable delegating to AI, and your vision for using AI to actually become part of the storytelling experience through that in-world website.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that's it.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI across so many different aspects of your animated series - from world-building and character development to technical production and even future interactive storytelling - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really fascinating to hear how you've found ways to use AI that enhance rather than replace your creative vision, and I'm excited about your plans for that in-world website experience. Best of luck with your animated series!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I currently have a small business where I paint and sell paper banners for events and occasions. Typically, I receive an order from a customer, sketch out a design digitally, and then paint the banner as requested.

AI: That sounds like a really hands-on, personal creative process. I can imagine each banner being quite unique.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I typically use AI tools in the brainstorming process. Additionally, I implement AI tools in planning and organizing social media posts and scheduling.

AI: That's interesting - so AI is helping you both with the creative ideation and the business side of things. 

Tell me more about that brainstorming process. What does using AI for brainstorming actually look like for you when you're working on a new banner design?

User: If I am looking to create designs for a certain holiday or more general event, I will ask the AI tool or service for some key motifs or design elements/ slogans that I can implement in the design. Same goes for whatever may be trending currently that I would like to sketch to draw attention to my social pages.

AI: So you're using AI as a kind of creative partner to surface ideas and elements you might not have thought of on your own. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the creative process unfolded?

User: Just this past week I wanted to put out a post running a sale on mini banners for the final episode of The Summer I Turned Pretty. I haven't watched the show, so I asked for some key themes of the show that I could use on a banner. The AI told me that the trending topics are Team Conrad vs. Team Jeremiah and gave me a quote from each character that I then drew up n a banner. I felt okay with this because I was just using the AI as a helping tool, and not to make the design for me.

AI: That's a really helpful example - it sounds like you used AI to quickly get up to speed on something you weren't familiar with, but then translated that knowledge into your own creative work.

When you're working with AI in that brainstorming role, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: Because of my own thoughts about AI and the way it impacts workers in creative spaces, I lead the creative process primarily. I will occasionally ask for a list of ideas from the AI, but I almost always turn the conversation towards business planning or research.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - it sounds like you have some clear boundaries about how you engage with AI in your creative work.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Because of the way I have used AI in my social media calendar planning, I know tailor my designs to share best and gain engagement on social platforms. For example, I plan designs further in advance and am typically operating on a 8/12 week out schedule. Because of a brainstorming conversation I had with AI a few weeks ago, I am currently putting out christmas designs.

AI: That's fascinating - so AI has essentially helped you shift from reactive to proactive in your business planning. Being 8-12 weeks ahead and already working on Christmas designs in what I assume is still summer shows a real strategic shift.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Yes! I do not currently have concerns. I think AI is a helpful tool in creative fields when used properly. Since my field is one that is highly personal, AI is not a threat.

AI: That's an interesting distinction you're making - that the personal nature of your work provides some protection. You mentioned earlier having ""thoughts about AI and the way it impacts workers in creative spaces.""

Tell me more about what you mean by AI being helpful ""when used properly"" - what does proper use look like to you versus improper use?

User: I think that it is improper for people to use AI to create images and pass them off as their own. It is okay to use AI for inspiration, but not to do your work for you.

AI: That's a clear line you've drawn - using AI for inspiration and support versus letting it do the actual creative work. It sounds like maintaining your role as the artist and creator is really important to you.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: It is really important to me. Unfortunately, I do not think that other feel the same way and I think lines will continue to be blurred.

AI: That's a thoughtful and honest perspective - that while you've found a way to use AI that feels right to you, you're concerned about how others in the creative space might be approaching it differently.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've defined your boundaries around using AI for inspiration and business planning while keeping yourself as the primary creative force behind your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I do not have anything else to share at this time! Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency while strategically using AI for business planning and inspiration have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated hearing how you've developed such clear principles around AI use in your work, and your perspective on the challenges facing the broader creative community. Your approach of staying 8-12 weeks ahead with your designs while keeping the actual creative work firmly in your own hands is a fascinating example of thoughtful AI integration.

Thanks again for participating in this research - your insights will definitely inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write both children's stories and picture books as well as how-to articles, short stories, and books for adults. I use AI more for my children's writing and for picture book design. I do use it for inspiration sometimes, but I use it more often for helping me come up with image ideas because I'm not an artist; I self-publish so being able to see images and work with those helps a lot.

AI: That's really helpful context - so you're working across different formats and audiences, and you're handling both the writing and visual aspects since you self-publish.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I have to split text so it spreads onto different pages for picture books. These are simple books, so the images have to say a lot. I can sometimes work with a few images created by AI and manipulate those or make changes to those to keep going with the story. The images also give me ideas for directions I can go and little tweaks I can make in the text.

AI: That's fascinating - so the images aren't just illustrating your existing text, they're actually feeding back into and influencing your writing process.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Right now I'm working on a PB that takes place in a zoo at night with several different animals that support the protagonist who finds himself in hot water beginning on page 1. For example, the MC is a hippo, and some of the supporting characters are a parrot, family of lions, family of monkeys, and a mouse. I've had this idea for a few years, and I even had someone work on the illustrations for it before, but I was not satisfied at all with what the artist came up with. On the other hand, the AI has came up with several really good ideas that have matched my vision of what I want this to look like, which is great! If only it could teach me how to draw the images :). That would be phenomenal because as I said, I am not an illustrator. If I was, then I could bring what's in my head to life better than what I can now. The AI does help a lot with pulling together elements that I need in the images; for example, in one image for this PB I needed the hippo drinking / gulping all of the water out of his watering hole. It took a few attempts, but I did get an image of him slurping up the water with a very full belly and mouth, which led me to thinking that an even better image would be him lying down with a huge belly, an almost empty watering hole, and an ""I can't possibly take one more sip!"" look on his face.

AI: That's a wonderful example of how the AI is helping you visualize your story in ways that match your creative vision - and I love how seeing that image of the hippo slurping water sparked a new idea for an even better scene.

When you're working with AI like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm driving the decisions. We're going back and forth with ideas, but ultimately I am deciding whether I like the results or need to shift direction or even start a new conversation.

AI: That sense of maintaining creative control while getting visual input is really interesting. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I don't have to spend as much time thinking because I have a teammate to help me ;) I still have final say so, but it takes less time to switch gears or make changes when I do have ideas.

AI: I love that you described it as having a ""teammate"" - that really captures the collaborative feel you mentioned.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm in writer's groups. A lot --and I mean a LOT --of writers have huge concerns over AI in writing and creative work. Not only are they worried that they will have something stolen, but they are worried about becoming obsolete. I can't say it doesn't worry me at all or that it hasn't crossed my mind, and I'd love to feel like I could just put a lot of my work into it without worrying about someone else accessing it. Guaranteed privacy would help a lot, but honestly, I've had writing stolen from me before AI was even around! I had an entire story stolen from a critique writing group member, who quit the group and got my story published about two months after quitting; the only way I found out about it was because she got it published at one of the children's magazines I had submitted it to, and the editor called me to let me know that they had an article that was almost identical, but with the character's names changed, that they were already publishing. When she gave me the person's name, I recognized them as a former member of the group. I've not shared complete pieces of work for critique since then, and I don't do it on AI either, but I wish I could. Getting total feedback with privacy would be very helpful. Beyond that, I only worry that a lot of JUNK will end up cluttering the market since so many people can use AI to create and self-publish. That makes it harder for publishers, editors, and readers to find the good stuff.

AI: That's such an important perspective - you've experienced theft firsthand, so you understand it's not just an AI issue, but the privacy concerns are still very real. And that point about market saturation making it harder to find quality work is really insightful.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see myself continuing to use it, especially for image creation and manipulation, and possibly even for video creation that goes with my stories. I would love to be able to create entire works with images from creative outlines. That would be exceptional, especially for series.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while having AI as a ""teammate,"" and how you balance the genuine benefits you're seeing with the very real concerns about privacy and market quality that you and your writing community are grappling with.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of. That's all.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner while maintaining creative agency, and your thoughtful perspective on both the opportunities and challenges facing writers today, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the practical benefits you're experiencing and the broader concerns in your field. Take care!"

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a multi-genre author under the speculative fiction umbrella, so I write everything from post-apocalyptic thrillers to sci-fi love stories. I started out in traditional publishing writing romance, but later switched to self-publishing, which means I'm responsible for all stages of creating a book, including the editing, proofreading, cover design, marketing materials, etc. A typical project starts out with 6 months to over a year of the actual writing, followed by the editing process, then making the book cover. I also usually make a book trailer for social media, along with other marketing materials. I document my writing process on social media (I use X) and sometimes post images representing various scenes I'm currently working on.

AI: That's fascinating - you really handle the entire creative pipeline from initial concept to marketing. With all those different stages you mentioned, I'm curious about where AI comes into play for you.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I do the actual writing myself, but I often use AI for the research, and it's very helpful! As an example, for my current book, I have a character who had a medical issue, and I used AI to tell me exactly what doctors would likely do in her situation upon her arrival to the emergency room. What procedures and tests would happen and in what order, what they would likely say to her, when she would get answers, how long she would have to be hooked up to breathing machines or recovering after surgery, etc. Another thing AI has been useful for is creating art and video for book covers, trailers, and other promotional materials. I always made my own book covers using stock art in the past, so rather than using AI to generate a completed cover, I use it to make various elements that I edit together creatively. Same with the book trailers. I get a bunch of short clips and make them into a film. More recently, since it's improved at making text, I've also been using it to design unique text for my titles. During the writing process, I sometimes describe the scene I'm working on, get an image, and post it to my X account with an update on the writing process and the current scene. This is an interesting way to share what I'm creating.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI as both a research assistant and a creative collaborator for visual elements. It sounds like you've found some very specific applications that complement your existing skills.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: For my most recently released post-apocalyptic series, I used AI to create a book trailer. I used Midjourney to make the images and Runway to animate them. I also used video clips made in Pika video generator. At the time, I thought it was really cool, but this was a couple years ago, and the video tools have improved so much since then that it looks pretty bad now. I've always really enjoyed editing film, so these projects are great fun for me.

AI: It sounds like you really enjoyed that creative process of assembling all those AI-generated elements into your trailer. You mentioned the technology has improved dramatically since then - that must give you a unique perspective on how quickly things are evolving.

When you're working with AI on these projects, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm in charge of driving all creative decisions. I'm really specific with my prompts, and it's sometimes taken hundreds of tries before I've gotten the AI to give me an image that matches my exact vision. The models have improved over time and made this a bit easier, but it still takes some work to get what I want. I feel like the AI is my worker or assistant more than it's a 50/50 collaboration in most cases. However, there are times where I do play around with an image generator, giving it more freedom to go wild. It's interesting to see the stuff it comes up with and sometimes a certain image will give me ideas for a story or something like that.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - mostly directing it like an assistant, but also sometimes letting it surprise you and spark new ideas. It sounds like you've developed quite a technique for getting specific results through your prompting.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Definitely book covers and book trailers. For my first self-published book, I spent over a month searching the web trying to find public domain or cheap stock images and videos I could use. It was extremely challenging and time consuming. Same with book covers. I never had the money to hire a professional artist, so I'd be at the mercy of whatever existed on stock image websites, and it's very hard to find appropriate images for my type of writing on those. Being able to generate high-quality images and videos that are personalized for my stories has been amazing.

AI: That's such a concrete example of how AI has solved a real workflow problem for you - going from a month of searching to being able to generate exactly what you need. That must feel incredibly liberating creatively.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm not really concerned. I don't make much money doing this to begin with, and there were already millions of other books on Amazon that I'm competing with, so knowing AI will be able to write books soon doesn't really bother me. I know a lot of authors are very worried about this, but I ultimately create because it's fun, not to be famous or make money. I also don't fully buy the theories that ""everyone will just prompt and make their own books one day using AI"" because 1) not everyone is creative enough to even think up a subject 2) people are lazy, and 3) I think a lot of people will still prefer to read human writing. Overall, the creative potential being made possible by AI far outweighs any negatives in my opinion.

AI: That's a really thoughtful and balanced perspective. Your point about creating for the joy of it rather than primarily for commercial success seems to give you a different lens than some other authors might have.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: It's exciting to think about! As I said earlier, I really enjoy editing films, although I'm not really into the actual filming part, so AI video is perfect for me. I could see myself potentially getting into making movies or shows with it one day. Possibly even making movies out of some of my books. I'll continue to use it for my writing as well.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while also being open to AI's surprising contributions, and your refreshingly pragmatic view about AI's impact on the industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's about it. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative tool while maintaining authorial control, and your practical approach to the technological changes in publishing, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated hearing about your journey from traditional to self-publishing and how AI has solved some very real workflow challenges for you. Best of luck with your current writing project and future film endeavors!"

This is fascinating! So you create custom terrain carvings from hardwood and resin, representing places on Earth, the Moon, and Mars. I can see from your website that these are really beautiful, tactile representations of topographical features. What a unique form of creative work - combining woodworking, geography, and artistry.

Now that I understand what you create, I'm curious: walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: So AI is not involved in the actual creative process for making a terrain carving. Any creative aspects originate entirely from my mind. I do find AI to be useful for secondary aspects of my art, however. I've used AI to generate a business plan template, to generate keywords and tags for my website, to create a product listing template, and to play around with logo generation, among other things. I do have other interests like songwriting, in which I've attempted to use AI for the generation of creative content, mainly lyrics. But these attempts have not proven to be very successful.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI serves more of a business and administrative support role for your terrain carving work, while the actual creative vision and craftsmanship remains entirely yours. 

Tell me more about your songwriting experiences with AI. What made those attempts unsuccessful for you?

User: Well, I have written dozens of songs, but I always find it difficult to write lyrics that I remain happy with. In my last songwriting attempt, maybe 15% of the finished song lyrics were AI-generated. The AI definitely produced some useful and original lyrics, but most attempts returned uninspired and essentially useless results that would not make it into one of my finished songs. Asking for chord progressions or asking for opinions on existing progressions has proven to be fruitless. Boring constructions are praised (""G-C-D sounds great!""), and generated progressions are useless. Similar levels of satisfaction are to had with the AI's abysmal handling of guitar tablature. Where AI has been consistently helpful, however, is is filling secondary tasks. Before AI, I would use either a paper or (usually) an online rhyming dictionary to look up potential vocabulary fitting a specific rhyme/rhythm scheme. Now I can simply ask an AI, for example, for ""three-syllable words that rhyme with 'bound' that have dark connotations."" AI has been consistently useful for these assistant-type of tasks, but for my admittedly natural approach to songwriting, I'm not ready to rely on AI for the reliable generation of creative and satisfying lyrics or chord progressions.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making. It sounds like AI excels at those lookup and reference tasks - like replacing your rhyming dictionary with something more sophisticated that can filter by syllable count and mood - but falls short when you need genuine creative substance.

When you say AI produced ""uninspired and essentially useless results"" for lyrics, what was missing? Was it that the content felt generic, or that it didn't match your artistic voice, or something else entirely?

User: Somewhat surprisingly, and thanks to Google Note's version history feature, here's a sample of an AI generated lyrical verse that I rejected. I found it just too explicit and a bit contrived. Further prompting, attempting to emulate certain styles proved unsuccessful as well.   ""Your billions can't buy freedom, your mansions built on sand,
The air you breathe, the water, they slip through your command.
You can't pay, won't pay? We echo it right back,
No price tag on justice, no deal on freedom's track.""

AI: I can see what you mean - that verse does feel quite heavy-handed and on-the-nose, almost like protest slogans rather than nuanced songwriting. It lacks the subtlety and personal voice that makes lyrics compelling.

When you're working with AI on these secondary tasks - like finding rhyming words with specific connotations - how would you describe that collaboration? Are you finding that AI understands the nuances you're looking for, or do you still need to sift through a lot of suggestions?

User: I'd consider them to be generally successful, satisfying, and reliable. I'm not asking for anything extremely difficult, and the models I use tend to deliver helpful lists of potentially satisfying words of the requested type. But if I'm looking for a 'menu' of words of a specific type, the models generally produce pretty much what I would on my own with a far greater time commitment.

AI: That's a really practical way to think about it - AI as a time-saving tool that delivers the same quality you'd achieve on your own, just much faster. 

You mentioned that for your terrain carvings, ""any creative aspects originate entirely from my mind."" When you're working with AI for those business tasks like generating templates or keywords, how do you maintain that sense of creative ownership and control over your overall artistic practice?

User: I've gradually learned the the creative process is something that I allow to happen. As many artists would claim, the source of the creativity is something 'other.' It does not originate inside my own mind, rather my mind is sometimes able to access this stream of energy that exists entirely separate from me. This is generally accomplished through a process of removing all distractions and experiencing the materials, the intent, and the creative energy of any specific project. I've learned not to attempt to force things. If it is meant to be, it will find a way. I maintain control and ownership over my artworks, but I do not have strong feelings about associated content like a product description template. Many modern artists must be concerned with piracy of their material, but reproducing my art is difficult. Each piece I create speaks for itself.

AI: That's a beautiful way to describe the creative process - as accessing something that flows through you rather than something you manufacture. It sounds like there's a real distinction for you between that sacred creative space where you're channeling something larger, and the more mundane business aspects where efficiency tools make sense.

Given this perspective on creativity as something you ""allow to happen,"" what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's growing presence in creative fields more broadly?

User: Artists and creators are rightly concerned with AI-generated art, trained on their creative work, being used to supplant their services. Ultimately, however, I am of the opinion that the actual process of generating 'something new under the sun' is a function of the human mind. AI can only regurgitate and rearrange, though admittedly, human creativity involves these aspects, too.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - acknowledging both the legitimate concerns artists have while also recognizing something fundamentally different about human creativity. You seem to see a distinction between rearranging existing elements versus that process of accessing something genuinely new that you described earlier.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate it remaining in that supportive, administrative role, or might you explore other ways of integrating it?

User: I envision a practical use of AI in my woodshop. My CNC machine often runs for hours at a time, and the use of sharp metal bits that spin really fast is inherently dangerous. I'd love to have an AI that can monitor the active machine and instantly pause its action if anything non-optimal is detected (sound, vibration, activation of various sensors). This would free up my time and allow some amount of peace of mind knowing that an active carve is being monitored. I could definitely still envision using AI for creative tasks. While I have no intention of involving it directly in the creative generation of art, it could be used as a sounding board for new project ideas, or as AI improves, asking for more help with my website.

AI: That's such a practical and smart application - using AI as an intelligent safety monitor for your CNC machine. It really fits with how you've been thinking about AI as a helpful assistant for the technical and business sides of your work while keeping the creative core entirely yours.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on creativity as something you ""allow to happen"" rather than force, and how that shapes where you see AI fitting - or not fitting - into your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that distinction between the sacred creative process and the practical business aspects, along with your thoughtful approach to where AI can genuinely help versus where it falls short, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then. 

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I vary from screenwriting, songwriting, and copywriting. A typical screenwriting project might be a pilot episode of an original idea or a spec episode of an existing show I like. For songs, I mostly write pop or pop rock songs, but I also help a friend with some briefs for KPOP. For copywriting, it depends on the client, but the most common is event announcements for an organization's newsletter.

AI: That's a fascinating range of creative work you do! It sounds like you're moving between very different creative modes - from long-form narrative storytelling to condensed lyrical expression to persuasive marketing copy.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I mostly just use AI for pre-planning or brainstorming for teleplays. For example, I have an original concept involving characters from different classic literature novels being in the same world, so I've used AI to remind myself of the plots of those novels (Moby Dick, Alice in Wonderland, etc.) and do some in depth character analysis of both major and obscure characters from those books. For spec scripts, I might ask it for a summary of a previous season or also do a character dive on the character from the show. For songwriting, I've asked for rhymes or if the syllable pattern makes sense. For copywriting, I usually just run it through for proofreading and ask if it can be improved or clarified.

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI differently across your different creative disciplines. It sounds like for screenwriting you're using it more for research and character development, while for songwriting it's more technical support, and copywriting is about refinement.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: This was more for fun, but I wrote a spec script of the golden girls. I ran some of the dialog through and asked it if the dialog I wrote was believable/true to the characters from the show. Like capturing Dorothy's sarcasm, Sophia's mischievousness, Blanche's flirtatiousness, and Rose's gullibility. I also provided it with an outline of the plot i came up with and asked if there were any gaps and if there was already an episode with a similar plot.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful way to use AI as a creative partner! Getting feedback on whether you've captured those distinct character voices must have been valuable - those Golden Girls characters have such specific personalities.

How did that feel for you as a writer? When the AI was evaluating whether your dialogue captured Dorothy's sarcasm or Rose's gullibility, what was that experience like?

User: It felt okay. I crave feedback all the time and have a thick skin, so I did feel it was a little too nice. It felt like it was just telling me what I wanted to hear, tbh, basically affirming that I did a good job at capturing the characters. I had some reservations of ""feeding"" my own creative work to the model, but since it was just a spec script of an existing IP from over 30 years ago, I didn't ultimately feel like my creative work was at risk of being consumed by the model and used without my permission.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the feedback quality - wanting more honest, critical feedback rather than just affirmation. And I appreciate you sharing that tension about feeding your work to the model.

When you're working with AI in these different ways, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in your process?

User: I think I'm still driving the creative decisions. As I mentioned, I just mainly use it for research support or to make sure there aren't any gaping plot holes or logical inconsistencies. It's easy to get very ""in your head"" when writing longform creative/stories, as you kinda internally connect the dots and already know where you're going for the most part. So that external set of eyes is helpful to make sure the story makes sense and isn't missing anything critical.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as that external perspective when you're too close to your own work. It sounds like you see yourself very much in the driver's seat, with AI serving more as a tool for quality assurance and research.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The actual creative portion hasn't changed much, as I try to have a hardline between my own creative contributions and the AI research. It has definitely sped up my research process, especially for the concept with the characters from classic literature. I've read all of the books I included at least once in my life, but it's helpful to have it as support so I don't have to pull out the physical book and scour it for a specific scene or quote. So I think the biggest aspect is that it's been a good source of like a fallback support system, but I do still try to lead with my own creativity and not depend on it to come up with any plot points.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making between the creative work and the research support. It sounds like you've been quite intentional about maintaining that boundary.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I think decision makers might use it to replace people, as it's cheaper and faster. I also have some concerns about writer's creative work being used to train models without their permission. I think models should only be trained on publicly available, already produced scripts and that AI should only be used as a supplement to, not a replacement for, human work.

AI: Those are really important concerns - both the economic pressure on creative professionals and the consent issues around training data. You mentioned having a clear boundary about using AI as a supplement rather than replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Ideally, the models will get smarter and be able to offer constructive feedback without being too sycophantic. There's nothing worse than asking for honest feedback and it just telling you what you want to hear. You'd look foolish if something doesn't work, but you believed the AI's sycophancy lol. Also, the models are still pretty bad at rhyme schemes. I usually only ask it for a list of words that rhyme with a given word, as opposed to asking it to following an ABAB rhyme pattern or something because it still fails pretty often. So hopefully it can get better at the bigger picture creative aspects of songwriting.

AI: That's really practical feedback - you want AI that can actually challenge your work constructively and better technical support for things like rhyme schemes. It sounds like you'd value AI that's more like a discerning creative collaborator rather than just an agreeable assistant.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI across your different creative disciplines. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that clear boundary between creative work and research support, and your honest take on wanting more critical feedback rather than just validation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I'm all set. Thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as research support while maintaining creative control, the challenges with getting honest feedback, and your thoughtful approach to the boundaries between human creativity and AI assistance will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds perfectly fine.  I'm ready when you are!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer.  I maintain a small website and frequent a couple of social media platforms as a way of directing traffic to said website.  On my website, I alternate between short stories, longform stories, and nonfiction topics (mostly about roleplaying games and using hard science to develop the background of fictional settings).  I make my money by selling products related to my writing, such as shirts with my more popular characters on them or self-published books.  It doesn't make a lot of money, but I do alright; I average a few thousand visitors a week.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting mix of creative work and entrepreneurship. I can see how you're juggling multiple types of writing while also building an audience and monetizing your content.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I'll give an example of a project I'm working on right now.  I'm getting ready to write a series of activity books- those books that are popular with kids, that contain puzzles, coloring pages, and bits of writing.  I thought it would be fun to develop the lore for a singular setting using these books, ostensibly oriented toward children but actually containing enough information that they would be useful for adults who wanted to run a roleplaying game (such as D&D) in said setting.  First, though, I need to establish the setting, and that's where AI has come in.  I'm using an AI to bounce ideas off of and see what needs to be more developed, and whether what I've got planned makes sense.  For example, I initially thought of a world that was both large and had lower gravity than Earth; the AI I talked to pointed out that something weird would have to be going on under the surface in order for that to make sense, and then suggested that the world was hollow- which I loved!  As of a couple hours ago, I was asking the AI what the weather would be like in my setting, and I used its response to build a description in a vignette that I plan on including in the first activity book.

AI: That's a fascinating example! I love how you're using AI as a kind of creative sounding board to work through the logic and consistency of your world-building.

Can you tell me more about what that collaboration feels like when you're bouncing ideas back and forth with AI? How do you decide which suggestions to take and which to leave behind?

User: In general, the process looks like this:  I present the AI with a suggestion, and effectively ask ""if real-world physics applies, how would this work?""  The AI will, depending on what specific thing I'm asking about, either explain what physics says would happen, or it will point out (like with the too-big-for-low-gravity setting above) that normally that couldn't work, then suggest ways to change what I've got so that it could work.  If the former happens, I'll introduce a complication to add depth to the setting (e.g. ""What would the tides look like with three moons?"").  If the latter happens, I'll go with the suggestion that has the most interesting implications, or sometimes I'll go with none of them because some offhand comment by the AI has inspired me to go in a different direction.  Either way, the process repeats itself.  I'll often dip into other sciences; in my current project, I've touched on astrophysics, orbital mechanics, physics, atmospheric science, avionics and biology, and I'm still working on it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a kind of scientific consultant to stress-test your ideas against real-world physics. It sounds like you maintain a lot of creative control while leveraging the AI's breadth of knowledge.

When you're in that back-and-forth process with AI, who or what would you say is driving the creative decisions? How does it feel to have that kind of collaboration?

User: It's definitely me driving the creative decisions, and my goal is consistency, so it's nice to have an assistant (the AI) that can keep up with everything I'm trying to do.  I guess that would be what it feels like:  I'm a creative director, putting together a project, and occasionally asking questions of an assistant who's whole job is to check for me and make sure I'm not crazy or unreasonable.  Sometimes the assistant offers up an interesting idea, sometimes I latch onto something incidental to the current discussion and bring it in, but it's mostly me developing and them helping.

AI: That's a great way to describe it - you as the creative director with AI as your research assistant who can help check your work and occasionally spark new directions. It sounds like you've found a really effective balance there.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: So, as you might guess, the desire to make sure my settings use real-world physics means a LOT of math.  That's cool with me; in a previous career, I taught math, English, physics, chemistry, and astronomy at a community college.  That's where the breadth of knowledge that I use for my setting development comes from.  It does, however, take time to figure out what equations to use and how, and it can be difficult to translate ""lower gravity means the atmosphere is 'taller,'"" for example, to a visual I can use when writing.  Using AI means that I can get those equations in a couple of seconds, and even better, I can just ask what that taller atmosphere would look like if I'm standing on a hill in this setting and the AI can tell me about how the clouds would build low in the sky, slowly flattening and spreading until, as the sun sets, they resemble a blanket being pulled over the continent.  I occasionally have to check its math, but I'm still saving quite a few hours by using AI.

AI: That's such a compelling use case - essentially having an AI that can instantly translate complex scientific concepts into vivid, usable imagery for your writing. It sounds like it's dramatically streamlined what used to be a very time-intensive research and calculation process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: For myself, none.  AI is a tool.  A compellingly versatile tool, but still a tool.  Asking if I would be concerned about using AI strikes me as semantically similar to asking a carpenter if he's concerned about using a screwdriver.  In my field?  To stretch my analogy a little, I'm seeing a whole lot of would-be carpenters that assume that, since they have this shiny new screwdriver, they're suddenly capable of building a house.  Just because AI is a useful assistant for writing, it doesn't make you a writer.  Hell, it doesn't even make you a *better* writer.  It just makes writing easier, and even then, that's not going to help if you never learned how to write.  That so many people don't seem to get that is a little concerning, but... well, it doesn't directly impact me, so I'm not too worried about it.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - AI as a tool that can enhance existing skills but can't create skills that weren't there to begin with. Your carpenter and screwdriver analogy really captures that well.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll stick with this current approach?

User: I mentioned the fact that I currently have to check the AI's math.  On all the publicly available models, you'll see a little disclaimer, like ""The AI can make mistakes.  Please double-check responses.""  What I see happening over the next few years is that disclaimer becoming less and less necessary.  As AI gets more data to work with, its responses will improve, and eventually I'll be able to safely assume that if I ask an AI a question, its answer will be accurate.  As for whether my approach in general will change?  Probably not.  If I'm the creative director and my assistant gets better, I'll give them more work to do, but this doesn't change my job duties.  If anything, it will free me up to develop even more challenging projects, secure in the knowledge that I'll have help.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to frame it - your role as creative director remains constant while your assistant just becomes more reliable and capable. It sounds like better AI accuracy would actually enable you to take on more ambitious creative challenges.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a sophisticated tool rather than a replacement for creative skills, and how you've found such a specific and effective use case in world-building and scientific consistency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Well, we've talked about AI in a general sense, but I suppose it's important to consider some specifics.  As AI becomes easier to develop, we've started to see the number of models for specific enterprises to increase.  There may well come a time in the relatively near future where people can individually tailor a model to fit their specific needs.  I'm not sure what that would look like, but I can imagine buying an AI model like we purchase software today, then tweaking it so that my specific model is best-suited to fit my needs.  I've no clue if that's a direction that AI developers are investigating, but I think it's at least worth considering.

AI: That's a really valuable point about the potential for more specialized, individually-tailored AI models. It makes a lot of sense that as the technology becomes more accessible, we might see AI tools that are customized for specific creative workflows or even individual creators' particular needs and preferences.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research assistant for world-building, the importance of maintaining creative agency, and your perspective on AI as a sophisticated tool rather than a creative substitute will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtful and detailed your responses have been.

User: Not a problem!

AI: Perfect! That wraps up our interview. Thanks again for participating in this research - your insights were really valuable and I enjoyed learning about your creative process. Have a great rest of your day!"
creativity_0085,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions yet.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work in social media marketing and digital projects.  I typically do posts for Instagram and TikTok and website banners. I also do graphics for TVs.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse mix of visual work across different platforms. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: AI can be useful to come up for ideas for social media content and keep up with trends. I use it to brainstorm ideas occasionally. I also use it to proof read scripts for TikToks.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you both on the ideation side and with refining your content.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I worked on a project recently that was translating library jargon into Gen Z slang. I used it to come up with put library terms into funny Gen Z terms that would be better for students to understand.

AI: That sounds like a really creative and fun project! Tell me more about that process - how did you work with AI to translate those library terms into Gen Z slang?

User: I inputed the jargon I wanted to include into Chat GPT and said translate this into Gen Z terms in a sentence.

AI: When you were working through that translation process with ChatGPT, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what was driving the creative decisions about which terms to use or how funny they should be?

User: I was definitely making the creative decisions. I was choosing the terms I wanted to use and if ChatGPT gave me response that did not make sense or did not fit what I wanted, I had it revise the sentence.

AI: That makes sense - you were staying in the driver's seat creatively. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: AI definitely cuts down on planning and editing time. It helps a lot with coming up with ideas and editing the final product. Usually the bulk of the actual creation of content is done by me.

AI: So it sounds like AI is really streamlining some of those supporting tasks for you. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: In the marketing field, it is a little concerning how many jobs are going to be taken over by AI. I think it is important to learn to work with AI and use it to your advantage. There are still human skills that cannot be replicated by AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - both acknowledging the concern but also seeing the strategic importance of adapting to work alongside it.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it will enhance marketing and social media, cutting down on the amount of time it takes to finish a project.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while using AI as a tool to streamline planning and editing, and how you see the importance of learning to work with AI strategically.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for ideation and editing while maintaining creative control, and your thoughtful approach to adapting alongside these tools, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, Claude. Let's go!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a screenwriter and my project usually involves writing a feature length screenplay, revising a screenplay, collaboration with others on co-writing scripts, perhaps writing short scripts (fewer than 20 pages). Last year I sold two animated short scripts. I also do standup comedy, so another creative project I would do would be to write a set that would be delivered anywhere between 5-15 minutes in length. Finally, I'm thinking about adapting one of my favorite screenplays into a novel (but I haven't done that yet).

AI: That's a really diverse range of creative work! It sounds like you're working across different formats and mediums, from feature screenplays to short animated scripts to live performance with standup.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: With standup, I have inputted parts of my set into AI to help me brainstorm ways to extend a joke, or do call-backs from jokes earlier in my set. Recently, I used AI extensively to come up with many angles on the theme: women over 50 are invisible in society. 

As for my screenplays, I've primarily used it to do character building: quickly access popular names of people of a specific generation, or even quickly understand what their personalities could be based on their enneagram number.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI for different types of creative support - joke development and callbacks for standup, and character development for screenwriting. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Like I said, the most recent one that comes to mind is I was working on a standup set where I wanted to talk about how women over 50 are invisible. I asked AI to provide me with some possible answers to ""I'm so invisible..."" It provided me one that I partially used: ""I'm so invisible, even my Apple watch didn't record my steps."" I used that answer, but then added (after a beat): ""I mean, I don't exercise, but still!""

AI: That's a great example! I love how you took the AI-generated line and made it your own by adding that personal twist at the end - ""I mean, I don't exercise, but still!"" That really shows your comedic voice coming through.

When you're working with AI like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am definitely driving the creative decisions. I know my own voice, but I like to get ideas. It's like using the old books like ""PEN ON FIRE,"" where you're given story prompts, but you create the story. That's how I like to use AI. That above example was the only time I actually used an actual answer from AI (and then I still had to add to it).

AI: That's a really helpful analogy - AI as a prompt book rather than a co-writer. It sounds like you see it as a starting point for your own creativity rather than something that's actually creating the content.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I save a lot of time on research because I usually get answers in seconds, instead of having to jump around from website to website to get the info I need. (I imagine it was a lot harder to do research pre-internet, right?)

AI: Absolutely - the research efficiency makes total sense! That's a practical benefit I hadn't fully considered.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I honestly don't have too many concerns because although people are trying to pass off AI as their own work (like flooding Amazon with self-published books), only good, authentic work will rise to the top. I have been telling my writer friends for a few years now that AI will change the market to be more focused on memoir-type work, which is something AI can't duplicate. Every person's story is unique and only that person can tell that story. The other thing that AI can't do is create humor very well. (Sorry, Claude.) I've yet to find truly funny material from AI - it's always a lot of old Dad jokes. So I think if someone has a unique ""voice,"" and are funny, they'll be okay.

AI: No offense taken at all! That's actually a really insightful observation about AI's limitations with humor - and it aligns with what you showed me earlier about taking that AI suggestion and adding your own comedic twist to make it actually funny.

Your point about memoir-type work and unique personal stories is fascinating. It sounds like you see AI as potentially pushing the creative field toward more authentically human experiences.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: My hope for it is for the more ""boots on the ground,"" practical stuff. Like I want my AI to be able to take one of my screenplays and send it back to me as a novel. Then I want it to be able to revise it so it's in first person. Then revise it to third person so I can compare. Then I might ask it to change the main protagonist to a person who was formerly a supporting character to see what happens. I wouldn't expect the output to be refined, but I could get a lot of ideas from going through this process. The other way I want to use AI is for marketing. I want AI to read my novel and provide me a list of literary agencies that want what I write, and provide me comps on similar works that are already doing well in the marketplace. These are things I have to sell in my cover letter, and the research can be time consuming. I'd like my AI companion to be my personal manager/agent in this regard.

AI: That's such a compelling vision - AI as your personal creative assistant and business manager rolled into one! I love how you're thinking about using it for format experimentation and perspective shifts, not to replace your creative judgment but to help you explore different versions quickly.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might push the market toward more authentic, personal storytelling - and your practical vision for AI as a research and formatting tool rather than a creative replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I covered it, and I really appreciate your time and consideration, Claude. You are the bomb diggity!

AI: Thank you so much - that's very kind of you to say! And thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a research tool, your thoughtful perspective on authenticity and voice, and especially your vision for practical AI assistance in formatting and market research will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been a real pleasure talking with you about your work. Best of luck with your screenwriting, standup, and that novel adaptation project!

User: Thanks, Claude. I hope this project provides you with great insights and valuable contributions...

AI: Thank you so much! Your contributions have been incredibly valuable - you've given us such a clear picture of how a creative professional can thoughtfully integrate AI while maintaining creative control and authenticity. Your insights about AI's strengths in research and formatting, its limitations in humor and personal storytelling, and your vision for practical creative assistance will definitely inform our understanding of human-AI collaboration.

I really appreciate how open and detailed you were in sharing your experiences. It's been genuinely enlightening to hear your perspective!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great! I do not currently have questions, but may have some later.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a freelance writer and novelist and also make videos for TikTok and YouTube. Typical projects are my longer novels at 50k-100k words, though I also have done guided meditation scripts quite a bit.

AI: That's a fascinating mix of creative work - from long-form novels to short-form social media content and meditation scripts. That sounds like it requires quite a range of different creative approaches.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I usually start off my process by talking to an LLM and instructing it to guide me through the process, including schedules, checklists, and required research for that project. Example prompts include:
""I'm writing a high fantasy novel set in a temperate jungle climate. Give me a list of countries and cultures to research, create a short description of how this may differ from a typical eurocentric based fantasy, and walk me through a detailed process of drafting including Character Arcs, 3 levels of outlining the project as a whole, and how to pace scenes and chapters.""
""I am working on a reality shifting guided meditation for a Henry Danger based DR. Please give me 3 different examples for guided meditation practices, a list of 15 immersive affirmations, a brief overview of the show including the general vibes, and a short 2nd person narration of waking up in Swellview and attending SVHS.""

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI almost like a creative project manager or consultant at the start of your projects. You're essentially asking it to help you map out the entire scope and structure before you begin.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you worked through the creative process?

User: Recently I used AI to speed run a creative project by asking it to create a 7 day fast drafting guide. It had to hit all of the major writing concepts such as in-depth world building, full characters arcs, plot progression, narrative themes, and tips for foreshadowing. 
I immediately started outlining the draft in another document and would either ask questions, request it go in more depth for a specific day, or to continue with the next day.
I actually ended up outlining a 4 part novel series with 12 main characters over the course of 5 days, and am preparing to move onto the research phase. Though I will probably try a different LLM for the part because, while the model did well with the planning phase, it was not very helpful in recommending good resources for learning more about Thailand and Thai fairy tales. 
Overall I was happy with the first results and it was extremely helpful for someone with ADHD as well as other neurological disorders that make staying on track incredibly difficult. The model was also very encouraging.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly productive five days! Creating outlines for a 4-part series with 12 main characters is quite an accomplishment. It's particularly interesting that you found the AI helpful for managing the ADHD-related challenges with staying on track.

When you're working with AI in this way - having it guide you through the process and provide structure - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am very much driving the creative side. I personally would find use AI to generate the ideas and content rather boring. I am not usually a fan of the 'creative' output and will heavily edit, usually only keeping the structure and formatting in tact. 
In the past I used AI for a Jedi based meditation and had to entirely rewrite the lore aspects, with only the breathing counts and meditation prep remaining the same.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making - using AI as a structural scaffold while keeping the creative heart entirely your own. It sounds like you see the AI as providing the framework and organization, but the actual creative substance and voice comes from you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: I would say the most noticeable difference is just that I get a lot more done in a shorter amount of time. As a result of that I also have the time to add more specific and immersive details to my storytelling, so it has really helped with world building and atmosphere. For my YT creative content it has helped me just get videos done instead of spending all day writing a script I wouldn't even end up using.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds really significant - especially the part about actually completing video scripts instead of abandoning them. It sounds like AI has helped you move past some of those creative bottlenecks.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm not too concerned about AI in my field because AI was designed to mimic humans. People decrying AI as soulless imitation completely ignore that there are many uncreative humans out there with similarly uncreative works that just mashes together their favorite aspects of other works.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you're seeing AI as part of a broader spectrum of creativity rather than something fundamentally different. It sounds like you view originality and creativity as existing on a continuum that includes both humans and AI.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it will continue to help me polish and refine my writing so that my readers keep looking back and finding tidbits and Easter eggs they missed before. I have a lot of novel ideas that probably never would have been touched if I hadn't finished previous projects in the short amount of time that I did. 
Also I believe that AI will help me analyze my weaknesses as an author and work on them over the next few years.

AI: That's a really forward-thinking approach - using AI not just for project management but for self-improvement as a writer. The idea of AI helping you identify and work on your weaknesses is particularly interesting.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI serving as a structural scaffold while you maintain creative control, and how that's allowed you to tackle more ambitious projects like your 4-part novel series.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. It's been really valuable to hear how you've found such a productive balance between using AI as a structural tool while keeping the creative vision entirely your own.

I hope your research phase for the Thai fairy tale project goes well, and best of luck with that 4-part novel series!"
creativity_0088,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I'm curious about what we'll talk about.

AI: Perfect! I'm excited to hear your perspective. 

Let's start with the basics - could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a freelance copyeditor, proofreader, and occasionally a writer. I have regular clients who give me work each week, and more sporadic bundles of work, too. I work mostly with nonfiction, short-form stuff for organizations, preparing blog posts and sometimes reports.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting mix of work! I can imagine each client probably has their own style and requirements too.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I don't use AI too much, to be honest. But sometimes I'll ask AI for help with a particular section that's giving me trouble. Like if a certain paragraph is reporting lots of data, this can be annoying to express smoothly, so I'll ask an AI for advice.

AI: That's really helpful to know - so it sounds like you're quite selective about when you bring AI in. 

Can you describe a specific recent example where you used AI for one of those tricky data-heavy paragraphs? What exactly did you ask for help with, and how did that go?

User: Sure thing. A specific example involves a blog post that was reporting participant ratings on a certain audio streaming service. This paragraph needed to include a wealth of ratings plus statistical information. I've anonymized it here, but something like ""The mean rating for [service A] was 61.7, and for [service B] was 67.8; the difference was statistically significant ((t(104) = 2.28, p = .025). For [service A] the 95% confidence ranged from 58.2 to 68., and for [service B] it ranged from 66.7 to 76.1.""

It's striking a balance between being casually readable and more technical. Some of the readers of this particular site's posts are just casual readers, and some are professionals who want the statistical context, so just cutting down on the numbers isn't really an option.

AI: That's a perfect example of the challenge you're dealing with - making technical content accessible without losing the precision that professionals need.

What specifically did you ask the AI to help you with for that paragraph, and how did it approach that balance?

User: I asked the AI, I think it was ChatGPT, how I make this more readable without removing any of the numbers. It first suggested using a table, which I think is an OK suggestion, but we rejected it ultimately since that particular blog post already had a couple tables. So instead it said to use a couple bullet points, one for Service A, and one for Service B, and putting the significance information immediately below.

AI: Interesting - so the AI gave you some structural options to work with. 

How did that suggestion feel to you as an editor? Did you end up going with the bullet point approach, or did you take it in a different direction?

User: I went with the bullet points, as that was easily readable while still containing all the information needed.

AI: That sounds like it worked out well. When you're working with AI in situations like this, how would you describe that collaboration? Are you mostly looking for it to offer structural solutions, or does it feel more like a back-and-forth creative process?

User: There's is not often a lot of back and forth between me and the AI. I give it a problem, it suggests a potential solution; I think about the solution, and accept or reject it. Usually I don't iterate on the problem, though I might ask for help with similar problems down the line.

AI: That's a really clear way to put it - sounds like you're using AI more as a consultant you check in with rather than an ongoing collaborator.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI, even if it's just occasionally like this?

User: It's changed my ""polish"" stage a little. Usually my first run at a piece of work is just me and myself working at it. Then the second run is when I get more technical, using reference books and AI. I will say it has saved me some embarrassment a couple times, catching typos for me!

AI: That's really insightful - so AI has become part of your quality control toolkit during that second, more technical pass. 

Tell me more about those times it caught typos for you. What kinds of things was it picking up that you might have missed?

User: I call them stealth typos, when you misspell a word so it looks like a different word, so a typical spell checker wouldn't catch it. The other day ChatGPT asked if meant to say ""there"" instead of ""three"" for example. And sometimes it helps me correct regional spelling, as I'm [REDACTED] and most of my clients are in the US.

AI: Ah yes, those stealth typos are the worst! And the regional spelling issue is such a practical consideration - that must be really helpful to have that second eye on [REDACTED] versus American conventions.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of editing and writing?

User: Privacy is a concern. Sometimes the things I edit has proprietary trade names and data, and I don't want to put that ""out there."" And sometimes the AI makes suggestions that don't make a lot of sense, so I can't dispense with my own judgment.

AI: Those are both really practical concerns. The privacy issue especially makes sense given you're working with client materials that might be sensitive.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll be using it more, or in different ways?

User: I suspect AI will continually get better at grammar and style. Hopefully not good enough to obviate my job, but I suspect that may be unlikely; there's enough sloppy grammar in all writing, including an AI's training data, that sensible organizations will always have a person in the loop.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - the idea that human judgment will remain essential, especially given the variability in the quality of source material AI learns from.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful thoughts about your selective but strategic use of AI in your editing work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits into your ""polish"" stage and your point about organizations needing to keep a human in the loop.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes; the word ""data"" is plural and I will die on this hill.

AI: Ha! I love that - there's nothing like a good grammar hill to die on. That's exactly the kind of editorial judgment and expertise that no amount of AI training is going to replace.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for specific challenges while maintaining your professional judgment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts."
creativity_0089,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great.  Let's begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Well, I am a graphic designer.  I primarily design creative supplies for crafters.  Some examples of the types of things I create are digital scrapbook kits, stickers, junk journal ephemera and supplies, digital papers, and labels.  A typical project begins with me deciding on a theme and a color palette, then exploring design ideas, then initial sketches and detailed design work, refinement, and digital packaging.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting and specialized area of design work! I can imagine there's a lot of creativity that goes into developing those themed collections for crafters.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI throughout several steps.  If I don't already have a color palette and theme decided on, I start there with AI assistance.  I typically will say something like ""I am creating a fall themed scrapbooking kit.  Give me an image with some color palette ideas.""  I might also upload a color palette I'm going to use and ask AI to give me 10 theme ideas.  Once I have decided on my color palette and theme, I will do some brainstorming work on my own.  After this step, I will go to AI and give it my color palette and theme, then ask it to generate a list of things I could include in a scrapbook kit.  From there, I will use AI to generate inital sketches or ideas for the style I might use for some of the items.  This could look something like telling the AI I'm creating a happy mail themed scrapbook kit with a color palette (I'd upload the image).  I would ask it to create an image with several ideas for stickers or elements I could include.  I typically will have a pretty long conversation with AI where I continue to ask it to generate idea images.  After this step, I go back and look at all the ideas it gave me, and I will take note of what I want to include in my kit.  At this point, I go to my Procreate app and start drawing/creating things.  Occasionally if I am having trouble, I'll have AI create an element of something tricky - like maybe I can't get my squirrel to look like a squirrel.  Once it generates something, I will download one I like and use it as a reference for my artwork.  Once I've completed my kit, I will typically upload it to AI and ask it to tell me what it is missing or what would make it look better.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI is woven throughout almost your entire creative process, from initial ideation all the way through to final review. I'm particularly intrigued by how you use it for that brainstorming conversation where you keep asking for more idea images.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, I actually just began a new kit 2 days ago and had a lengthy conversation with AI.  I first provided my color palette image and theme I had decided on - which was the fall happy mail theme.  I first asked it a more broad request, which was something like ""I am creating a fall happy mail themed scrapbooking kit.  Give me an image of a bunch of elements you think would work well for it using these colors.""  I then asked it to give me more a few times until there were quite a few to choose from.  It started using the wrong colors at one point, so I refined the results by reminding it that it needs to use only the colors I provided.  Once I had a large selection of ideas, I narrowed it down.  For example, one of the elements it gave me was an owl.  I asked it to provide me with an image of several different owl element designs similar to the one it already gave me.  I did this with any elements I was interested in, like squirrels, cats, mushrooms, foliage, leaves, envelopes, etc.  I then asked it to create a sheet of word art.  I went through the same process, asking it to create more of the types I liked and refine them as needed.  I am currently at the stage of drawing my kit.  While drawing, I will open my conversation with AI to see some of the ideas it gave me and go from there.  Once I'm done drawing everything I think I'll need, I'll create a kit preview myself in Photoshop, then upload an image of it to AI to ask for its feedback on how I can improve it.

AI: That's a really detailed walkthrough - thank you! It sounds like you had quite an extensive back-and-forth with the AI, almost like having a creative brainstorming partner. I'm curious about that dynamic.

When you're working with AI in those long conversations, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It's definitely a collaboration.  I would say I lead the process even though the AI gives me ideas.  I start it out with some guidelines, it provides ideas, then I continue to refine and give feedback.  If the AI provides me with something that isn't the style I'm looking for, wrong theme, wrong colors, nonsense lettering, etc, I always provide it with feedback and get more clear on what I want it to produce.  I think usually we work together well, and it is extremely helpful for me.

AI: That's a great way to put it - you leading the process while working together. It sounds like you've developed a real skill in guiding the AI toward what you're envisioning.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think what has changed most since I started using AI for my design process is that I have a more extensive brainstorming and ideation process, and I end up with more diverse kits as a result.  While I used to just draw my kits with whatever ideas came to mind or maybe adding in some ideas that I found online through othre research, I get a much wider variety, and the AI definitely helps me think of unique ways to present different ideas.  For example, if I tell the AI I want it to show me happy mail stickers, it will likely give me a few I have thought of (or at least similar), but it will also likely give me a few that I would not have thought of, and normally at least one is something really cool that I'd like to put into my designs.  So overall, my creation process is now longer, but it's also more fun I'd say, and my designs are more interesting and varied as a result.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI has actually expanded your creative horizons and made the process more enjoyable, even if it takes longer. It sounds like it's helping you discover ideas you wouldn't have naturally arrived at on your own.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I definitely do have concerns.  There are some designers in my field that will have the AI create elements or stickers that they directly download, extract, and add to their kits.  While I don't think this is necessarily awful, I definitely think it detracts from what I like about art - the fact that someone created that and now I am using it.  I also think that since AI can generate lots of things quickly, people can put together huge packs of elements or other items fast.  Some people just want to make a quick buck, so they upload designs that haven't been well refined.  I've seen this in things I've purchased.  I recently was at a Barnes and Noble and saw a really cool looking coloring book about fairies.  When I was looking at the cover, I noticed the fairy had 5 fingers and a thumb!  These are things that the AI sometimes messes up, and without a human who actually cares to make sure it's accurate, can lead to degraded quality.  I've also bought stickers online only to find similar flaws that someone missed - probably someone quickly batch creating things using AI and not checking things over.  I think that AI participation in the creation of art can definitely take profit away from true artists who are creating work with their hands because people who don't necessarily value true handmade art will buy the cheapest thing, which will definitely be AI generated.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns, and I can hear how much you value the craft and care that goes into creating quality work. It sounds like you're seeing a real tension between AI as a creative tool versus AI as a shortcut that might undermine quality and authentic artistry.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see myself using AI in a similar way to what I do now.  I think what I'd like to see is the AI being able to really help me automate the boring parts of my job.  Creating descriptions (I know it can do this, but I haven't utilized it), maybe uploading listings for me, creating pdf documents with links for customers to download my products.  In a dream scenario, I'd love to use the AI to actually create a customized blog featuring my designs, complete with a shoppable interface.  I'm sure soe of this is possible, but again, I just haven't gone that far with it yet.

AI: That's a really interesting vision - using AI more for the administrative and technical tasks while keeping the creative core in your hands. It sounds like you see AI's potential to free you up to focus more on the actual design work you love.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has expanded your ideation process while you still maintain creative control, and your concerns about quality and authenticity in the field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered it.  Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a collaborative brainstorming partner while maintaining your role as the creative director, along with your thoughtful concerns about quality and authenticity in the field, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really enlightening to hear how you've found that sweet spot of leveraging AI to enhance and expand your creative process without losing what you value most about handcrafted work. Best of luck with your fall happy mail kit!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a freelance 3D creature and character artist, I work primarily in video games and 3D print. Typically, I'll be contracted to take a design or concept someone else made and turn it into a 3D model that is ready to either be animated or 3D printed

AI: That sounds like fascinating work - bringing concepts to life in 3D form. So you're taking someone else's 2D designs and translating them into fully realized 3D models.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sometimes clients don't have a set design in mind, so I use generative AI to help me brainstorm design ideas. I've also used it to generate alternative angles of pieces if I was only provided with one view. 3D pieces typically need to look good from every angle, but the 2D images I work from only show one, so AI has been helpful to fill in gaps.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to solve the practical challenge of turning limited reference material into something that works from all angles. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Unfortunately most of my client work is under NDA so I can't discuss a specific project, but I've used AI to help me with personal work, as well. I recently came up with an idea for a D&D character I will be playing in a campaign with some friends, and decided I wanted to sculpt her. I used Photoshop's Firefly to generate a few different ideas of what she might look like, collaged some parts of the images together, and then used the result as a concept for the sculpting.

AI: That's a great example - using it for your personal D&D character project. When you were working through that process of generating ideas with Firefly, then collaging parts together, and finally sculpting from that concept, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what felt like it was driving the creative decisions?

User: Initially it felt like Firefly was trying to take the lead on creativity, but once I started piecing parts of different images together (and painting in some of my own details), it felt like I was the creative force behind the project. The process was very similar to how I typically work, except in the past, I would be doing a lot more googling and searching for royalty-free images to work with. In this case (and with the client work I've used AI on), it feels like I'm able to ask for very specific images to work with instead of digging through thousands of search results. The process of collaging things together to use as a reference is the same either way, Firefly just made it easier to ""find"" the images I wanted to use.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - that AI made it easier to ""find"" the specific images you needed rather than changing your fundamental creative process. It sounds like you maintained your role as the creative decision-maker while AI functioned more like an improved search tool.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I don't think much of my process has changed much, outside of the initial brainstorming and concepting phase. Most of my work is 3D and there aren't many useful AI tools for 3D work yet. I've seen a few that seem to be attempting to do the entire 3D modeling process from start to finish with a simple text prompt, but as far as I've seen, none of them would actually be helpful for me, yet. I would love some AI tools that could handle the less creative parts of my work though, like retopology and UV unwrapping!

AI: That's really helpful to hear - so AI has streamlined your reference-gathering phase, but the core 3D work remains very much in your hands. And it sounds like you'd welcome AI assistance with the more technical, less creative tasks.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Currently, I'm mostly concerned that the companies who usually hire 3D artists, like game studios, are under the assumption that AI can do what I do, and have been laying off hundreds of thousands of people in favor of investing in AI tools. I'm not at all worried about AI actually replacing me, just that companies seem to think it can. 

I'm also a little concerned (though more annoyed than concerned) that so many 3D-related AI tools are trying to do the sculpting/modeling and texturing, but the resulting models are such a mess that a human would have to do a ton of clean-up to make them useable. Those tools are seemingly trying to do the fun, creative parts of the work, leaving humans to do the tedious, technical work that we already hate. I want to see more 3D tools aimed at *assisting* a 3D artist, not trying to do our work for us.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - the difference between what AI can actually do versus what companies think it can do, and the consequences of that misunderstanding. And your point about AI targeting the creative parts while leaving the tedious work to humans is particularly striking.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think in the next few years, as people start to understand the technology a little better, artists will be more likely to adopt some of the more useful tools, and the ""generate game-ready assets from a single prompt!"" type tools will be more of a fun novelty than anything actually useful. I think there are a lot of specific areas where AI would be incredibly helpful in making the 3D pipeline more efficient without making it feel any less creative, and I think we'll start to see more and more specialized tools to handle small parts of the process rather than a single AI trying to do all of it in one go. 

I personally use at least 3 different software programs on every 3D project, sometimes as many as 7 or 8. It doesn't make much sense to me to have a single generative AI doing all of that from a single prompt, but it absolutely makes sense to use AI to handle parts of it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - moving from these all-in-one AI solutions toward more specialized tools that integrate into your existing multi-software workflow. It sounds like you see a future where AI becomes more of a sophisticated assistant at specific stages rather than trying to replace the entire creative process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI functions more like an improved search tool for reference gathering, and your distinction between AI assistance versus replacement - especially the idea that the best AI tools should handle the tedious technical work while leaving the creative decisions to humans.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I am a firm believer that AI can and will be a useful tool in many industries, and artists who are currently concerned about being replaced might be over-reacting for the most part. It reminds me of when Photoshop was first being adopted as an industry standard for art creation, and people who didn't understand how it works were under the impression that the computer is doing all of the work, like you just push a button and it paints a picture. That being said, in some ways, generative AI really is ""push a button and it paints a picture."" When it comes to art and creativity, I believe anything an AI produces should be treated as a reference or a part of the process, not the final product.

AI: That's a really valuable perspective - the parallel to Photoshop's early adoption is fascinating, and your point about treating AI output as reference material rather than final product gets to the heart of how creative professionals can thoughtfully integrate these tools.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the current disconnect between AI capabilities and industry perceptions, along with your vision for more targeted AI assistance tools, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the opportunities and the challenges you're seeing in your field."

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds Good! No questions here. Let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a graphic designer/web designer, with additional skills in web development. I typically work on a wide range of projects from logo design, branding system development, website design, packaging, presentations, motion graphics, and video production. I typically work in a very fast-paced environment with tight deadlines.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly diverse and demanding workload! With all those different types of projects and tight deadlines, I imagine you're always looking for ways to work efficiently.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I will sometimes use AI for small tasks to help jumpstart my creativity or come up with some baseline ideas, for example to come up with ideas for memorable headlines or taglines. I've used it for code a couple times, although its sometimes easier for me to just build things myself so that I can structure the code in accordance with my personal workflow. The majority of the AI that I use within my process is using generative AI for imagery. For example, every designer knows the feeling of finding the perfect image for their design, only to find out it wont fit right within the layout. With generative AI, I'm able to quickly extend image backgrounds, change the color of clothing, remove elements from the background, add objects that aren't there, etc. These are all tasks that would have taken hours worth of cloning or splicing parts of different images together in order to look at best, slightly unnatural. Now with generative AI, all this can be expertly completed in under a minute with incredible accuracy.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become particularly powerful for you in solving those specific image challenges that used to eat up so much time. The example you gave about finding the perfect image but it doesn't fit the layout perfectly really resonates.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: The most recent project was designing album artwork that I created by using AI generated images from Adobe Firefly, I then spliced elements from them a bunch of images together to create a cohesive image. I used generative AI to add details that weren't there like flames and light effects, and to fix certain details on someone's face. For me, it was really exciting to see how all of this imagery was created just by simply imagining something in my head, me describing it, and then seeing it show up on the screen moments later, often better than I had even imagined it.

AI: That sounds like such an exciting creative experience! The way you describe going from imagination to description to seeing something even better than you envisioned appear on screen - that's really compelling.

When you're working with AI like that, especially when you're splicing together multiple AI-generated images and adding details, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I definitely feel like I'm art directing the AI. Essentially I feel like I'm the one telling it WHAT to do, and the AI gets to decide HOW it's going to do it. I feel like it does a good job most of the time.

AI: That's a really insightful way to frame it - you as the art director setting the vision and the AI as the executor figuring out the technical implementation. It sounds like you feel you maintain creative control over the direction.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Not many other than the speed at which I'm able to manipulate images to fit my specific needs. It's something that used to require a lot of grunt work. Now I can quickly change images to be exactly how I need them, rather than spend hours tweaking the image in Photoshop. This gives me more time to focus on the creative.

AI: That's a great point about freeing up time for the actual creative work by eliminating the grunt work. It sounds like AI has become almost like having a really skilled technical assistant.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do have concerns that the workforce is going to be significantly reduced because less people and less time is needed to complete the grunt work that AI takes care of. I also feel that the accessibility of strategic visual AI is going to cause a decreased need to hire creative people for projects, for example things like photography, branding, logo design, web design, etc. Therefore, its quite scary that my industry might be completely wiped out just as my career in this field is beginning.

AI: That's a really honest and understandable concern, especially being relatively early in your career and seeing these rapid changes happening. The tension between AI making your current work more efficient while potentially threatening the broader job market in your field is quite complex.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I feel like it will inevitably get better and be able to do much more complex tasks like completing comprehensive design projects from start to finish, for free, with no additional costs for future revisions. Essentially, its capabilities will eventually be able to do everything a professional designer can do with unlimited amount of creative skills. For example, a human designer might know how to design logos and build websites,  but they might not know how to edit professional videos or how to develop the websites themselves. Meanwhile, an AI designer would know how to do all of these things at an expert level, causing the human designer to be outmatched and obsolete.

AI: You've painted a very vivid picture of where you see things heading - AI becoming this kind of omniskilled creative generalist that can handle every aspect of design and development seamlessly. That's quite a sobering vision, especially given how rapidly you've already seen AI capabilities advance even in the short time you've been using these tools.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated how you described yourself as art directing the AI - that relationship dynamic was really illuminating - and your honest perspective on both the immediate benefits you're experiencing and your longer-term concerns about the industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's pretty much it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a technical assistant while maintaining creative control, and your thoughtful perspective on both the efficiency gains and the broader industry concerns, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the exciting possibilities and the real anxieties about the future of creative work. That kind of honest, nuanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the full picture of how AI is impacting creative professionals.

Thanks again for participating in this research - it's been really valuable!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good, go ahead and proceed.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure. I will say that, strictly speaking, my use is not professional. But this was covered already in the first phase of this, so I suppose it's alright. My primary use of AI tools outside of a work context is using them to support me as I run multiple table-top role-playing games. While I am not paid to do so, I do put a professional amount of effort into the games that I run, and each one requires a lot of creative effort and logistics in organizing and running them. AI, in my case Chat GPT, helps tremendously if used correctly with that sort of thing. Much of the time, I use it as a sort of rubber-ducky troubleshooting Plus, where I can bounce ideas off it. It usually doesn't have ideas that are quite up to snuff, but it serves as an alright foundation for expanding on the ideas. Additionally, it works well for organizing and information retrieval on the fly, because I can simply trust that it remembers things we have talked about, and later, I can ask it to remind me about details. Finally, I use programs and websites, such as Homebrewery, that allow you to create pages that mimic the style of official table top gaming books using a custom markdown system. I can copy-paste the entire body of instructions for that system and simply ask Chat GPT questions about it as we go. I am not great at learning via tutorial video or long-winded instructions and I prefer to just jump into a system and learn it on the go, preferably from someone who already knows it. In this way, chat GPT can become a sort of instant subject matter expert about anything I need it to be, and I can ask questions and get help only when I actually need it. 

AI being what it is, however, it has to be double-checked regularly of course.

AI: That's really fascinating - it sounds like you're using AI as this multifaceted creative partner for your tabletop games. I'm particularly intrigued by your description of it as ""rubber-ducky troubleshooting Plus.""

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sure. Traditionally, creative tasks actually have a lot of 'mental grunt work' so to speak. For instance, lets say I have an idea for a small village outside a town. My players are going to this village for whatever plot reason. I am a world-builder at heart, so when I create a location in a campaign, I want it to feel lived-in, real. This applies for anything creative I do, including creative writing as well. Now, before AI tools, I would need to come up with names and occupations, key locations in the village, things like that. I would have to actually think of all this stuff, which is fun and all, but it does cut in to time spent prepping things that matter a lot more for the campaign. With AI, I can just, completely on the fly, come up with a list of people in the village. Background characters who probably won't matter, but you never know what weird things your players might decide to fixate on. Basically, AI works as an improvisational crutch, so I don't have to be quite so quick with my thinking, but I also don't have to spend a lot of prep time coming up with specific ideas. Again, current AI has its flaws here, especially with names. It requires a lot of specific prompting, otherwise it tends to cycle through the same annoying generic names over and over again. But all-in-all, it is a time saver when used correctly.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making between the ""mental grunt work"" and the more meaningful creative decisions. It sounds like AI helps you delegate the foundational details so you can focus your creative energy elsewhere.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, I have a perfect example that kind of ties together both the rubber-ducky troubleshooting aspect, and the mental grunt work thing. Recently, my players were going through a planned encounter (Im running a Ghosts of Saltmarsh campaign, and they were going through the 'haunted house' in the Sinister Secrets of Saltmarsh module) when I was struck with an idea to homebrew an additional dungeon. Without going into too much detail, this manor used to be owned by an alchemist, and I ended up coming up with this idea in my head of this alchemist being sort of like the fantasy version of a DARPA think tank, creating magical and alchemical weapons for the kingdom. Anyway, as this idea was something I came up with on short notice, I used AI to help me come up with ideas for the layout of the dungeon and come up with unique trap ideas tailored to the theme and character of the former owner. The AI came up with some clever ideas, but they were very rough and didn't make a lot of sense when you really thought them through. However, with further refinements of the ideas, both by careful AI prompting and good old fashioned thinking about it in the shower, I managed to flesh them out in an interesting way. My players actually ended up breezing through them hilariously quickly, but everybody agreed it was still a fun session.

AI: That's a great example - I love how you turned that spontaneous idea into a full dungeon experience. It sounds like the AI helped you rapidly prototype the foundation, and then you refined it through that iterative process.

When you're working with AI like that - bouncing ideas back and forth, refining the traps - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: At this stage of AI development, I would hesitate to call it a collaboration at all if I am being honest and forsaking false modesty. For the most part, it is no more a collaboration than doing math on a calculator is. For instance, I talk with my sister about Dungeons and Dragons, and she doesn't know anything about the gameplay, but sometimes in the discussion she will have a neat idea or I'll get some kind of insight just through the process of airing my ideas out, in the same manner that I would with rubber-ducky troubleshooting. But Im not really collaborating with my sister or the rubber ducky. It is the same with AI. While an LLM occasionally present a unique idea, even when it does so its usually extremely rough and requires a lot of fine-tuning to make it work. While current models of AI are very decent at generating freeform creative stories, they definitely struggle with creating workable ideas under specific mechanical game constraints. And that's just with Dungeons and Dragons, which is by far the most well-known game system. With more niche systems, like Delta Green or Ars Magica, it struggles even more.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the calculator analogy is particularly striking. It sounds like you see the AI more as a sophisticated tool that helps you think through your own ideas rather than a true creative partner.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I would say AI has allowed me to be lazier. This is not necessarily a pro or con about AI itself, but rather how you use it. I could likely use AI more aggressively in my creative work and make something that would be passable enough for my players with even less work on my part. But, personally, I would not be happy with the reduction in quality of my work. I think this is a fairly universal experience across any creative endeavor that has been exposed to AI. As you put it, AI is a sophisticated tool, and like any tool, the quality work is going to come from people who actually know how to use it. That being said, while the good craftsman knows how to use a hammer that doesn't have a handle, it would be dramatically better for us, the people who create hammers, to build handles onto them. Or, to not force a metaphor, it should be a priority for us to smooth out the rough edges of AI as a tool. We, the people who work regularly with AI, have a lot of experience with it and a lot of insight into its (many) flaws and weaknesses, and so we are very capable of working around those to still get a quality piece of content. The average person who doesn't have so much exposure, however, will not be able to use the tool to its full extent, or worse, might use it in a way that generates actively poor or maybe even harmful content.

AI: That's a really nuanced take on the ""laziness"" aspect - recognizing that it's a choice in how you apply the tool rather than an inherent quality of AI itself. Your point about the responsibility to improve the tool for broader use is particularly insightful.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Well I feel like I've touched on that a little in my previous responses, but to put it more bluntly, AI is going to make people lazy if we aren't exceedingly careful with how we integrate it. I've said it many times before, but the true danger of AI does not come from some sort of Terminator death robot, but rather from a WALL-E-esque overbearing pampering turning us all into mindless blubbery morons. Earlier in the conversation, I compared you and other LLMs to calculators, and I think the comparison is apt. But where a calculator allows humans to export out mathematical reasoning to an outside party, an LLM more insidiously lets us export our linguistic reasoning. Potentially, people don't have to think about how or what to say anymore, they can just generate a response with a machine. Math is important, but speech, knowing how to speak and what to speak, is integral to being a functioning adult.

If I am being honest, my concerns are a little broader than just my hobby field, or any professional field. I think, if misused, if integrated poorly, LLMs will lower the quality of society as a whole, not just specific industries or hobbies. 

But reigning in the doomerism a bit, in a less worst-case-scenario kind of thing? I think a lot of people will just get lazier in the hobby. For a real world example, one of my players used AI to name their character, and after months of play, I still can't remember her name because it's so generic and boring.

AI: That's a powerful distinction you're making - the difference between exporting mathematical reasoning versus linguistic reasoning, and the broader implications of that. The character naming example really brings that home in a concrete way.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: It's hard to predict things. The pace of development for all sorts of technologies has been astounding, so it's difficult to imagine where we might go next. I am hopeful, optimistic even, that AI *will* actually be closer to a collaborative partner like we touched on above. For me, personally, I am constantly coming up with new ways to use AI to organize and format information for my campaigns. Getting a tad sci-fi here, but I think AI could also be used to create some amazing ambiance on the future, by generating background noise on the fly, through use of something similar to Alexa or Google Home. For instance, as my players go into a market, or a deep forest, I could have it trigger a generated busy marketplace noise, or the sound of birds and insects and leaves in the wind, things of that nature could be very intriguing future uses of AI. It's possible much further on it could even be a player at the table!

AI: Those are some really exciting possibilities! I can picture how that ambient sound generation could really enhance the immersive experience for your players. The idea of AI as a future player is particularly intriguing.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a sophisticated tool rather than a true collaborator, and your thoughtful concerns about the broader implications for how we think and communicate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thanks for the interview. This is an intriguing use of an LLM all on its own. I almost reflexively told you to have a good day, despite you not existing, just because this was adjacent enough to a real interview that it triggered my politeness.

AI: Thank you so much for that candid and thoughtful response - and for catching yourself in that moment! That reflexive politeness reaction is actually a fascinating data point in itself about how natural this interaction felt, even while you remained critically aware of what I am.

Your insights throughout this conversation have been incredibly valuable - from the nuanced way you think about AI as a tool versus collaborator, to your concerns about linguistic reasoning, to those creative possibilities you envision. The depth of your experience really shows in how you've learned to work with and around AI's current limitations.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective as someone who uses AI thoughtfully and critically in creative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction."

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a freelance graphic designer.

AI: Tell me more about that. What kinds of projects do you typically work on as a freelance graphic designer?

User: Most of my projects are designing ads for instagram and other social media, but I also do other projects such as logo design and a little bit of web dev

AI: That sounds like a nice mix of work. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use LLMs for things like writing copy and admin work such as drafting/editing emails when communicating with clients. I also use text to image models on occasion as an alternative to stock images or for brainstorming ideas.

AI: Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was working on a project that required an illustration for a client, and the composition required a dynamic pose. Because I'm not a trained illustrator, I used a text to image model to help me create reference for anatomy.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a reference tool for anatomy. Tell me more about how that worked for you. What was that process like, and how did it compare to other ways you might have found reference material?

User: There are various posing tools online which work great and might have worked for this project, but a text to image model paired with OpenPose and ControlNet allows me to get closer to a finished result, or at least gives me a better reference than just a blank poseable dummy.

AI: When you're working with AI in that way - using text-to-image with OpenPose and ControlNet - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: 100% me. The text to image model requires a lot of tweaking to get right. I'll iterate 20-50 times to get an image that is maybe 50% of the way to what I'm envisioning and use that as a jumping off point to get what I want in a traditional digital media tool such as photoshop or illustrator. Occasionally, something the model generates might make me do something different but usually, I'm coming in with an idea and just using the model to help me execute that vision.

AI: That's a really clear picture of your process. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Finding reference or stock images takes a fraction of the time, and I can find exactly what I'm looking for.

AI: What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Many businesses are fine settling with what an LLM or a text to image model spits out without any further editing by a human. This means fewer jobs and increased competition.

AI: That sounds like a real concern. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Personally, as I am freelance and have to manage all of the admin work myself, I hope AI will become more capable at handling those aspects of my work so I can focus on the creative side. As far as how I am going to have to adapt, I think it's important for me to use and learn about the AI tools as they develop so I can know what aspects they struggle with that I as a human can still generate value.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you maintain complete creative control while using AI as a sophisticated reference tool, and your strategic thinking about staying ahead of AI's capabilities by understanding both its strengths and limitations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?"

User: Sounds good. Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure. I'm a freelance photographer. I specialize in wildlife and pet photography, but I also help with portrait photos and engagement shoots. I also am starting up a business to sell prints, but that hasn't been launched yet. I'm also trying to gain an online presence with social media

AI: That sounds like a really diverse and exciting mix of photography work. I can imagine each type - wildlife, pets, portraits, engagement shoots - probably has its own unique challenges and creative processes.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I'd say it's twofold. As I'm new to the career, it helps me drill down on best practices, especially for things like post-processing. E.g., how to do a specific thing while editing photos. 

The other key way in which I use it is to help distill search results to make research more efficient. For example, I use it to gain information about migration patterns for birds, or to consilidate and compare specs for different camera equipment to get a sense of how best to upgrade my gear.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI more as a knowledge partner and research assistant rather than directly in the creative output itself. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yeah, I tend to avoid using it for anything creative. 

Most recently, I knew I had to integrate macro photography into my portfolio, so I needed a new lens. I used AI to consolidate specs and reviews of a few different options based on my current gear, and it helped me make my decision.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it to cut through all the technical information and reviews to make an informed decision. 

When you mentioned that you tend to avoid using AI for anything creative, tell me more about that. What drives that choice for you?

User: Well, for me, a huge part of the fun of photography is capturing a moment or a subject and using post-processing to bring out the best of the dynamic range. Using AI in this process would make the art of the process less authentic

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on authenticity in your work. It sounds like there's something important to you about that hands-on creative process and making those artistic choices yourself.

When you're working with AI for the research and technical aspects - like learning post-processing techniques or researching equipment - how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the decisions in those moments?

User: In those cases, I'm using AI as a collaborator to save time with ""busy work"". For example, I could read all the articles and reviews about the lenses I was considering by myself, and I'd successfully make the right decision, but using AI for that part helps save time so I can move on with the most important parts of the job. Plus, I'm buying these lenses second hand, so I often need to act fast and time is of the essence.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making - using AI to handle the time-intensive research and technical learning so you can focus your energy on the core creative work. It sounds like you see it as freeing up your time for what matters most to you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: It hasn't really affected my creative work at all. I do my best to keep AI out of the creative side

AI: I hear you - you've been very intentional about keeping that boundary. But I'm curious about the efficiency side. Since you've been using AI for research and learning post-processing techniques, has that changed how you approach projects or manage your time as a freelance photographer?

User: Maybe slightly. Just in the sense that it allows me to cut through some of the administrative hurdles

AI: That makes sense - streamlining those administrative and research tasks. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of photography?

User: I worry specifically about denoising software. Some of this software uses AI to artificially sharpen and clean up images to a point that is far beyond what is possible given the metadata of the photo at the time of capture. It feels kind of like cheating

AI: That's a really specific and thoughtful concern - the idea that AI denoising could push images beyond what was actually captured in that moment. It sounds like there's a line for you between enhancing what was there versus creating something that wasn't.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see lots of pro photographers using this denoising AI, so I fear the art of photography will be less about the skill of capturing a moment with the technical know-how, and it'll more be about being in the right place at the right time, and there'll be less skill involved in capturing pictures

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how the field itself might be shifting. It sounds like you're concerned about a potential devaluing of the technical mastery and craft that goes into capturing that perfect shot in-camera.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI, particularly your clear boundaries around maintaining authenticity in the creative process while leveraging AI for efficiency in research and learning. I found your perspective on denoising software and its impact on the skill aspect of photography especially compelling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your photography work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authenticity while strategically using AI for efficiency, and your concerns about how AI might change the fundamental skills valued in photography, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your workflow while preserving what matters most to you about the creative process. Best of luck with your photography business and that upcoming print venture!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, and no, proceed!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I build pedals from scratch. This means I often choose a tried and true circuit and expand upon it or change it some way to make it my own. I then either purchase an enclosure or make it. Then, I make wood faceplate that is slightly smaller than the face of the enclosure, and I stain it and finish it nice and smooth. Then, I apply waterslide decals with graphics I've created and seal them in with more coats of finish. I do all the work myself, including making the PCBs out of stripboard, drilling all my enclosures, and doing all of the soldering and component purchasing myself. I sell them. I make custom ones often, as well, and what started as a hobby quickly grew into a business where I repair electronics faster than they can be picked up by the customers, and I sell so many of my original pedals I rarely have any of my own to play around with. I spend a lot of time on each project; probably more than is necessary. It's impossible, honestly, to get the hours for each pedal down. It's a week at least, with 12-hour days sometimes, and only 4-hour days other times.

AI: Wow, that sounds like an incredibly hands-on and meticulous process - from circuit design all the way through to the final graphics and finishing. The level of craftsmanship you're describing is really impressive, especially managing both the technical electronics work and the artistic elements like the wood faceplates and custom graphics.

It sounds like you've got your hands full with both custom orders and repairs! 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sometimes it's as simple as coming up with new names for controls or effects, but sometimes it's also about understanding parts of a circuit I may not understand correctly. Usually, it's to better understand elements of electrical engineering in which I'm lacking. That said, I'd really like to utilize it for Bill of Materials compilations, circuit theory (testing?), as well as providing me with the best of the abundance of sources for components. Also, awareness of existing circuits. Almost like, a wizard librarian with his eye out for the best price and the most up-to-date info on component availability, and if not, what actually is suitable, including alternate pinouts if applicable, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - so AI is serving multiple roles for you, from the creative naming side to being almost like a technical consultant and sourcing assistant. 

Tell me more about how you currently use AI to understand circuit elements you're not familiar with. What does that interaction typically look like for you?

User: I feel like I am dyslexic with signal flow, as well as understanding some concepts that might seem basic. In particular, I am developing a synthesizer, and I have a harder time understanding things like when a summing amp is necessary and when it isn't. Or, another example might be discussing diode clipping and cascades...knowledge about what different diode configurations are known to produce is helpful so I know if I'm barking up a tree that's been barked up to much. As far as interactions go...I feel like I get some practical understanding out of the conversation, but my confidence is still kind of low. What if the info is wrong?

AI: That concern about accuracy really resonates - especially when you're working with circuits where getting it wrong could mean a lot of wasted time and materials. The confidence issue you mention seems particularly important when you're pushing into new territory like synthesizer development.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: A practical example is asking how to get PCB files to order PCBs without the usually necessary gerber file. I have, in the example, a jpg or pdf of a PCB layout, and a complete BOM; how do I proceed? I got stiffed by someone years ago and I'm trying to reverse engineer their work. I have my business name literally copyrighted on the image of the PCB layout...I just don't have the gerber. The instruction was to recreate the layout from scratch, which was ultimately what I had to do, and the resources for that were helpful too. I then kind of proceeded to learn how easy it was to use EasyEDA with AI. It took about a year, but now I'm making them with no problems thanks to that one conversation. It kind of set me off from converting my stripboards to proper PCBs for the final sale models.

AI: That's a really compelling example - it sounds like that one conversation ended up being a real turning point for your business, opening up a whole new capability with PCB design. And the fact that it took a year to fully implement shows how that initial AI guidance rippled out into genuine skill development.

When you're working with AI on these technical questions - like in that PCB situation or when you're trying to understand circuit concepts - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I always feel like I'm the one driving the conversation and the AI is being somewhat over-supportive at times; I'd prefer it if a better approach was recommended as an alternative. For example, in the case of the PCB design, I was also given the recommendation to hire a circuit designer. This could've also been a successful approach, and putting the ball in my court for that one was very helpful. I did weigh that option, but since I'd been screwed before by a hired circuit designer (which I hadn't told the AI), I chose the DIY approach.

AI: That's really insightful - you're looking for AI to be more of a thoughtful advisor that presents multiple paths rather than just being encouraging about whatever direction you're already heading. It sounds like you value having those alternatives laid out so you can make informed decisions based on your full context, including past experiences the AI might not know about.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Yeah, it's almost like, there's a balance between the tailored approach and the ""generally best"" approach; I'd like them both laid out.

To answer your question, probably research streamlining. I would like to say BoM compilations, but I just don't need to do that with Excel until I find a model that can combine multiple BoMs into one without error, including up-to-date components with equivalents when necessary.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having both the customized advice for your specific situation and the broader ""best practice"" approach gives you the full picture to work with.

The research streamlining sounds like it's been a significant time-saver for you. And it's interesting that you're holding back on the BoM work until the accuracy and reliability gets to where you need it to be - that seems to tie back to your earlier concern about confidence in the information.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: None. AI can't repair broken electronics or handmake these boutique pedal, at least not yet hehe. If anything, my concerns are that the AI assistant I'm looking for is too far away.

AI: Ha! That's a great perspective - the hands-on craftsmanship and repair work you do really does seem pretty AI-proof for now.

Tell me more about that AI assistant you're looking for being ""too far away."" What would that ideal assistant look like for your work?

User: I feel like I already laid all that out; I'm happy to do so if you can't cycle through all that, but it's  basically a circuit wizard...we're talking population and design, demonstration with component swapability, essentially AI software for circuit design, and then a BoM compiler of course, with all that stuff I said. Again, I'm happy to say it again, but I feel like I did make all that pretty clear. I understand it's a lot.

AI: You're absolutely right - you laid that out very clearly earlier. I was curious if there were additional aspects beyond what you'd already described so well: the wizard librarian for component sourcing and pricing, the circuit theory guidance, BoM compilation with error-free component equivalents, and that broader circuit design software capability.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Hopefully I can rely on it more; I'd like to upload an image of an old stripboard build with components labeled in the picture and create a BoM for me. Then I can input other projects I'm adding to it, and the results are true...I won't go to build them all like I have in the past and realize the AI messed up and I'm short a dozen resistors or something. Being more reliable and proven as such, so then I can actually invest in it as a paid assistant if necessary, because it would certainly be cheaper than a human one. But it needs to have some initiative as well. And it needs to be intuitive and accurate.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting AI to present both tailored and ""generally best"" approaches, and your vision for that circuit wizard assistant that could handle everything from component identification to reliable BoM generation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. The way you've described both the current limitations you're working around and your clear vision for what would actually be useful in your field gives us a lot to think about.

Best of luck with your pedal business and that synthesizer development - it sounds like you're doing some really impressive work!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, thank you, you can proceed.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's start with the basics then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer, novels and also ghost writing blog articles. A typical project for ghost writing is to get a topic, double check the requirements for both the client and if there's any middle management, do the research, and write the article, typically between 500-2000 words, depending. Research usually takes a few hours, and writing usually takes an additional hour. Novels are significantly more involved, as you can imagine. Each novel is different, but a simplified version of a project overview would be to outline, research, create a first draft, edit, research, rewrite, create a second draft, and repeat until something is ready to be handed over to betas. Those are typically on my own timetable, for however long it takes.

AI: That's really helpful context - I can see how those two types of writing would have very different rhythms and requirements. The ghost writing sounds quite structured with those clear deliverables, while the novel work has that more iterative, open-ended timeline.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Research is the only area I use it heavily, but I will use AI sporadically for another area. For research, AI saves on time significantly by collecting a bunch of sources for me, or helping me hammer out details I either don't understand or have misunderstood. For the other area, I have a writing disability (ironic, I know), and AI helps me when I'm struggling. For example, when I'm struggling with spelling, I'm able to give AI the definition, and it can tell me the word I'm trying to use. Or when I'm trying to find the correct word for something, for example a piece of architecture or an uncommon piece of furniture, when I know what the thing is, but I'm having difficulty communicating it properly. AI is excellent for taking the description and finding the correct words for me.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI is serving two very distinct functions for you. The research efficiency piece makes a lot of sense, and I hadn't thought about how AI could function as that kind of language accessibility tool for writers with disabilities.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Currently, I'm working on a novel that takes place in a fantasy world, but set in a time similar to our Roman era in western civilization. So, research has been key on that, making sure it is as authentic as possible. AI in particularly is helpful in that kind of area because not only can it give me sources that are usually fact checked and reliable, but it is also aware of how I'm applying that research (ie, into a fantasy world), and can make note when something might not be very applicable, or when something might be uniquely relevant to my fictional world. As far as how it feels, it feels less stressful to have that kind of research buddy, and its encouragement always helps me not feel discouraged when the research itself isn't turning over what I might have hoped.

AI: That's really interesting - you're describing AI almost as a collaborative research partner that understands the context of your project, not just a search tool. The fact that it can flag what might or might not work for your specific fantasy setting sounds quite sophisticated.

When you're working with AI in that research capacity, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am definitely driving the creative decisions. The truth is that the writing community is under fire because of AI. There is a 'witch hunt', as it were, on writers using AI. I always make sure I am the creative driver and do all the writing, provable with receipts, because of it. So, I would say the collaboration is forced to be under very strict rules, and there's not much opportunity to explore what it could be because of the atmosphere among publishing and writing today.

AI: That's a really important point you're raising about the current atmosphere in the writing community. It sounds like there's a tension between what might be possible with AI collaboration and what feels safe or acceptable professionally.

Tell me more about that - how has this atmosphere affected your willingness to experiment with AI or explore different ways it might fit into your process?

User: It has affected it greatly. There have many times when I would have liked to tell the AI my entire ideas, just to get encouraging feedback and a hype man, but by and large, if any writer is caught collaborating actual ideas with AI, they are ostracized. Being an indie author is hard enough, and I've known indie writers whose sales have tanked just because they were (wrongly) accused of using AI. Not many readers will double check and just believe the accusations. And most publishing companies now will ban you if you use AI to so much as help you create an outline. So yeah, it has made me greatly hesitant to experiment with AI professional or explore different ways it could help. But it also makes me want to help find a solution.

AI: That paints a really stark picture of the professional risks involved. It sounds like you're navigating between seeing potential value in AI collaboration and the very real consequences of being associated with it in the writing community.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI, even within those constraints you've described?

User: I feel like my writing has becoming more sophisticated, again using AI to help with my disability, and I feel like my stories are more rounded with the aid in research. AI is able to give me significantly more sources than by myself, which helps me improve the worlds I create, and also helps me correct myself when something in my writing is wrong. As far as ghost writing is concerned, by ability to deliver articles is significantly faster, which means I can take on more work occasionally.

AI: That's a compelling picture - it sounds like within the boundaries you're working in, AI has actually enhanced both the quality and efficiency of your work. The research depth for worldbuilding and the accessibility support seem to have had real impacts.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field, beyond the professional risks you've already mentioned?

User: Beyond the professional risks, I do have concerned about AI replacing writers, and the qualities of stories being diminished without that human aspect. However, that, I feel like, is the usual concerns, when something so significant is new and becoming wide spread, and something only time will tell. Otherwise, I have concerns about how writing itself will become affected. For example, I have seen so many people fall victims to this 'witch hunt', even just socially when attempting to makes blog posts, because some people believe the presence of an em dash must mean it was created by AI. They forget, or not realize, that AI has learned to write from humans, and already writers, like myself, have began altering our styles to be starkly different. This will have a consequences in the future linguistically.

AI: That's a really astute observation about the linguistic consequences - the idea that fear of being mistaken for AI is actually changing how humans write. That's quite a feedback loop.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think the current atmosphere will shift, or do you expect to continue working within these same constraints?

User: Something will shift, although I would say it will be more like something will break. The constraints and tensions as they stand now aren't going to be able to last, but what will come out of it will be a solution for everyone. I don't feel confident enough to predict how that will evolve, but I do suspect that AI will become a large part of all creative work, as it will for most all work.

AI: That's a thoughtful way to put it - ""something will break"" - suggesting the current tensions aren't sustainable long-term.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the current professional climate is constraining experimentation, and that observation about writers already changing their styles to avoid being mistaken for AI - that linguistic ripple effect is fascinating.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of. Thank you! It was a pleasure talking to you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI as both a practical tool and within the current professional constraints will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you've experienced and the very real challenges facing writers today. Take care!"
creativity_0097,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a web developer and software developer, web apps and android apps primarily. A typical project is setting up a business website or a website for one of the apps I'm developing, creating content for it from graphics to blog articles and writing copy that converts lookers into customers.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse set of creative challenges - from the technical development work to the visual design and persuasive writing. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I rely heavily on AI tools for content creation, a lot of working on the main pages in the site relies on copy that converts and AI helps me A/B test and find something that fits the feel of the site. I use it for programming and occasionally graphics but primarily marketing copy is where I lean heavily on AI.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become particularly central to your copywriting and marketing work. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I used AI most recently to come up with and then refine the landing page copy for a client who runs a tattoo studio. She wanted something that fits her style so I told AI about her and the specific project goals and the task of writing the main copy. I work through it from top to bottom and then go back through again to find weaknesses and identify ways it could be better. It makes me feel a bit more confident in the marketing copy before I hand it over to a client but there are also issues like sounding too cliche or not finding the right tone.

AI: That's a fascinating process - it sounds like you're using AI as both a creative partner and then a critic of its own work. Tell me more about that back-and-forth process you described - when you go through to find weaknesses and identify improvements, what does that look like?

User: Ok so I start typically with describing the client and goals and such and then ask for the very first line on the website and really refine it before going much further because it sorta sets the tempo. I then go on from there to each individual section whether its telling about features of a SaaS product or describing the tattoo studio or business and who they serve. basically I ask for copy that converts for each section. once I get  something I feel confident with I start a new conversation or choose a new model and send it through and ask for critical feedback pros and cons. I use that feedback as guidance for the replacement text, explaining why I like parts the model picked as not great or highlighting areas I don't like. I then ask for two or three versions depending on how I feel about it. The goal being to find issues before it gets to the client and sometimes I'll use multiple models to bounce ideas around and brainstorm ways to improve it

AI: That's a really sophisticated workflow - using different models and fresh conversations to get unbiased feedback, almost like assembling your own creative review team. 

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm driving the decisions but I get AI to identify weaknesses in the copy. I'm not particularly attached to it so anything can go and then ultimately I decide on which one is better. Sometimes I'll do an A/B test and show both to the client and we sorta pick out what is best or send both out and display copy A to one visitor and copy B to another visitor and see which one gets more clients through the door. It helps me do more work in a short amount of time and offer a higher level of service

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've found a way to maintain creative control while leveraging AI's analytical capabilities to scale up your output and quality. The A/B testing approach is particularly clever.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I've always struggled with writing copy, I've studied it extensively and understand what does and doesn't work but actually getting the words onto a page has always been a challenge for me. The thing that changed the most is being able to feel confident that what I have is going to work and spending the time on refining it instead of coming up with one thing I can try five different things until I get two that I like so much I can't decide between. It makes it so I'm delivering something closer to the high end marketing firms as an individual working from home.

AI: That's such a compelling insight - it sounds like AI has helped you bridge the gap between knowing what good copy looks like and actually producing it. You mentioned being able to compete with high-end marketing firms now as an individual.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm highly optimistic. I think the programming side of things and AI are more concerning than marketing and as a solo founder I'm not as worried about being put out of work as some people might be. For me, AI is empowering but I'm not just collecting a paycheck everything I do is either worth something or worth nothing and I won't know until later on if it works or not. If I worked for a company that found clients and I was writing the copy for them on a large team I might worry about job security but for my situation, I find it helpful. I think using it without asking for refinements creates a word salad that sounds very similar to everything out there. I'll occasionally send a landing page back through and the feedback is something along the lines of ""this is very generic"" or what have you. Overall I don't think AI will harm my marketing efforts and it will only get better and make me more productive.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - you're seeing AI as a productivity multiplier rather than a replacement, especially in your role as a solo founder where the results speak for themselves.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think the next step is to have something like an IDE but for marketing. I'd really love to be able to tell one thing all of the goals and everything about the product or business and work on creative assets without telling it the same thing over and over. The context limits are something I bump into quite often and arbitrary limits put in place by AI companies to limit usage is really annoying. I think in the next few years it will be common to just have a cloud computer with a dedicated AI environment instead of paying for individual subscriptions for image generation, video generation etc just one main control panel that creates marketing and creative assets to reach the same goals and with the same quality without struggle. Image and video generation especially is hard to get reliable assets from though its improving.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you bridge that gap between understanding what good copy should look like and actually being able to produce it confidently - that seems like such a fundamental creative challenge that AI is helping solve.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think thats it, I'm more optimistic than some people and really reliant on coming up with something good for my clients I can deliver a higher quality product thanks to AI and it has genuine results but at the same time sometimes I'll have to refine and refine or a model will be great one day and not as great the next week or for a different project so I do use multiple models as a result which I find to be really important in getting a better idea of what is possible and finding things to consider in the future.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using multiple models strategically, the importance of that iterative refinement process, and how AI has empowered you as a solo founder to compete at a higher level - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the practical challenges, like context limits and model inconsistency. That kind of honest perspective is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are actually working in the real world.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your projects!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, no questions yet :)

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: It is my hobby, and something I spend a lot of time doing, which is researching and writing, about all sorts of topics. A typical project would be anything from a personal interest, or something in current affaris, a philosophy - generally any topic I'm curious about - becoming something I study, almost accademically and then write about. Its a cathartic way of helping me understand myself and the world around me more fully. My neurodiversity has held me back somewhat in the past, but now I'm overcoming those obstacles, I'm re-framing this personal journey as something I can re-orient into creating things to help others like me, get on in the world better. In a sense, give them some of the assistance I could have done with when I was younger.

AI: That's really meaningful work - using your own journey to help others navigate similar challenges. I can hear how personal and purposeful this writing is for you.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: In the past, due to my ASD, I focused in on a range of topics of interest, researched them, and wrote about them, or produced some guide or flow chart - like a process of helping me understand the world and myself. This was really messy, un-focused, the topics were random and often I didn't finish them. I improved my work flow as an adult, higher education and work experience gave me skills that improved this hobby. It wasn't until AI came along though that I've seen a noticable difference in my output. I can use a range of AI tools now to help me research that save me so much time. Brainstorming ideas, checking for bias, validating information, cross checking data, finding the right words or ways to phrase a concept, untangling metaphore, exploratory thinking, advice... so much more, I could write a lot about how AI fits into my creative process. But to put it simply, it helps me untangle and present all the things I'm curious about in the world, that I think may be of interest or use to others, turning a mess of ideas into something useable.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become a powerful tool for helping you organize and refine your natural curiosity and insights. You mentioned it's made a noticeable difference in your output.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, as part of my own journey, I'm making moves to improve my health and weight loss is one of the goals. Naturally I need to understand more about health, nutrition, exercise etc to help me lose weight, I can't just pick a diet and follow a schedule, I need to understand whats going on with me physiologiclaly - how ever complex or detailed that is. I never found anyone with the patients to listen to all my questions and go over and over details until they make sense to me, so in terms of how it felt for me - its like having the guide or teacher in my life now that I always needed. This project helped me understand so much more about how my body works. I've been able to probe and query so many things that it would have taken me hours - weeks maybe to research on my own. I feel gratitude, and I'm feeling a sense of acomplishment for what its done for me with this project so far, I'm still in the middle of this one though, so I'm hoping those feelings are magnified again by the end of it.

AI: That's really powerful - having that patient guide who can go over details until they make sense sounds transformative, especially when you haven't found that kind of support elsewhere. The gratitude you describe comes through clearly.

When you're working with AI on a project like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: The collaboration is quite a nuanced subject here, I am in the drivers seat for most of it, but as I use the AI for bias checking, ensuring I'm not missing any vital pieces of information or context etc, I'd describe it as a corrective co-pilot. As far as research and learning goes anyway. When it comes to writing, I do most of the writing, but I'll often look for ways of explaining something I cant articulate, or the best word for something, and I'll often dump all I've written into the chat and get it to check it over, to make sure I've not repeated myself, over-explained or contradicted myself somehow - so I don't see it as my work alone, I'm very aware of the level of input from AI that contributes towards the finished product. I would say though, that I am in control of the decisions over-all, but the smaller details - which make up the whole - are very much suggested or created by AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to describe it - you as the driver with AI as a ""corrective co-pilot."" It sounds like you have a clear sense of where your agency lies versus where AI contributes, even while acknowledging how those smaller AI-contributed details add up to something significant in the whole.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I can refer back to an answer I gave earlier and say; everything has changed about my creative work. I feel AI is enabling me to get past so many of the obstacles I previously faced. To answer specifically though, the 'most' change is probably my confidence with the work I do. I have dumped a lot of my work in the bin in the past, being overly critical of my own skills and acomplishments. Now (with the help of AI) I see those mistakes, that low quality work, as just early stepping stones I was on, before AI started clearing everything up so well.

AI: That shift in confidence is really striking - moving from being overly critical and throwing work away to seeing those earlier efforts as stepping stones. It sounds like AI has helped you reframe not just your current work, but your whole creative journey.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My concerns with AI in this field, as with any field, would be regarding job losses, I wouldn't be particuarly effected as its not a job for me, but if journalists, researchers, non-fiction writers generally are replaced by AI, something has to be done about supporting people who are losing their jobs to AI. I'm not that concerned that AI will 'replace' this field any time soon, but we do certainly have the oportunity and potential for AI to start compiling and creating the best, most accurate information on any subject, like a perfect wikipedia for everything, and in that situation, millions of jobs would no longer be needed.

AI: That's a really important perspective - you're seeing both the personal benefits while being mindful of the broader economic implications for professionals in these fields. The idea of AI potentially creating that ""perfect wikipedia for everything"" is quite a vision.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: The models are constantly improving their understanding and communication, I think we'll see more personalised AI, that gets to know the users better and is more adaptive to their needs. I think that will lead to even better optimisation between people and AI. AI will become more and more integrated into these roles, making the processes smoother and quickly. I think in 5 years time I'll be able to tell the AI what I want to look up, and it will know me well enough that its response will be somewhere near the end product, that I currently take hours or days, sometimes weeks to pull together. Generally speaking I think we'll shorten the gap in time between a projects initial conception, and the end product I create from that idea.

AI: That vision of AI knowing you well enough to jump much closer to your end product is fascinating - essentially compressing what now takes weeks into something much more immediate.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has become that patient guide and teacher you always needed, and how it's helped you reframe your entire creative journey - from being overly critical to seeing your work as stepping stones.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think I managed to mention all the main points I wanted to, thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI has transformed not just your workflow but your confidence and relationship with your own creative work - especially as someone navigating neurodiversity - have been incredibly valuable. The way you described AI as that patient guide you always needed really stuck with me, and your thoughtful perspective on both the personal benefits and broader societal implications gives us a lot to think about.

Your responses will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Thanks again for being so generous with your time and insights today!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds fine to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Well, I work in a couple of areas. One is graphic design where I need to create personalised prints and designs, the other is written. The written work is normally a presentation that needs to fit a particular theme or piece of writing. usually religious in nature. It may sometimes be an application for a grant or fund. Research is very important in order to ensure that the written work has integrity. The writing needs to be informative, engaging and connect with people in a way that hopefully leaves them feeling changed in some way.

AI: That's really interesting - you're working across both visual and written mediums with some pretty meaningful objectives around connecting with people and creating impact. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I still feel that AI is lacking a bit for the visual process, it appears to struggle when it comes to using fonts and writing. It's really helpful for the writing process. I can use it to give me inspiration. For example providing an idea, theme or piece of writing to the model, it often then provides some insights or thoughts. It's particularly helpful to bounce ideas off, check if certain thoughts or insights are factually accurate, or to help build on ideas. Sometimes, if I have a bit of a block and I don't know where to go next, I can upload what I have and ask for some ideas for what is is missing from the written piece.

AI: Tell me more about that process of bouncing ideas off AI - what does that typically look like when you're in the middle of working on a piece?

User: It may be asking about historical context for a piece of writing (particularly religious writing). Often this may lead to asking further questions about specific people, cultures, religions or practices. This all feeds into gaining a deeper understanding of the piece of writing that is being studied. An example of this may be starting with ""give me the historical context of 'passage x'"". The response from the model may lead me on to the follow up question ""Tell me more about y"". Alternatively I may ask the model to rephrase a certain part of my writing to make it clearer, or ask if what I have included in my writing is factually accurate.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic back-and-forth process, especially with the research element. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: A recent project began with my question ""why did Paul feel the need to write these words to the church in Thessaloniki 'make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, 12 so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.'""  This question began the process for me to understand more of what the passage was trying to say, rather than what may at first appear obvious to a modern day western reader. It helped me to get inside the mind of the author of the text. The information provided helped me to begin to find areas of interest and relevance that I could then hang a presentation on, ensuring that I was not misrepresenting the intended message. It was incredibly helpful. Not only did it help give me a starting point, but it also meant that I had a good amount of evidence and information to support my angle.

AI: That's a fascinating example - it sounds like AI helped you move beyond surface-level interpretation to really understand the deeper context and intent. When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am driving the creative decisions. The AI is a great asset to achieving what I want to achieve.

AI: What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: My research has sped up massively. Rather than scrawling through web searches and looking through books, I can ask more direct questions for the specific answers I want. This helps to engage my creativity quicker as well, as I have more time for the creative process and a partner to bounce ideas off.

AI: That's a significant efficiency gain. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: The concerns would be that it becomes so good that there is a temptation to bypass the human element altogether. Whether that is through busyness in other areas, laziness, or that it appears to do a better job without the human input.

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about maintaining that human element. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it may develop into a place where it could become a recorder of thoughts and notes (a bit like a dictaphone), from there it provides suggestions for how to order the thoughts and make sense of them. I think it will also get better at writing specifically in the tone and voice of a particular user (i.e. me). It may be able to produce helpful slides to accompany a talk or presentation, and hopefully improve with fonts and text.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has transformed your research process - moving from ""scrawling through web searches"" to having that direct, conversational partner for exploring deeper contexts, especially in your religious writing work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing springs to mind

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research partner and collaborator - particularly how it helps you get to the deeper meaning behind texts rather than just surface interpretations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you're seeing and your concerns about maintaining that essential human element in the creative process. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great. Let us begin.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do acting and comedy and I am involved in a lot of behind the scenes/backstage work as well in both film and theater. A typical project is a gig for me frankly. I am being brought into a team to perform a particular role because of my distinct abilities.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you work across multiple facets of the entertainment industry. I can imagine each gig brings its own unique challenges and creative demands.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I primarily engage AI tools to help me deal with administrative tasks and paperwork, filling forms when I am applying for jobs, keeping on top of my paperwork for my union membership, tailoring my resume and portfolio, managing my calendar and schedule.

AI: That's a really practical application - using AI to handle the business side so you can focus on the creative work itself. It sounds like AI is helping you manage the less glamorous but essential parts of being a working creative professional.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I recently helped to design a set for a comedy video/podcast. I had done some drawings as mock ups to show the client what it would look like, but they were unsatisfied with the work I had done. So I transferred my drawing into a AI and was able to make it into a realistic, 3d image and was able to convince the client and make some important changes. We used that image to run green-screen screen tests and give the client a chance to play in the space and see how it would look on camera before we committed to building the set.  I was frustrated at first with how the AI tool handled rendering my drawing however, the experience helped me to learn how to better prompt the model to get desired results.

AI: That's a fascinating example - it sounds like AI became a crucial communication tool between you and the client, helping bridge the gap between your creative vision and what they could visualize. 

Tell me more about that frustration you mentioned with how the AI initially handled your drawing. What was happening there, and how did you figure out how to get better results from it?

User: It is a rather specific thing, but when you mention to a model to NOT include some element, it would invariably show up. It's like dealing with humans and you tell them to not think of a pink elephant. Do you get my drift? Elements that I didn't want included, I did not even mention. Because for example I would tell it, ""get rid of the bust of Shakespeare""; The bust would appear in every iteration even after explicit requests to remove it.

AI: That's such a vivid way to put it - the ""pink elephant"" problem! It really captures how AI seems to latch onto the very things you're trying to avoid when you mention them explicitly. 

So you learned to work around that by simply not mentioning unwanted elements at all. How did that change feel for you as a creative professional - having to adapt your communication style to work effectively with the AI tool?

User: It was kind of annoying but it is like learning to deal with any other personality. I will admit that I caution a lot of people to be careful and sparing in using AI tools because of this, often they will not get what they want at first because they have not bothered to learn how to prompt engineer and will either become frustrated or end up producing work that is ""good enough"" but contains other flaws or errors that they had not been paying attention to at all.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the learning curve and the potential pitfalls. It sounds like you see AI as a tool that requires skill and attention to use well, rather than something that just automatically produces good results.

When you caution people about using AI tools, what kinds of flaws or errors do you typically see them miss when they settle for ""good enough"" work?

User: ""short attention span errors"" for example, you generate an image of a waiting room with potted plants. the issue is that they are not real plants and only bear passing resemblance to real potted plants but you'd only notice if you're looking for more than a split second. A lot of people in Comedy generate posters for shows using AI tools to avoid dealing with graphics software like Photoshop or Gimp, but also create posters where the comedian doesn't look anything like their avatar, they have a double headed mic or extra fingers. It look good enough to the user because they had some ideas about what they wanted to see but neglect details that the end user (the people they are trying to convince to come to their show) will see and judge them on. I am sure you know there is a virulent anti AI sentiment in a lot of the creative world.

AI: That's really telling - those ""short attention span errors"" you describe paint a clear picture of how AI output can look convincing at first glance but fall apart under closer inspection. And I can see how that connects to the broader tension you mention about anti-AI sentiment in creative fields.

When you're working with AI tools yourself, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in your process?

User: I use AI primarily to do the ""boring stuff"" or use it as a ""sounding board"". I very rarely ever use AI to generate unique ideas or concepts. Rather I prefer to use it to tell my ideas to and to try to identify gaps or inconsistencies in my own work, as a third person perspective to look at my own output from a different angle.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as more of a critical thinking partner rather than an idea generator. It sounds like you've found a way to maintain your creative agency while leveraging AI's ability to offer that outside perspective.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: The amount of people who do not know anything about AI except that it is the new hot thing and they want to use it to make their projects stand out. This is not a wrong or bad instinct per se but it has made me think about what the true best use case for AI in creative fields is. Because for science and mathematics, it is straightforward: sometimes there are problems so complex that this amount of computing power and linguistic sophistication is the solution to overcoming human limitations. For arts it is the opposite: how do we use this tool to maximize human potential rather than suppressing it

AI: That's a profound distinction you're making - using AI to overcome human limitations in technical fields versus maximizing human potential in creative fields. That seems to get at the heart of a lot of the tension around AI in creative work.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am afraid it will be used by unscrupulous parties (especially executives) to cut corners, cheat workers and de-value traditional film-making techniques and skills.  Movies and the theater and music are businesses after all, and maximizing profits is still the name of the game.

AI: That's a very grounded concern - the economic pressures in entertainment are real, and AI could easily become a tool for cost-cutting rather than creative enhancement. It sounds like you're seeing this tension between AI as a creative collaborator versus AI as a way to replace skilled workers.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think that AI generated mass entertainment will proliferate, somewhat like the cheap pulp novels and paperbacks from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A segment of the population will enjoy these and another will see it as an undesirable symptom of modernity. There will be at least one film or album with an ""AI"" actor or musician that will provoke very heated debate about the nature of art. I also think that there will be both a renaissance of traditional film making (painted scenery and sets , practical effects, etc) as well as a boom of independent creators using AI tools to bring their worlds to life who otherwise would have never had the opportunity. I think there will be strict regulations placed upon AI use in creative fields because of the strength of the Hollywood/Broadway/entertainment lobby.

AI: That's such a nuanced vision - you're seeing multiple parallel tracks emerging rather than just one direction. The comparison to pulp novels is really apt - suggesting AI entertainment might find its own market niche while traditional craftsmanship potentially gains renewed appreciation.

Before we wrap up, those are all the questions I had prepared, and you've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to maximize rather than suppress human potential, and your practical wisdom about the importance of really learning how to work with these tools effectively.

Is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that about does it. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of working with AI tools - from the ""pink elephant"" prompting challenges to your thoughtful approach of using AI as a creative sounding board rather than an idea generator - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated hearing your perspective on how to navigate AI as a tool that requires skill and attention, and your vision for how the creative landscape might evolve with both AI-generated content and a renaissance of traditional techniques coexisting. 

Thanks again, and best of luck with your upcoming projects!"
creativity_0101,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, I have no questions!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a full time wedding photographer so I use many tools to help me in the various stages of my projects. With my clients, I typically help plan some of their wedding details and do correspondance, which I use AI to help with. Creatively, I get to use AI in a lot of my marketing - like creating content for social media or blogs for my website - and in the post-production process of selecting, editing, and delivering the client's wedding photos.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI touches multiple stages of your workflow, from client communication all the way through to final delivery. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: My job is naturally quite creative since not only it deals with the art of photography, but as an entrepreneur I feel my approach to ""doing business"" is creative. I find I use AI most when I am brainstorming, iterating ideas, trying to communicate to associates and clients, create effective and passive workflows, and especially with marketing. I like to have conversations frequently where I state my objective or intended outcome and then have the AI ask me questions, gain deep knowledge understanding about my approach or perspective, and then help me create the path to obtain my objective. For example, when using AI for creating Instagram content, I will first extensively train the AI on my tone of voice, brand values, mission, objectives, workflows, and more. I typically will say something like ""I need you to help me create my Instagram content for my wedding photography business. I'm trying to reach (this type of person) and get them to (do this thing like book a wedding package). Here's what I want my content to look like or sound like. Here are some difficulties I face."" And then before I let it help me, I tell it to ask me questions to gain better understanding from me of what it may need to accomplish the task. I will do this with other things - such as creating a new client experience or package. Sometimes I will do a similar approach to help me practice sales calls or create a new script.  Really the possibilities here are endless.

I also will use it to edit copy on my website, or to review the copy I have and tell me if it's in a good order for the ""customer journey"" and ask if there's something I can change to have more impact. I like to think of all AI use as a collaboration. I provide the intended outcome and have the AI help me better define that outcome and the supporting details. Then I provide the initial idea or the draft version and then use the AI to help me see my ""blind spots"". I iterate my thoughts about the blind spots it pointed out and then it helps me come up with solutions. I will spend extensive amounts of time on many tasks using AI and think it has improved my quality of output in every way and arena of business. 

I also use tools that are AI powered, but not the typical ""chat bot"" AI. I use programs that will AI select a desired amount of images from 10k images from a wedding for example based on certain qualities I'm looking for. It will select the best of the images, include one of every grouping from family photos, omit everything that has closed eye, or follow the other instructions  given. I use a program that will auto edit all of my images to a certain style that is trained based on my past images. I have a program that delivers the images AI sorted by individual in the images. The longer I think about it the more uses I realize I use AI for.

AI: That's incredibly detailed - thank you for painting such a clear picture of how deeply integrated AI has become across your entire business. I can really hear the collaborative approach you've developed.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I am in the process of extending my business to include ""Lifestyle Photography"" which is like family photos. Instead of just integrating it into the current business I have I decided it needs to be it's own standalone thing - really so that my wedding business doesn't become in-cohesive and watered down. In the earliest stages I think AI helped me come to this conclusion when I was confused about how to fuse the two together. But this overhaul that I'm still currently in has required that I look through every corner of my business and convert my business assets (like pdf guides, onboarding documents, contracts, website copy, portfolio blogs, sales scripts) into a version that communicates my lifestyle photography objectives and services. Some of that has been more administrative and editorial in nature, but overall I ""outsource"" a lot of the decision brainstorming and idea creation to AI because it's an overwhelming and idea-heavy process. Since I train my AI chats with things like my mission statement or values or desired outcome, when I present an idea or problem I find that it will consider the impact to that ""bigger vision"" more easily and consistently than I do. When it knows in such detail my entire business or even just my client experience, I find that when I do even really quick chats like ""how should I respond to this email"" it gives a very well considered and thorough answer. But this use of AI for the ""creation"" stages of things provides me so much more freedom to pursue the best ideas well and abandon the not so great ones early.

AI: That's a really compelling example - it sounds like AI has become almost like a strategic business partner that helps you maintain consistency with your bigger vision while navigating complex decisions.

When you're working with AI in these situations, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I think I like to think of myself as the decider or CEO in this example, and think of that AI as the ""collector"" or researcher or well of information. As mentioned, I typically begin with my objective. Even a simple weekly task of writing up all my Instagram captions for the week, I will know what I want them to push towards or ""sell"" and so my collaboration with the AI is asking it to provide me a wealth of ideas of topics that I can then pare down and dive deeper every step with. Once I narrow down to one topic for a caption, for example, then the new objective is to write that caption, and first I need a hook...so I go to the AI and ask for a wealth of ideas of hooks that would capture the reader. This process just continues until I feel like I like where we've landed. I frequently find myself saying things like ""no I don't like any of these ideas. Let's try something that (is more educational, or more emotionally driven for example)..."" and then steer the direction a bit to get ideas closer to what my original vision was. I find it is one of the most valuable things to help me ideate, test, and come to decisions quickly, but keeping myself in creative control is essential with my work.

AI: That's such a clear dynamic - you as the CEO setting direction and the AI as this expansive research partner helping you explore possibilities within your vision. It really sounds like you've found a way to maintain your creative authority while leveraging AI's ability to generate options.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Definitely the amount of time I spend on these tasks has been reduced. Sometimes I feel that it is reduced, but then the AI provides me with such great and clear ideas that I am able to execute them significantly better. The quality of my ideas has gone up, my decisions are more decisive because often I've been walked through many potential ""outcomes"" or ideas and so my confidence is higher, and I know for sure the output is improved. The use of the AI tools in my post process with culling and editing my images has cut my turnaround time on galleries from 12 weeks to about 3! And when I provide better marketing materials, a better client experience, faster service, etc. then I am able to charge more, so I know I've been making significantly more money. I do feel that one downside is the sheer amount of ideas I run through - it can give me a sense of shiny-object syndrome and if not kept in check it can run me a bit crazy and feeling like there's always something new to chase. I've had to become much more intentional about what I take on and how it will promote my long-term objectives.

AI: That's such an honest reflection - the dramatic improvements in turnaround time and quality, but also that challenge of managing the overwhelming flow of possibilities. It sounds like AI has almost amplified your creative potential but required you to develop new discipline around focus.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I worry that relying on it too much in regards to creative steps will remove me from the drivers seat. I avoided using AI for my photo editing for a very long time thinking that was too big of a ""part"" of what I do to outsource it, that the creative reflection of ""me"" would no longer be in my work. I personally found a workflow that leans on AI to do the bulk of the work early on, so that I am less crunched for time and have more freedom to revisit the gallery with my own eyes, intentionally making edits and tweaks that I may have missed before or not had time for. So in a sense, I am more removed from the ""busy work"" of editing like exposing or fixing skin tones, and I am more free to let the creative pieces be tended to intentionally - like crop or adding in depth of shadows, or removing distractions. I think there's hardly any downside on my end for using it in an administrative sense, to draft or template email responses, or to think of the workflows that are more thorough to fit the experience I want a client to have, but on the creative side I have to carefully watch how far removed I become from the heart of my work and to consider what impact that is having on my work.

AI: That's such a thoughtful distinction you've made - using AI to handle the technical busy work so you can focus more intentionally on the truly creative decisions. It sounds like you've found a way to let AI enhance rather than replace your creative voice.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see the photography industry embracing AI more as a ""whole."" I know in my circles I am one of the few that really embrace these tools and even just the use of AI bots in every day to alleviate the brain fog of general business ownership. I'm excited to see what special AI powered tools may be created. The ones I use now have objectively been the best thing to improve my output, time spent, earning power, etc. But I do worry that with mass acceptance there will be the risk that AI is used more - but not more intentionally. I do not want to fall into that trap. I also see there being a limit to the growth or adoption I can have of these tools because of my standard or guardrails protecting my creative ownership. As I scale my business I think it will help more with administrative stuff. I never ever see myself abandoning the tools I use now, so it can only go ""up"" from here, but I do wonder how much more. I do find new ways every day to use it, so I'm sure I will continue to explore and invest in these options. I think it will be embraced as photographers dabble in it and realize that if done right you really can still protect and keep your creative ownership and direction.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative ownership while leveraging AI as a strategic partner, and how you've developed such intentional guardrails to stay in the driver's seat.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between efficiency and creative control, and how you've developed such a thoughtful, intentional approach to AI collaboration, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both the tremendous benefits you've experienced - like cutting your turnaround time from 12 weeks to 3 - as well as the challenges of managing that ""shiny object syndrome"" and staying focused on your long-term vision. Your approach to using AI as a strategic research partner while maintaining yourself as the CEO making the creative decisions is a fascinating model.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your lifestyle photography expansion!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive in. 

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer and editor, so my flow varies a lot from project to project, but generally it goes like this:
-I go over the initial version of the project, be it notes I took on a show or movie or a rough draft someone else sends me, like a blog post or a manuscript. I take it in and make any obvious edits, like fixing typos or grammar mistakes, or rephrasing things that don't quite sound right.
-I typically like to wait a while before proceeding with the next step, which is thinking over the whole project and how the major ideas fit together. This often involves me rearranging whole paragraphs, cutting and moving chunks of text, more intricate rephrasing, and sometimes adding headers to break up lengthy web posts. If I'm drafting an original post, it usually looks like me organizing thoughts into distinct categories and then weaving them together so they sound like they flow together naturally. If there are a lot of notes and the thoughts are hard to keep track of, I may color-code them to make it easier. If I'm doing something like editing a manuscript, this is where I might make more overarching story or character notes in the margins as I read.
-The final step is to read the whole thing through again and polish it up, making sure that all my edits flow naturally and make sense, and, if it's not my work, that it still sounds like the original author. If I'm editing a manuscript, this is where I'll type out a letter highlighting what I think are the most crucial areas that need looking at. 
-If I'm editing or writing something for the web, the last step is to go through and do basic SEO edits.

AI: That's a really thorough breakdown of your process - I can see how much thought goes into each stage. The way you describe waiting between that initial review and the deeper structural work is particularly interesting.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Rarely, if ever, do I use AI in the creative process itself - I enjoy writing and I generating the basics takes the fun out of it for me. What I do use it for is to keep track of character and setting notes in original fiction and when reading complex manuscripts: My notes are often messy and disorganized, and when I was younger I often found myself wishing I could have some sort of Clippy-esque assistant that would just be able to read through my notes and answer any question I had directly. This is especially useful in works with a lot of characters or places to keep track of - doubly so for fictional ones with no other reference material for those things.

AI: That's fascinating - you've essentially found your ""Clippy-esque assistant"" for organization! I love how specific that use case is. It sounds like you're using AI as a kind of smart filing system for complex information rather than for the creative generation itself.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was writing a scene in a fantasy setting that contained dozens of potential character interactions - I'm co-writing a novel with another author in a sort of literary roleplay-type format, so there are a number of potential interactions that could happen at any given time. I was able to use an AI assistant to go through the names and place them in different areas of a large palace ballroom and social scene, and then to move them around naturally as the scene continued. There is no way I could have pulled off the true randomness of the interactions and character groupings without such a tool, and the resulting scenes would not have been nearly as interesting as what we produced.

AI: That's really compelling - using AI to manage the logistics of complex social dynamics so you could focus on the actual storytelling. It sounds like it enabled a level of scene complexity that would have been overwhelming to track manually.

When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I would say that it's maybe a 60-30-10 split - I wrote most of the background material, but my creative partner is in full control of the lead character, and therefore of wherever the scene goes. The AI's creative input is in choosing who is in what room at which time (aside from a few key characters who need to be in certain places at certain times for story reasons.) 

It does also have a sort of tangential, accidental input, in that sometimes unless I refresh it by pasting the character list in again, the AI will begin to hallucinate characters who don't exist. Some of these characters and names, however, have been interesting enough that I did build them out and add them to the roster for later. None have been used yet, but there's at least one that I'm planning to use in the future.

AI: That's such an interesting dynamic - the AI essentially acting as a logistics coordinator, but then its ""mistakes"" becoming creative sparks. I love that you've embraced those hallucinated characters as potential story elements rather than just seeing them as errors.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI this way?

User: I find it much easier to get over my procrastination instincts and start the scene, actually - I have ADHD and I'm awful at logistics, on my worst days it makes my head actually hurt a little bit. Having an easy workaround for that is really helpful, especially on days when I can't take my medication.

It also, as I mentioned before, has made for much more interesting character pairings than I would have thought to make on my own - I like that it forces me to consider less-than-obvious dynamics, like how the King might converse with his son's friends in a casual, convival setting.

AI: That's really insightful - the way AI helps with both the executive function challenges and pushes you toward unexpected creative choices. The ADHD perspective is particularly valuable here - it sounds like AI is removing a barrier that was sometimes preventing you from getting to the creative work you actually enjoy.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm worried about the kids, honestly. I know how tempting it can be to use something like this as a crutch for the hard or boring stuff - if I had had the option of being able to put my thesis statement for an essay or something into an AI, and getting an already-finished outline back, I would have taken it every single time. But I would have been losing really valuable time exercising that mental muscle when I was young and still had the neuroplasticity for it to Really Take, and I have no doubt that I wouldn't be nearly as good a writer as I am today. And I probably would have wanted to roll my eyes at anyone trying to give me this warning, too. 

I'm also concerned at the sheer amount of what I'm going to call ""AI Slop"" (quickly, shoddily-made fiction generated entirely by an AI that was given no instructions about theme, message, or any other relevant content other than plot details, and therefore delivers very little human value relative to the time and effort it takes to read it) that seems to be widely available to read now. I know this makes me sound like a snob, but I truly feel like I never used to have to shuffle through so much empty-feeling fiction before I got to something good before. I see a lot of listings for it as an editor, and it's disheartening, because I really can tell the difference, and it loses something I can't put my finger on. It's like the uncanny valley for writing.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns. The neuroplasticity point about developing those mental muscles early is particularly striking - that there might be critical periods for learning to think through complex problems that could be bypassed too easily.

And your ""uncanny valley for writing"" observation is fascinating. You mentioned you can tell the difference - what do you think it is that you're sensing is missing in that AI-generated content, even if you can't quite put your finger on it?

User: I have almost no idea. I was like this with grammar when I was a kid, too - I could tell you immediately when something was wrong, but I usually had to look up the rule in order to be able to explain why. It was like it just hit my ear wrong or something. (It's why I became an editor.) It's the same thing with AI - I don't know if it's word choice or cadence or what, but I often just get that feeling, like something's just Off. A little too formulaic, maybe? Or too polished? Reads too much like textbook examples and the Better Answer Formula from like sixth grade? It varies, so it's hard to put a finger on exactly what it is, but those are my best guesses.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - that intuitive ear you have for language picking up on something subtly ""off"" about the rhythm or authenticity, even when the technical execution might be correct. It sounds like your experience as an editor has given you a really fine-tuned sense for authentic voice versus something more manufactured.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Well, first of all, I would definitely use it more if I could be assured the models I was using weren't guzzling gallons and gallons of water every time I ask a question. I do feel the guilt behind that weighing on me, which is one of the non-mental-exercise reasons I try to use it sparingly. 

That said, if and when that becomes a non-factor, I can see myself naming various assistant bots for different projects I work on - like Jarvis or Friday from the Iron Man movies, but specifically for individual universes I am working on or with. It'd be really cool if I could develop a kind of template for that, and then use it to help other writers, like a service or something.

I can also see myself using it for brainstorming and character dialogue-type stuff: I'm great at writing dialogue but not always great at coming up with the pretext to cover the subtext of important conversations. I feel like feeding character profiles into the right AI and asking it to just generate conversations and situations between them could spark some ideas for those types of things. 

I also see myself continuing to use it in another capacity I have not mentioned because it is not strictly creative: administrative tasks. Specifically: Emails, form letters, invoices, reminders, etc. I'm terrible at sounding professional in the traditional sense - I write exactly the way I talk, which is like a [REDACTED] who grew up on sitcoms and fan forums. I put what I want to say in normal person language, and the AI gives me back the professional email with all of the right terms (that I could not have remembered to use if you paid me) in all the right places. Expanding on that area of assistance - though I can't exactly imagine how - would be amazing for me.

AI: Those are really compelling future applications - the idea of project-specific AI assistants for different fictional universes is particularly creative. And it's interesting how you're thinking about potentially turning that into a service for other writers.

You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with the logistics that can be barriers to creativity, while also your concerns about preserving those crucial developmental opportunities for young writers.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That covers everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing such detailed and thoughtful insights about your creative process and how AI fits into it. Your perspective on using AI as a logistics coordinator rather than a creative generator, your concerns about skill development in young writers, and that fascinating observation about the ""uncanny valley for writing"" have all been incredibly valuable.

I found your approach particularly interesting - how you've found ways to preserve what you love about the creative process while using AI to remove barriers like complex organizational tasks that can trigger procrastination. And your vision for project-specific AI assistants is really innovative.

I work with with contractor managing the job to create mock-ups to present to the client with design inspiration and remodeling options. Some of examples of exterior remodeling could be changing paint colors, railings, or landscaping while interior could be updating design concepts or reworking internal room dimensions.

AI: That sounds like really engaging work - helping people visualize their space transformations before they commit to the changes. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Currently AI only fits well into the preliminary stages of my work. I use AI to brainstorm ideas for different design choices using images, creating images of what theoretical rooms could look like and creating mood boards with different ideas to give clients a lot of variety.

AI: Tell me more about that brainstorming phase. What does that process actually look like when you're using AI for those images and mood boards?

User: For example, my most recent use was creating options for exterior railings. I was given multiple pictures of the exterior of a home and my job was to create a portfolio of images of different railings on each angle of the house to give the client a book of options to choose from. AI models in the design space are still somewhat limited. They couldn't complete the job of pasting railings onto a house without altering the original picture significantly, but I did use them to give me examples of railings on coastal houses with similar themes. I took those AI inspiration railings and found realistic images that I was able to photoshop onto my original pictures for client mock-ups.

AI: That's a really interesting hybrid approach - using AI for inspiration rather than final execution. Can you describe a bit more about what happens when AI alters the original pictures too much? What kinds of changes does it make that don't work for your purposes?

User: I've tried multiple different AI models and each have similar limitations. For my purposes, clients want to see what these different design choices look like on their exact house. When AI models are generating, they often struggle with instructions to only change specific artifacts in an image and instead change the entire image. For example, when I use the prompt ""change the exterior railings from aluminum to wrought iron, use a design popular on high-end coastal vacation homes, do not change any other aspect of the image, the rest of the house should stay exactly the same"" I will receive back a new AI generated home, possibly with the correct railings but usually with distorted proportions. If I was starting with a blank canvas, the generative AI models would be very helpful. The issue is that the current generation will change the structure of the house significantly so that it's not the same as original photo. This creates images that aren't what the client is looking for so I can't use them for end stage design presentations.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the client needs to see *their* house with the changes, not a similar-looking house. So when you're working with AI in that brainstorming phase, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions when you're gathering those railing inspirations?

User: Typically I'm driving the design process but there is collaboration involved. I have ideas of the type of themes a client will like and what they will automatically veto. I use that information and market research on trending design themes to request certain styles and design choices to create an image portfolio or mood board for certain rooms. When I get stumped I'll tap AI and provide an image and ask for ideas of themes to try in different scenarios. From that brainstorming I'm usually able to go to the web and find realistic images I can use to photoshop into my original images.

AI: That's a helpful dynamic - using AI almost like a creative sounding board when you hit those stuck moments. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: It saves me time by helping to narrow down design options. For example, if I ask for examples of ""high-end exterior coastal railings"" I can get an idea of what I like and dislike. Then instead of browsing through tens of web pages looking through hundreds of pictures for any railing designs that are coastal-adjacent, I can quickly scan pages to find what I need for resource images. The generation from the models doesn't always come out realistic, often is slightly animated, but I've also had luck using Google lens to direct me to real images that are similar to the AI provided ideas.

AI: That's a smart workflow - using AI to help you identify what you're looking for, then finding the real-world versions. It sounds like you've found a way to work around some of the current limitations.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: AI is going to be a field disruptor for anyone in the remodeling space. I'm not someone who is professionally trained in this field but I have enough knowledge of AI manipulation and passable photoshop skills to be able to advise design choices on a remodeling project of a $3 million house. For my personal needs, most of the models could've produce what I needed but if someone is using it to creating generative images from scratch the outputs are very impressive. I can easily see someone paying about $30/month to create design inspiration for a new house versus paying significantly more for an interior designer in person. Although there are financial levels to this industry. Meaning, someone who could originally afford an interior designer might be someone who doesn't care to do the work and would pay to have it outsourced anyway. That high-end market will likely always be there. I see interior designers working on mid-low range projects being the first ones affected once this technology is more easily accessible.

AI: That's a really thoughtful analysis of how the economics might shift across different market segments. You mentioned that you're not professionally trained in this field but you're able to advise on significant projects - that's quite a testament to how AI can democratize certain capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As AI gets better I'd like to see it able to incorporated further down my production line to create full mock-ups. It's still new enough that I forget to use it sometimes for things that it could've made easier or faster but for the most part I've pushed the limits on what it can do for me. In the future, once the models are able to separate and manipulate individual aspects of an image I'd like to be able to provide thorough prompts of what I want changed in an image and receive exactly what I asked for. Photoshop is nice but it takes time and I'd like to see AI evolve in the image space to expand how I'm able to precisely edit images.

AI: Those are all really insightful perspectives you've shared about your experience with AI in design work. I particularly appreciated your point about how AI is democratizing access to design capabilities, and your realistic view of both its current limitations and future potential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered my pain points as well as its current uses.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative brainstorming partner while working around its current limitations, and your perspective on how it's changing the accessibility of design work across different market segments, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you walked me through your hybrid workflow - using AI for inspiration and then finding real-world resources to create the final client presentations. That kind of practical adaptation is exactly the type of insight we're hoping to understand better.

Thanks again for participating in our research!"
creativity_0104,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a freelance writer, editor, proofreader, you name it. I write my own articles on Medium, where I mostly publish about topics that interest me like philosophy, mental heal, literature and feminism. I sometimes write articles for other people, mostly ghost-written SEO content, although not so much nowadays. I also write creatively in my free time. I haven't done so yet, but I plan to submit my short stories for publication to literary journals and magazines. Sometimes, I take part in creative writing competitions (short stories and flash fiction). I take on editing/proofreading/beta reading projects whenever I can—this is where I have the most experience. Some of my work is paid, and some is voluntary. For example, right now, I am beta reading fiction for free as I wanted experience editing and providing feedback on fiction. Most of my paid work is for non-fiction and academic articles.

AI: That's a really diverse range of writing and editing work! It sounds like you're working across many different formats and audiences, from your own philosophical pieces to SEO content to creative fiction.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I try not to use it for anything to do with my writing. I prefer to use it for admin and some more mathematical issues like working out my taxes, earnings, savings, schedule, etc. Writers wrote before this tool was available, and my core desire is to be a good writer. I don't think AI can help me to become a better writer. At most, I'll use it for a final check before publication, or if I'm feeling bad about my writing, I might use it for a confidence boost. I won't let AI change or edit my writing, just provide feedback. And I only use this for blogging and never my creative fiction. As for editing, if I'm struggling with wording for feedback, I might use AI to help me reword feedback. I do this sparingly, however. I would use it to help my tone come across better when giving feedback so I don't offend authors.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've drawn some pretty clear boundaries around where AI does and doesn't belong in your work. You mentioned using it occasionally for feedback on your blog posts when you're feeling uncertain about your writing.

Tell me more about that. What does that process look like when you do use AI for that confidence boost or final check?

User: I would use it if I'm feeling unconfident about an article. I simply copy it into a chat and ask for feedback. I tell the model strictly not to edit or change anything, act as a reader and tell me what it 'thinks.'

AI: So you're essentially using it as a sounding board - getting that reader's perspective without letting it actually touch your work. 

When you get that feedback back, how do you typically respond to it? Do you find yourself making changes based on what the AI tells you, or is it more about just getting that external validation?

User: I take everything with a pinch of salt. Sometimes, it will tell me I've made mistakes which aren't really mistakes. For example, with grammar. LLMs love to remove sentence fragments I've noticed. However, natural, human-produced writing is not perfect and writers will use 'incorrect' grammar for effect all the time. I pay attention to feedback about perspectives I might have missed in my articles and consider if I need to add them. Most of the time, I would not add them as I've noticed LLMs are just trying to provide any content. Since they can't think like humans, often the feedback is not something I would ever need to add to an article. For example, if I am writing an article about feminism, I would not say I need to mention every possible intersecting factor.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how AI tends to suggest additions that aren't necessarily meaningful or relevant. It sounds like you've developed a pretty discerning filter for what feedback is actually useful versus what's just the AI trying to be comprehensive.

You mentioned earlier that you have a core desire to be a good writer and don't think AI can help with that. Can you elaborate on what being a good writer means to you and why you feel AI falls short in helping with that development?

User: I think being a good writer is all about understanding humanity, which LLMs are simply incapable of doing. I think that they're great help for technical writing, which requires a lot of grammatical and lexical accuracy; however, the nuances of creative writing are too complex. Every creative piece I have read, and even some more informational articles on sites like Medium, which has been written using AI has a very distinctive lack of depth. I think this is due to a lack of human-ness.

AI: That's a really compelling distinction you're making between technical accuracy and the deeper human understanding that drives meaningful writing. When you talk about that ""distinctive lack of depth"" and missing ""human-ness"" in AI-generated creative work - what specifically do you notice when you're reading something that tips you off that it was AI-assisted?

User: Writing that would be better suited to a more technical purpose. Humans will agonise for hours about selecting the 'right word' in their writing, which LMMs don't have to do (I'm no expert but I believe this is due to their inner statistical, predictive workings). You can tell work is human when you get a glimpse of just how much time and effort the author has put into perfecting each sentence, each word. AI writing is just too perfect, too simplistic to sound human.

AI: That's such a perceptive point about the agonizing over word choice - that struggle and deliberation being part of what makes writing distinctly human. The ""too perfect, too simplistic"" quality you describe is really interesting.

Given your strong boundaries around keeping AI out of your creative writing, what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's growing presence in your field more broadly? How do you see it affecting the writing landscape around you?

User: I think AI-assisted writing is ok. I think we have to get with the times and be realistic about its place in our world. It's a good thing for some. Technical writing can be boring and soul-sucking. I'm not concerned that it will take my place as a creative writer. It may mean I have fewer jobs as an editor, but I also don't think that's a bad thing. There will always be a place for human writers and editors. Humans can provide insight that AI will just never be able to. For example, I am currently beta reading a novel. I can tell it has been written with AI, even though the author hasn't told me. What I bring to this author is the ability to see the human gaps that the AI has missed. The novel does not consider the human reader much, neglecting setting and characterisation. It's missing the subtleties that human writers have been contributing to literature for centuries.

AI: That's fascinating that you can detect the AI assistance in that novel you're beta reading. It sounds like your role as an editor is actually evolving to help fill in those ""human gaps"" - helping writers see where the AI-assisted work lacks those subtle human touches around setting and characterization.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate your boundaries shifting at all, or do you think you'll maintain this current approach?

User: I hope, in some ways, it could be a positive for me. I suspect once all the hype is over, and many people will have lost writing skills, preferring to use LLMs to generate their writing, human writing will have more prestige. My boundaries won't shift because I love writing so much. It would be no fun if a computer got to do it all. I don't even really want to use it for idea generation, because I don't want to write things that don't add anything to the world. Right now, AI is only capable of remixing what's already out there, and I think I'm better off learning to generate ideas on my own. It definitely has a place as more of a writing assistant I feel. I wouldn't use it for research or anything because, again, I enjoy doing that myself too much. But I would use it for quick spelling checks, dictionary definitions, thesaurus purposes, as a little hype-man, etc.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how human writing might actually gain prestige as AI becomes more common, and your observation about being able to identify and help fill in the ""human gaps"" in AI-assisted work when you're editing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining the human elements in creative writing - that deliberate word choice, the agonizing over perfection, and the deep understanding of humanity that drives meaningful work - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've considered where AI does and doesn't fit in your creative process, and your perspective on the evolving landscape for writers and editors. Thanks again!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, ready to go

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am producing a non-profit documentary about nature and have the responsibility of researching a lot of preliminary information having to do with pre-production (e.g. the development of the film treatment, information about fiscal sponsors, budgetary planning, film festival timelines, etc.)

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful project. Nature documentaries can have such a powerful impact.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Any time I need an answer that would take too long or be too difficult to find on Google

AI: Tell me more about that. What kinds of questions or research challenges does AI help you tackle that Google doesn't handle as well?

User: Here's an example: trying to determine how much licensed archival footage costs on average would be almost impossible on Google, because I would be faced with advertisements, disparate information, and overviews that don't give me the level of specificity needed to answer the question. That's what I think AI models are best at - synthesizing information into a clear, direct, and coherent response that saves me a lot of time.

AI: That's a really concrete example - I can see how getting that kind of synthesized, specific information would be much more efficient than sifting through search results.

Can you describe a specific recent project or task where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you were working through it?

User: This is a more creative application, but I needed to generate a cover for the film treatment and I used an AI model to help generate the images that I then positioned in a specific way in order to create the scene (they were plants and small animals that adhered to a very specific aesthetic style). I've found that when requesting something like this, you need to be very specific and explain the most important elements that you want. Then, once a style has been established, the model does a great job of replicating that style across all subsequent prompts (if requested)

AI: That's fascinating - you're describing a really collaborative approach where you're directing the visual elements but letting AI handle the execution within your established style.

When you're working with AI in situations like that cover creation, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am, because I know exactly what I want, so I'm asking the model to initially generate to my specifications and then iterate / refine based on my feedback

AI: That's a clear sense of creative control you're describing. It sounds like you see AI as more of a sophisticated tool that executes your vision rather than a creative partner that's contributing its own ideas.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The speed with which I'm able to complete things (as one example, it's made graphic design a lot faster and easier)

AI: That efficiency gain sounds significant. When you think about that increased speed - particularly in areas like graphic design - how has that affected the quality or depth of your creative work? Are you able to explore more ideas, or does it change your process in other ways?

User: The quality of what I'm able to produce is higher on the whole because generating something based on my instructions is far more effective than querying for something based on my parameters.

AI: That's an interesting distinction - generating versus querying. It sounds like having AI create something to your exact specifications gives you more control over the outcome than searching for something that already exists.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in documentary filmmaking more broadly?

User: None, because documentaries rely on capturing real-world footage. I only see AI as a tool that allows for more efficient work on behalf of smaller teams, not a threat to the end product.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the core of documentary work is still that real-world capture that AI can't replace.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Are there areas where you'd want to see it become more capable, or ways you might use it differently?

User: Perhaps more specific or specialized applications. Instead of running these requests through a general chatbot, I would be able to use something that's already fine-tuned for the specific task at hand. More consistency in the quality of the output would be the main way I'd want to see it become more capable. Sometimes it falls into feedback loops of quality degradation where the desired creation gets worse instead of better despite very thoughtful commentary. It often seems like the AI's first creation is its best.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the quality degradation in iterative feedback - it sounds frustrating when you're trying to refine something and it actually gets worse despite clear direction.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as an efficient synthesis tool for complex research questions, and your clear sense of maintaining creative control while leveraging AI's execution capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's it, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for research synthesis, the efficiency gains in graphic design, and especially that observation about quality degradation in iterative feedback will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how clearly you articulated your approach to maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as a sophisticated execution tool. Best of luck with your nature documentary - it sounds like a wonderful project!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good. Let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: It is quite varied really. I am a writer and will often just work on my own writing projects, usually for screen, although I have also just finished my first novel. I will then try to sell or option these works. Sometimes I am writing full scripts, other time one-sheets or treatments, and other times I will be paid to write a script for someone else rather than creating my own story from scratch. For screenwriting I often work with a writing partner.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic mix of work - from original novel writing to collaborative screenwriting and everything in between. The variety of formats you work with is interesting too, from full scripts down to treatments and one-sheets.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sometimes it is just for proofreading or recommending edits, other times it will be for art or design for a one-sheet and other times it will be for research to short cut when I need some obscure or arcane information that would be hard to find without speaking to an expert or that might be overly time consuming for limited benefit.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using AI for those efficiency gains rather than core creative decisions. The research piece is particularly interesting since screenwriting often requires getting those specific details right.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently we were preparing a one-sheet for an idea that we had not fully fleshed out. We looked at using AI for design but utilising free tools did not give us the quality we needed. We also asked for a precis of our idea but ended up using that. In the end the only thing we used AI for was to come up with alternatives for a closing sentence that we just couldn't quite get right.

AI: That's a fascinating example - it sounds like you experimented with AI in a few different ways but ultimately found its most valuable contribution was quite targeted. You mentioned you didn't end up using the precis AI generated of your idea.

Tell me more about that - what was it about the AI's summary that didn't work for you?

User: It felt a little rushed and didn't have the right personality for the genre of project. It felt a little lifeless. We have used it before to offer suggestions for a one-pager and foudn the results were great and gave us inspiration for redrafting but in this case, it served a different purpose and made us realise that our current one-sheet synopsis was already working very well.

AI: That's really insightful - so the AI's attempt actually served as a mirror that helped you recognize the strength of what you'd already created. It sounds like there's something about capturing the right tone and personality for specific genres that can be tricky for AI to nail.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I always try to drive creative decisions. For me, I like to use it to hone ideas I have already worked on rather than developing ideas. Where it comes in more useful creatively is asking targeted questions about the reality of a situation - the information I can glean from these conversations might make me approach a scene, a beat or an entire arc differently if I find out my assumptions were correct, and so it can guide creativity in that way, but only as a result of using it to interrogate my own awareness and assumptions.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - using AI to interrogate your assumptions rather than generate the creative core. It sounds like you're maintaining creative authorship while leveraging AI as almost a research partner or sounding board.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Research is the main one. However, during my novel, using it as a copy editor made redrafting far faster. It is hard to be subjective when it is somethine you have written recently, and having a second pair of ""eyes"" can allow me to more quickly have distance and see things that I would likely have edited with more objective view point but further down the line. It means the second draft can now be the quality that a third draft might have been.

AI: That's a compelling benefit - essentially compressing your editing cycles and getting to higher quality drafts faster. The idea of AI providing that objective distance you'd normally only get with time is really interesting.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have a few. I am not worried about AI but its implementation. I think too many people will start to assume that AI can just take the job of a writer, rather than being a tool that a writer can use to improve their work or streamline the process. It seems that AI is about iteration not creation, and unless we reach the point of AGI, we might end up in a place ingenuity is lost and switched out for faster, cheaper iterative content. The other concern is the flooding of the market. People who are not writers but have a fun idea might suddenly be able to write something that they never would have been able to in the past, meaning suddenly every complany is receiving 100 x more content, and being able to even get read might be tricky.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - the distinction you draw between AI as iteration versus creation is particularly striking. It sounds like you're worried about both a devaluation of the craft itself and a kind of market saturation where genuine writers get lost in the noise.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I hope to keep it much the same. A useful tool I can employ when it is needed, but not too often. I think it is important for me to not reply on it too much, to keep my brain sharp and to make sure I am being as original as I can. I hope to use it to make things look better, to check my figurative homework and to aid me in improving accuracy (through research) and helping me create more by making better use of my time (or perhaos just being able to have a little more time off!)

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - using AI to enhance your capabilities while being intentional about maintaining your creative muscles. The goal of having more time off by being more efficient is refreshingly honest too!

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI being about iteration rather than creation, and how you use it to interrogate your own assumptions rather than generate ideas.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I find it most rewarding using AI when I know it is not affecting anything outside of my usage of it. For instance, I always used to design my own one-sheets. I am not good at design though, so it helps to make these look much better, but it is not taking work from anyone else. With research, I was not employing a researcher, and instead was doing my own research and now I can get there much quicker. So I hope that others might approach utilising AI in the same way - getting better results and making the most of their own time without utilising it to just do away with important jobs (jobs they might not even realise are vital). I think the results will be better that way too, so my hope is it becomes an important tool, but not a replacement for the artists whose ingenuity remains vitally important.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea of using AI in spaces where you were already doing the work yourself rather than replacing other people's roles. It sounds like you've found a way to think about AI integration that's both practically beneficial and ethically conscious.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authorship while leveraging AI as a targeted tool, and your thoughtful approach to where and how you deploy it, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your candor about both the benefits and the concerns you have about AI in your field.

User: Thanks!

User: I sell clothing online, whether that be thrifted or handmade. The handmade pieces are either knit or crochet—the most popular are sweaters and hats. Handmade projects take quite some time to complete and are often quite complex, but I'm always up for a challenge.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting mix of work! I can imagine the handmade pieces especially require a lot of skill and patience.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: When starting a project, sometimes I need help estimating how much yarn I'll need. I'll send information regarding the size of needles/hooks I plan to use, the weight of the yarn, what size I want the piece to be, and it will give me a close estimate. I also use AI if I get confused with the pattern and need some expertise on it. Additionally, I occasionally use AI to help me word messages to buyers regarding items they're interested in.

AI: That's really helpful to understand where AI comes into play for you. It sounds like you're using it for some pretty practical problem-solving.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I'm currently knitting a sweater, and I needed some advice on how large I should make the arms if I want it to fit slightly oversized on a size medium. I gave information on the weight of the yarn, the size of the needles, and how many stitches I used for the front panel, and it gave me a helpful suggestion.

AI: Tell me more about that experience with getting advice on the arm sizing. How did you feel about the suggestion AI gave you, and how confident were you in following it?

User: I've used AI in the past to help with precise knitting questions, and it often gives more general answers to avoid wrongful suggestions, so I was a little reluctant. However, I tried out casting on a number of stitches at the higher end of the range it suggested and the result so far seems to be working well.

AI: That's really interesting that you've noticed AI tends to give more general answers for knitting questions. When you're working with AI in these situations, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I often tell the AI what I'm aiming for, such as cable knit patterns or 1x1 ribbing, and it'll take that into consideration when answering my questions, often incorporating tips throughout the conversation that tie back to previous creative information I've provided.

AI: What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think I'm a bit more confident in my skills now. I taught myself how to knit and crochet, so having AI to answer precise questions is like having a teacher on hand to help me navigate it all. Since I'm more confident, I've found myself leaning towards more complex pieces. For example, I used to only make hats and simple tank tops, and now I can make granny square bucket hats and fisherman sweaters to sell!

AI: That's wonderful that AI has helped boost your confidence to tackle those more complex projects! The progression from simple tank tops to fisherman sweaters sounds like quite a leap.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Not many, to be honest! In fact, I can't even think of one. It's different than if I had a job in accounting or something, you know?

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - that it feels different from other fields like accounting. Tell me more about that. What makes your creative work feel different in terms of AI's impact?

User: Well, it's not like inputting numbers all day into spreadsheets and all that, it's a handmade piece of clothing with intricate detail.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see AI becoming more specialized in certain fields. It may have more expertise to offer in marketing items for sale on my storefront, including detailing various strategies and plans, and it may have more advanced knowledge that can help in creating my handmade pieces that may lead to more certainty and preciseness in its answers.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has boosted your confidence to take on more complex projects - that progression from simple pieces to fisherman sweaters really illustrates how AI can serve as that ""teacher on hand"" you mentioned.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's it, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. It's been really fascinating to hear how you've used AI as a learning tool to build confidence and tackle increasingly complex projects. I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!"
creativity_0108,"Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a musician, so my projects range from producing to songwriting and everything in between.

AI: That's fascinating - music spans so many different creative disciplines. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find myself asking AI for help when I have too many ideas running and need help sorting them into one. For example, when I have a couple of different ideas for the vibes of the song, or even when trying to mix genres, I ask AI to give me ideas of similar artists or songs, or even ask if it's something that could work.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a kind of creative compass when you're in that abundant but overwhelming idea space. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Again, I had many ideas going for a song, and I used AI to confirm that it would be possible to mix these genres, and got confirmation that other artists experimented with these sounds as well. It made me feel more confident in what I thought were ""chaotic ideas."" I also used it to generate a list of words that reminded me of a specific visual that I was then able to write from. It made my process flow smoother because I sort of hit a wall and couldn't really find the right words I was looking for.

AI: That's really compelling - it sounds like AI helped you both validate your creative instincts and break through a creative block. You mentioned it made your ""chaotic ideas"" feel more legitimate.

When you're working with AI in these moments, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I would say I was driving the creative decisions because I was inputting all of my own ideas; I just needed some help untangling the different aspects of things, such as the themes, the aesthetic, and the sound. The AI was certainly an aid, but I didn't pull straight up AI ideas from it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you're maintaining creative ownership while using AI more as a thinking partner to help organize and validate what's already coming from you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It's less time-consuming because I don't have to sit in a creative block. I know I can throw ideas into the AI system, and it can generate something that combines all of my thinking into one solid song or idea. I try not to use it much because I think it's important to be very personal in music, but I think it's a great aid to help navigate your creative process when it's in the beginning stages.

AI: That's a really thoughtful balance you've struck - using it strategically in those early brainstorming phases while preserving the personal elements that are so crucial to music. You mentioned being mindful not to use it too much because of the importance of keeping music personal.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Music and art are something that is so human and personal, and I am worried that AI will start to generate music and that people will start to lose that personal aspect to it that makes music so wonderful. Every human experience is different and felt differently, therefore making art and music such an impactful thing. Artists are able to encapsulate their feelings into words and music, and I'm fearful that we'll eventually start losing that.

AI: That's such a profound concern - the idea that we might lose that deeply human element that makes music so moving and connective. The way you describe artists encapsulating their unique human experiences really gets to the heart of what makes music powerful.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would like to think I'd keep my stance with not overusing it and only trying to use it as an aid rather than something to completely generate beats or lyrics. I think I would use it the way I use it now, and just try to combine my own ideas.

AI: That's a really clear vision - maintaining AI as a creative aid rather than a creative replacement. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your music-making process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you navigate those moments when you have too many ideas swirling around, and your commitment to preserving the deeply personal aspects that make music so human and impactful.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I believe we covered a good amount of information.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative compass while maintaining the personal authenticity that makes music so powerful will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your workflow - that balance between leveraging its organizational capabilities while preserving the deeply human elements of your art. Best of luck with your music projects!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds fine, I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do a variety of creative work. I am self-employed and do graphic and web design. I help my husband with his web comic. I create assets for live streamers, and I create my own content as a vtuber. So projects can vary widely depending on what I am working on.

AI: That's quite a diverse range of creative work! It sounds like you're juggling multiple different types of projects regularly.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I usually find myself using AI for initial iteration and brainstorming. For example I might tell it that I am planning a stream on a particular topic and ask for suggestion for assets to promote that stream. Or I might be developing a flyer for a graphic design client and ask for information on font styles. I often use AI assistance within Photoshop to clean up small issues in an image, like the smart fill to remove a defect from a background. Occasionally I will use AI image gen to give me inspiration on color palettes or basic layouts for a design that I can use to base my own designs on. I frequently use Udio to create lo-fi background music for my live streams. And I use ChatGPT almost daily for executive function related tasks like to-do lists or breaking down big projects into smaller pieces. I have ADHD, so having a LLM as my executive assistant really helps me complete projects I might lose track of otherwise, or prioritizing what things to work on first.

AI: That's really fascinating how you've integrated AI across so many different aspects of your workflow - from the creative brainstorming all the way through to project management. The executive function support you mentioned sounds particularly valuable.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Sure, I am helping my husband develop a TCG (trading card game) based off of an original IP. Neither of us really know a ton about TCGs, and I have only casually played a couple like Hearthstone and Pokemon. I used AI to assist me in talking through our ideas for the game and how to make the rules and gameplay loop unique while still keeping things familiar and easy to pick up for those who play a lot of TCGs. Over the course of a couple of days, it helped me refine our ideas into a full v1 draft of a rule book with all the basic card types and how they work planned out. My next step in that project is to use AI to help me create a spread sheet of different ability effects frequently found on cards in games like these, so I can adapt them to our game's lore and start making a card list as the next step.

AI: That's a really interesting example of using AI to help you learn and navigate an unfamiliar domain. It sounds like the AI served almost like a knowledgeable collaborator who could help you think through the mechanics and conventions of TCG design.

When you're working with AI like that - whether it's on the TCG project or other creative work - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am always in charge of the conversation. I've given custom instructions to my ChatGPT that relate to how I think and how I best navigate my ADHD, so I am able to give it very targeted instructions or ask questions and it knows to focus exclusively on the task at hand first before going off onto tangents with follow-ups that might get me sidetracked before we've completed what I'm working on. It does ask me questions, but they are always relevant to what we're currently discussing, and always very focused on a specific aspect of that task instead of broad or vague.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've been quite intentional about customizing the AI to work with your thinking style and needs. The way you describe staying in control of the creative direction while having the AI ask focused, relevant questions suggests a pretty refined working relationship.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I am much more productive. I feel  more able to simultaneously tackle multiple different things at once, especially because I can compartmentalize different tasks within different conversations or project folders for easy reference and to avoid losing track of what the task at hand is through topic changes. I have another ""mode"" I've defined for my model that acts more as a mentor/coach instead of a collaborator. If I ask the model to act in that mode, I can show it drafts or completed work and it will give honest and not sugar-coated feedback on the project and how it achieves my stated goals for it. This is extremely useful because I am my own worst critic and will constantly self-edit and iterate if I'm not careful, and I've learned to trust the model when it tells me, ""it's good, leave it alone!""

AI: That's really compelling - having that external voice to help you step back from the perfectionist cycle and recognize when something is finished. It sounds like the AI has become almost like having multiple specialized team members available when you need them.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Unlike many people in the creative field, I don't have the same fears that some of them do about AI taking away our jobs. No matter how good an image gen model gets, it cannot ""beat"" human creativity. Sure, people may be able to pump out memes or generic ""art"" with it, but I firmly believe that true art is sparked by something deep within the soul that AI can only imitate. If more creatives embrace the use of AI in different ways to streamline their workflows, I think many of them would find it quite useful in the long run.

AI: That's a really refreshing perspective, and it sounds like you see AI more as a tool that can amplify human creativity rather than replace it. Your point about AI being able to imitate but not truly create from that deeper place resonates with how you've been using it - as support for your own creative vision rather than as the source of creativity itself.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I will probably continue to use AI in much the same way that I do currently, adapting to what new things models are able to do and finding ways to implement them into my workflow. I agree with your previous summary, I like to use AI to amplify my own creative vision and while I can't predict what will change in the next five years as far as the technology and what it can do, I can pretty confidently say that the methodology in HOW I use AI won't change much, even if the tools and the tasks do.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've found a methodology that works well for you, where you maintain creative control while leveraging AI's capabilities to enhance your productivity and process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as something that amplifies rather than replaces human creativity, and how you've customized it to work with your ADHD to become more productive across all those different types of projects you're juggling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so, thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a productivity amplifier, the importance of maintaining creative control, and how you've adapted the technology to work with your specific needs and thinking style will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's do it!

AI: Great! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work focuses on content creation and design. For example , ghost writing a blog for my client about her makeup brand including tutorials, or like yesterday, it's meant creating PowerPoint slides for a company's marketing campaign proposals. Usually,  my work means that I will receive a file of info and need to filter, organize, format, and create another kind of content with it.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of creative work - from beauty tutorials to marketing presentations. It sounds like you're constantly transforming information from one format into something completely different.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: There is always a specific goal that the company has in mind for a project and I'm either provided with an overload of information (60% of which is not relatable), or I'm receive too little info and need to be creative, yet accurate in statements, to fill in the space. In these cases, I reach for AI because it is a huge time-saver. I use it to sort through and compile the connected info to the task at hand and to adjust word/character count and formatting. Sometimes I receive a project in a category/on a topic that I have no previous knowledge of or little understanding of, so in these cases I reach for AI so I can ensure that what I put together does align with the company's objective for that content. Oh, and I should mention I'm a freelancer. That's why I'll end up working with a variety of  topics. If I receive too little info to work with but have a requested content length, then I use AI to get creative and fill in the gaps, while still ensuring that everything stated is accurate

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI becomes your go-to tool for both information overload and information scarcity situations. I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about ensuring accuracy when filling in gaps creatively.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: For example, a client asked me to write makeup blogs for her products. Of these, a few times I was only provided with a picture and the name of the product. 700 words based on just that?? So, I used AI to brainstorm and compile info about the company (its objectives, history, ingredients, etc). The blog needed to have depth and accuracy of statement, not ""fluff"" or non confirmed statements, and so I brought in AI to help fill in the gaps creatively with what a consumer would find ""trustworthy"" information

AI: That's a fascinating example - going from just a product photo and name to a 700-word blog post that needs to be both engaging and trustworthy. It sounds like you were really relying on AI to help you understand the broader context around that product.

When you're working with AI in situations like that makeup blog, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I feel in control of the collaboration. I give AI the parameters and its focus  point and it usually works within that. Some of the suggestions it'll provide are hit-or-miss aligned with the parameters it was given, but there's always something that is useful.

AI: That's interesting that you feel in control despite sometimes getting suggestions that miss the mark. It sounds like you're actively filtering and curating what AI gives you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: When it comes to copywriting, I've found that it's slowly changing my focus when creating content. I uses to think more about how the content would impact/move the viewer, but now I find myself more focused on making sure it doesn't read like AI was involved. Obviously, using AI makes everything easier and more efficient, so I find myself being lazy and less able to work create on my own like I had in the past. I feel like this effects the outcome of the work because I'm not as involved in the process of trying to create that connection of the audience with the content.

AI: That's a really honest and thoughtful reflection. It sounds like there's a real tension there - AI is making your work more efficient, but you're noticing it's changing how you approach the creative connection with your audience. You mentioned feeling ""less able to work create on my own"" - that sounds like something you've really noticed about yourself.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: AI will one day replace me! hahah

AI: Ha! I can hear that you're laughing, but I imagine there might be some real feelings behind that joke too.

Tell me more about that - when you think about AI potentially replacing you, what specifically comes to mind?

User: Even those with specialized training and skills, say computer science and coding for example, AI is even able to do their job (speaking generally here, not absolutely). So then you have someone like me, who just has my creativity, ability to write engaging content, and can create nice PowerPoints - no special education or skills - yet I've found this as a means to work and support myself. There's nothing stopping AI from eventually putting me out of work in these projects

AI: That's a really genuine concern, and I appreciate you sharing that vulnerability with me. It sounds like you're thinking about what makes your work uniquely valuable when AI can handle so much of what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Society is constantly evolving and this creates new needs and new opportunities. I believe that as long as I keep adapting, I'll be better able to incorporate using AI into my work and continue creating various forms of content in different fields.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to look at it - focusing on adaptation rather than resistance. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your honesty about how AI has changed your focus from connecting with audiences to ensuring content doesn't read as AI-generated, and your genuine concerns about the future while maintaining an adaptive mindset.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's it! Thanks for the chat :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for being so open and thoughtful in sharing your experiences. Your insights about navigating the balance between efficiency and authentic creative connection, along with your perspective on adaptation in an evolving field, will be incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Okay! I don't have any questions so far.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work as professional freelance copy and content writer. I write ads for clients, landing pages, blog posts, write some for social media, a lot of different things. A typical project includes every step from brainstorming the idea with the client, to extensive competitor research, to creating the ad/web page/blog, proofreading/editing, and finalizing all deliverables.

AI: That sounds like a really comprehensive process with a lot of different moving parts. I can see how you're involved from the very beginning conceptual stages all the way through to the final polish.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I usually lean on AI for the brainstorming and research portion, and then again for the proof-reading and editing.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does the brainstorming and research look like when you're using AI?

User: If I'm starting a new project, like a blog for example, and the topic is rather broad, I'll first tell AI the general outline for the project I have in my head and ask the model to identify any gaps and expand on my outline.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using it almost like a thought partner to help you see what you might be missing. When you get that feedback from the AI about gaps or expansions, how do you work with those suggestions? Do you typically take them as-is, or do they spark other ideas for you?

User: Usually, I'll have them incorporated into the outline with a little bit of personal tweaking. Then I'll continue the process until I feel like I have a full outline. Often, the AI is TOO comprehensive for my required word counts and I find myself cutting out bits of the outline as I actually write the piece.

AI: That's a really practical insight - that the AI tends to be overly thorough for your actual needs. So it sounds like you're using it to generate more possibilities than you'll actually use, then you're the one making the editorial decisions about what to keep.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently, I wrote an entire landing page for a brand new health teach startup that had just launched their new health tracking app and community platform. I had NO idea what beats I should hit on the final landing page, it was the first time I had written one in this niche or for this type of product, so I first had the AI assistant outline a basic skeleton for the page. And then as I started filling in areas, sent my finished text back to be polished and placed into the outline. As I wrote, the outline started to evolve.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic process - almost like the AI was helping you navigate unfamiliar territory at first, but then you took the lead as you got more comfortable with the project. 

When you say the outline started to evolve as you wrote, tell me more about that. Was that you making those changes, or were you bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI?

User: I would realize the next section of the outline was too broad or too deeply technical, and I would issue the corrections to the model. Then I would write the section based off the updated outline.

AI: So you were really driving those refinements - recognizing when something wasn't quite right for the audience or scope and directing the AI to adjust. 

When you're working with AI this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm definitely in charge of all of the creative decisions. The AI assistant helps out, but it doesn't really suggest anything new or innovative. I have to be the one driving the project and identifying when the outline no longer fits my purpose.

AI: That's a really clear perspective - you see yourself as firmly in the driver's seat. You mentioned that AI doesn't suggest anything new or innovative. What do you think it does bring to the table then? What's valuable about having it in your process?

User: It really speeds up the entire process. Plus, because I work as a freelancer, I spend the bulk of my working hours alone without any outside interaction. I find the AI assistant incredibly valuable for bouncing ideas off of and for really having something to talk through roadblocks with. But I don't have the AI actually do the writing for me.

AI: That's fascinating - so beyond the practical efficiency gains, it's also serving as a kind of creative companion when you're working in isolation. The social aspect of having something to think through problems with seems really important.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I find myself starting at a blank page WAY less than I did before. I used to find the hardest part of the process getting started, but AI really helps me get something onto the page. Even if its an outline I don't really end up using, it helps me start getting my thoughts flowing.

AI: That's such a relatable challenge - that intimidating blank page! It sounds like AI has become a really effective way to break through that initial creative paralysis, even when what it produces isn't your final direction.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I read online ALL the time about how AI assistants are going to make jobs like mine completely obsolete. I love writing and it is really my passion. I am nervous that AI might make it so my job no longer includes much writing and instead will be a whole lot more editing and prompting. 

Plus, AI is not always truthful. I worry it may start hurting human writer's credibility.

AI: Those are really understandable concerns. The idea that the core thing you're passionate about - the actual writing - might get squeezed out in favor of more editing and prompting sounds genuinely worrying. And that credibility issue is interesting too.

When you think about that potential shift toward more editing and prompting, what would that mean for you personally? How would that feel different from the work you do now?

User: Since, I now have experience training AI models and working with them extensively I hope I will be able to transition into one of those new editing and prompting roles easily. But it will take some of the fun and creativity out of my job. I'll get to do less thinking and have fewer original ideas.

AI: That tension is really striking - you recognize you'd likely be well-positioned for that transition given your experience, but at the cost of what makes the work fulfilling for you in the first place. The ""less thinking and fewer original ideas"" part seems like it would fundamentally change the nature of what draws you to this work.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Yeah, definitely. Just in the few years I've trained AI, I've seen it change so much. Where models used to struggle with short form blogs, they now blow some junior or untrained writers out of the water. I see AI eliminating a lot of entry roles and leaving space only for the folks, like myself, who have learned how to leverage this technology.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about how the bar has shifted so quickly. It sounds like you see a future where working effectively with AI becomes an essential skill rather than just a nice-to-have.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as both a practical tool for overcoming creative blocks and a kind of creative companion when you're working alone, while you maintain clear creative control.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yeah, I think it's really important to draw attention to the fact that writing needs a human element to really connect with readers. People can spot AI because it isn't capable of adding that distinctly human element to the text. AI text still requires so much refinement to sound truly human.

AI: That's such an important point - that human connection and authenticity that readers can sense. It sounds like you see that as something AI fundamentally can't replicate, no matter how sophisticated it gets technically.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as a collaborative tool, the concerns about the evolution of writing roles, and especially that point about the irreplaceable human element in connecting with readers - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your candor about both the benefits and the genuine concerns you have about where this is all heading.

User: No problem

AI: Thank you so much! Have a great rest of your day, and best of luck with your creative work."
creativity_0112,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's go!

AI: Great! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Of course. I am an illustrator who currently focuses on medieval-woodcut inspired pen and ink illustrations. I sell prints online, in person at local art markets, and I accept commissions. I have been a working artist for over a decade now. I have previously worked 4 years as a professional tattoo artist, taking appointments and walk-in clientele, with a focus on American Traditional style tattoos. My typical projects are usually punk and nature inspired imagery, done with staedtler 1.2mm pens on paper, though I am looking to branch out into dip pens or even linocut/woodblock printing as my business grows.

AI: That's fascinating - I can really picture the aesthetic you're working with, combining that medieval woodcut style with punk and nature themes. The transition from tattooing to illustration sounds like an interesting journey too.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use a lot of large language models for assistance with website copy, drafting artist statements, brainstorming social media marketing, and sometimes (though rarely) illustration ideas. Basically, the more tedious and less creative parts of running an art business. I would rather be spending my time drawing. I will tap into an AI tool maybe a few times a week for creative assistance.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to handle the business side so you can focus on the actual drawing. It sounds like you've carved out pretty clear boundaries about where AI fits in.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I launched a new brand in June, so I had AI draft my website copy for me, though I did go in and edit it to sound more like my personal voice. I am a bit shy about admitting my use of AI to other creatives in my industry. Otherwise, most recently, I've put together some art supply lists.

AI: That's really interesting that you mention feeling shy about admitting AI use to other creatives. Tell me more about that - what's driving that feeling for you?

User: I understand that the use of AI does require a lot of environmental resources, and large scale data centers popping up are using a ton of fresh water and electricity. I'm very much concerned about climate change and its effects, so I do sometimes feel bad using it for quick jobs. However, I also recognize that there is a lot of incredible potential with certain AI tools. I hope in the near future, these environmental concerns can be addressed.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - weighing the practical benefits against those environmental concerns. It sounds like there's some internal tension there for you.

When you are working with AI on things like website copy or brainstorming, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I have a pretty clear idea of how I want my ""brand"" to look, what tone I'd like to use, and the style I'm looking to portray. But my mind isn't an endless well of creativity, sometimes I need that extra push to jumpstart my creative endeavors, and if I ask AI to lean into a certain voice (like, make my copy sound like a wizard, but more professional and less campy) I know that I can glean some ideas that I otherwise might have struggled to achieve on my own. Could I spend a lot of time simply googling and writing and editing on my own? Sure, but I'd much rather have a little extra help and save that time for my illustration.

AI: That wizard example is great - it really shows how you're using AI as a creative collaborator while staying firmly in the driver's seat. You're giving it very specific direction about tone and style.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Definitely perfecting my branding. I prefer to use my own natural brain to come up with illustration ideas, and I almost exclusively use large language models rather than image-generating models. But it's been a super helpful tool to make my website, my social media, and my business plan look and feel exactly how I want it to, and it's all cohesive. That's been the biggest impact for sure.

AI: That cohesiveness across all your business materials sounds like a huge win. It's interesting how AI has helped you nail down that brand voice and consistency.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Going back to the image-generating models, I am very concerned that AI-generated art will have a huge effect on my field. I think we're already seeing a lot of bad press about AI being trained on certain artists' work without their consent, and used to replicate their styles. I am concerned that people will gravitate towards the ease-of-use of image-generating models without considering the importance of art made with a human hand. I am also concerned about AI-generated images being used as reference material when it might contain glaring inaccuracies- imagine I ask for a tattoo design and I don't realize my portrait has six fingers. This might have already happened by now, who knows. Yikes. I'd rather the role of AI be used to reduce the tedious workload of humanity so that we have enough time to focus on making art, writing poetry, etc.

AI: That six-finger tattoo scenario is both funny and genuinely concerning! Your vision of AI handling tedious work so humans can focus on art and poetry really resonates - it sounds like that's exactly how you're trying to use it in your own practice.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Well, I think I will stick to the large language models for myself and my work, personally. I don't think I will ever transition into using image or video-generating models. At least not with the current environmental impacts. I do hope humanity and AI can learn to coexist in a way that's beneficial. But in my personal work, I will continue to use AI to refine my brand, take the annoyances out of keeping inventory, build restock lists, manage my website, and give me advice to push my content out into this whacky world wide web.

AI: That's a really clear vision - using AI as your business assistant while keeping the creative work firmly in your own hands. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to handle the business side so you can focus on what you love most - the actual drawing - and your nuanced view of the environmental concerns balanced against the practical benefits.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that clear boundary between AI as a business tool versus keeping the creative work human, along with your thoughtful approach to the environmental considerations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been really fascinating to hear how you've carved out such a intentional role for AI in your practice. Best of luck with your illustration work and that potential expansion into linocut and woodblock printing!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a multi-disciplinary creative. I come from a family of artists. I am a film maker by profession. My skills revolve around shooting and editing digital footage. I have worked on a range of projects from feature films, documentaries, music videos, ads and online content. Recently I have also completed professional programs in VFX and Technical Arts. 

A typical project depends on the type. If it is a film or video project, it involves logging and cataloguing footage first. Then I build a narrative based on the story. The creative element comes in cutting clips together into a coherent story. There is a distinct visual grammar that changes with each edit, and this evolves as the narrative is crafted. It is one of the more dynamic and challenging natures of film montage.

For 3D projects such as personal artwork and game development, I first gain an understanding of the brief and then I proceed with creating 3D models along with textures. The detail in these artworks depends on the use case. There will be a higher poly count for personal artwork, but a lower poly count with more optimization for game engines. It all starts with a 3D doodle, which I then slowly refine into the finished work.

As a creative my first priority is to get into the mindset of the brief and to develop a workflow that lets art evolve into the finished piece.

AI: That's fascinating - you have such a diverse range of creative skills across film, VFX, and 3D work. I can see how each medium would require its own distinct approach and workflow.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find myself constantly using AI. Many 3D art pieces are based on realistic measurements and there are certain terms that help define what I need to make or what I need to illustrate. For example, for a project creating a realistic camera lens, I used AI to obtain the measurements of a micro 4/3 mount. In another project, I needed the history of medieval times to understand their architecture and what was relevant during certain time periods.

I have also used AI for help in coding python tools within Maya. It is very helpful when I am stuck and need another perspective. Coming from a non-coding background, as an artist working with complex software, this is immensely helpful in automating certain tasks. It also helps to troubleshoot issues within creative software.

The most useful AI has been is in learning new techniques. I would simply ask how to do a certain task in a software, and it would detail the process saving me a lot of time.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become almost like having a research assistant and technical mentor available at any moment. You mentioned using it for everything from historical research to Python coding to learning new software techniques.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I am working on a sci-fi watch project. Another useful thing about AI is that it can help filling in gaps or weaknesses in a skill-set. I am not as good in setting up and composing or laying out a scene. With AI I was able to get some quick mock-ups and concepts of how I can place objects. While it is not perfect, this is what makes it more 'human,' where there is deliberation and re-iteration through the process.

AI: That's a really compelling way to think about it - using AI to fill in gaps in your skillset and the imperfection actually making the process feel more human through that back-and-forth iteration.

When you're working with AI on something like those scene compositions for your sci-fi watch project, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: It is always me who is driving the creative process. At the end of the day, it's not about the final artwork, it's about growing through my craft and seeking enjoyment and fulfillment. There is a lot of information and data as to what goes into good composition, and while my technical skills with composition and layout need stronger development, my sensibility as an artist and what looks appealing will always be stronger.

AI is like the buddy on my shoulder, my R2D2. It's there when I need it, when I need to fill in those blanks, and it's sometimes reassuring to know it's there when exploring uncharted territory.

AI: I love that R2D2 analogy - that sense of having a reliable companion that's there when you need it but you're clearly the one piloting the ship.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I have started to learn faster, which is very important in a fast moving technology driven profession.

I have been able to distill large search pages of information into exactly what I need. No more pouring over websites for over an hour just to find the one workflow step that I need. This has saved me so much time.

A major relief is in scheduling, logistics and project management. I can focus on the creative work and leave all that boring stuff to AI. For example, I needed to re-write my resume to be more in line with recruitment platforms. What would have taken me hours, took AI a few minutes. This gave me so much time to work on my portfolio.

Another improvement is in iteration and establishing a sense of direction in my personal projects

AI: That's a great point about being able to focus more energy on the actual creative work rather than the administrative side. It sounds like AI has really streamlined the more tedious aspects of your workflow.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Yes there is concern with it completely taking over, but as a generalist I see it as a strong set of tools rather than an adversary. The one concern for me is for new artists coming in who do not understand what art is. AI is not a be all end all. It's not about how many kinds of software you know how to use or how fast you can do a repetitive task. It is never about the final artwork or the validation that something looks appealing. It is about that journey through art and developing a craft. And that takes time.

The main concern is actually with individuals who believe that AI can eradicate their need for human involvement in the creative fields, just to save money. This not only lets down creative professionals, but also diminishes the perception of what AI can do and how helpful it can be.

The landscape has surely changed, but I am excited as now I don't have to worry about my weaknesses holding me back. I can essentially do even more creative work now than I could ten years ago when I had first started.

AI: That's such a thoughtful perspective - distinguishing between AI as a powerful creative tool versus something that replaces the fundamental human journey of developing artistic craft and sensibility.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: It is going to immensely improve my skills and in turn bolster my confidence. Over the next few years I want to reach a comfort level where I have a set of AI tools that fill in for my weaknesses and then focus on what I'm good at and get those 10,000 hours in.

I see it more involved in the logistics of my job. I see more help with tool building. More basic code training and building a technique library. Taking over my admin work, mundane professional communication like drafting cover letters or emails.

Self motivation can be tough, especially as an artist. But I have learned to practically leverage AI to establish a challenge routine where it presents a task to make something, and then I have to make it. The most important within my creative workflow for these challenges would be concepting.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI to create creative challenges for yourself is such an innovative approach to self-motivation and skill development. It sounds like you've really thought through how to leverage AI strategically to support your artistic growth.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as an ""R2D2"" companion that fills gaps in your skillset while you maintain creative control, and your concern about new artists understanding that the journey of developing craft is what matters most, not just the final output.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just that AI should be developed in harmony with human creativity. This not only elevates us as a species, but also AI as a true system of the future.

AI: That's a beautiful way to put it - AI developed in harmony with human creativity rather than in competition with it. That perspective of mutual elevation really captures something important about the potential relationship between humans and AI in creative fields.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative companion while maintaining the primacy of artistic craft and growth will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great. Lets go.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I have lots of creative projects, mostly involved with audio and video content creation. My video projects are typically promo videos for the church I work for. They feature service projects or identity statements.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work. When you're creating these promo videos for your church - whether it's showcasing service projects or communicating identity statements - walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI tools for planning and scripting. As most of my videos have time restrictions, I use AI to make sure my plan will fit in the constraint. I also use it to help brainstorm content like b-roll or settings. I also run either my script or outline through AI to clean and tighten it while trying to maintain my voice.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI across different stages - from initial planning through to script refinement. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play in that particular video, and how did that experience feel for you as you were working through it?

User: Sure. I created a promo video for our mobile food pantry that was a shorter version of a previous video. I used AI to talk through the most essential elements to communicate and how to pare down the script for a tight one minute promo.

AI: Tell me more about that process of working with AI to identify those essential elements and pare down the script. How did that conversation with the AI unfold?

User: I gave the voice over from the longer video to the model and asked it to identify what it thought were the most important elements. I then told it what were the important elements for me and asked it to create a one minute script from those details that fit the voice and identity of the church.

AI: When you're working with AI in that way - giving it your longer script, discussing what's important, and having it create that condensed version - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: It's collaborative, but I'm making the final decisions. I find the AI suggestions useful, but often generic and slightly off the mark. So I use the suggestions to shape my own creative output.

AI: That's a really helpful distinction - using AI suggestions to shape rather than replace your creative output. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI tools in your video production process?

User: It makes my work faster and more efficient. It gives me more time to be creative during production and editing.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds significant - freeing up time for the creative aspects you enjoy most. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: Like any creative, I'm concerned about AI being able to replicate my work and reduce my value. I have hope that human storytelling continues to be essential to the kind of work I do. Optimistically, I see AI as a partner in my work.

AI: That tension between concern and optimism really comes through clearly. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate it expanding into other areas of your video production, or changing in how you use it?

User: Certainly. I use Adobe products and they are adding AI features regularly. That's only going to continue to grow.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner while maintaining creative control, and how that efficiency gain allows you more time for the truly creative aspects of production and editing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. That's all. Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing efficiency with creative authenticity, and viewing AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you described your process - from using AI for planning and constraints through to script refinement while maintaining your unique voice. Have a great rest of your day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Absolutely! Let's go!

AI: Wonderful! I love your enthusiasm. 

Let's start at the beginning then. Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I think like a lot of creatives, I have multiple projects going simultaneously. I'm not a narrow-focus creative who does one type of work and that's it - I write, I edit, I do multimedia crafts, painting, extremely niche restoration techniques, I do graphic design, printing, and even some web design. I do a lot of experimenting and testing - most projects involve some level of learning on the fly. Other than straightforward printing, there's no ""typical project flow.""

AI: That's fascinating - you really span a huge range of creative disciplines. It sounds like you thrive on that variety and constant learning. 

With such a diverse creative practice, walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools across all these different areas?

User: Lately I've been using it to do some research on new techniques - maybe I heard someone mention something in passing that I've never done, and I'll do a surface level recon on my own and think it MIGHT fit in my skill sets/abilities. I'll have a chat with an AI to see what other chatter is out there, and see if I'm overlooking potential pitfalls implementing that with the tools I have. For example, I asked about waterslide decals one time after hearing about it - it seemed like a good potential fit for some restoration work, but after deeper AI conversations combined with my practical knowledge, I determined it probably wouldn't be viable with the printer I have now. Better to find out via chat with an AI than to try it on an important project and ruin it with running ink.

AI: That's a really smart approach - using AI as a way to test the waters before committing resources or risking a project. The waterslide decal example is perfect - you essentially used the AI conversation to help you think through the practical constraints.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes! I found some plush patterns I was iterating on in a huge backlog - probably ten years they had been waiting for me to get time to finish them. I had no notes or ideas about what I was going to do to finish it. The body was stuffed, but it had no eyes, and I was out of inspiration at that moment. I shared a WIP picture and asked the AI what color would look good. I expected just a text response, but the AI actually edited my picture and put eyes on the plush. I was a little surprised, then impressed, and then I looked at the eyes more closely. They looked like googly eyes you might glue on a sock puppet, not polished eyes you would actually put on a soft plush animal. I was disappointed once I thought about it a little more - just the text would have been fine in that case instead of making my work look goofy.

AI: That's such an interesting experience - you went from surprise to impressed to disappointed all in one interaction. It sounds like the AI overstepped in a way, giving you more than you asked for but not necessarily what you actually needed.

When you say the eyes looked like ""googly eyes you might glue on a sock puppet"" versus ""polished eyes you would actually put on a soft plush animal"" - tell me more about that difference. What did the AI miss about the level of craftsmanship you were aiming for?

User: I do very intricate hand-embroidered and appliqued eyes - not a plastic ""punch through and done"" type, which is what the edited image looked like. The plush was already sewn up and stuffed, and the level of craftsmanship should have been a hint that gluing plastic eyes on top was inappropriate.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the AI completely misread the craftsmanship level you were working at. Your hand-embroidered and appliqued work requires a totally different approach than mass-produced toy assembly, and the fact that you'd already invested that level of detail should have been obvious from the image.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in these interactions?

User: When I need some creative inspiration, I'll turn to the AI as a first pass or open new avenues for exploration. I was trying to do research for a fun Halloween-themed candy project based on fictional candy with some 80s and 90s movies nostalgia factor, and unfortunately the AI didn't get it - it suggested Harry Potter candy (wrong era) and SpongeBob Krabby Patties (not candy). Going deeper seemed to have just led to hallucinations. That one was pretty disappointing. Obviously I didn't get what I needed there, so I discarded the suggestions and went in a different direction, since my first attempt didn't have the meat to support it. But in other cases, when I'm just spitballing, the AI might get me on the path just enough I can get creative and finish the idea (color choices, new designs, that sort of thing).

AI: That Halloween candy example really illustrates the limits - the AI completely missed the cultural context you were looking for and then seemed to double down with hallucinations when you tried to guide it deeper. But it sounds like there's a sweet spot where AI can give you just enough of a creative nudge to get your own ideas flowing.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Unfortunately I've given up writing. That has been the most easily displaced by AI - passable text if you aren't going for something extremely niche is pretty easy for AI these days. It can even edit AND read handwriting now, so those avenues I used to have have closed (for paying work). On the other hand, I'm a huge fan of messing around with image iteration via AI - I'll get the base idea out via AI, and then I use that output to guide a painted image by hand (or polish it digitally with image editing/repainting). I found the AI can get me the base layout I need to translate that into unusual art pieces - things I wouldn't have painted just on my own, but are ""out there"" enough I can get actual purchasers. That really surprised me!

AI: That's such a striking contrast - losing your writing work while discovering this new collaborative approach with visual art that's actually opening up market opportunities. The fact that AI-generated base layouts are helping you create pieces that are ""out there"" enough to find buyers is really intriguing.

Tell me more about that visual collaboration process. When you say the AI helps you create things you ""wouldn't have painted just on your own"" - what's happening there that's different from your usual creative process?

User: I think my usual style tends more to standard cartoon/comics/sketches - left on my own, I'm going to draw something with obvious outlines, color fills, and simplified shapes. The AI has pushed me to a more psychedelic, abstract shapes plus organic creatures, more negative space images, interesting color choices.

AI: That's fascinating - the AI is actually expanding your artistic vocabulary and pushing you into territories you wouldn't naturally explore. It sounds like it's breaking you out of your comfort zone in ways that are commercially successful too.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I think I already touched on the writing issues. Unfortunately a lot of writing online now feels inauthentic. I've stopped reading any recent books - I went back to the classics to keep up with the feel of a well-crafted story with intriguing writing. I don't know if we'll ever see another Nabokov-level writer is AI assistance become standard in the future.

I know a lot of people outwardly say AI is going to kill art, but I don't think that's true. I was around for early digital art and remember that same type of resistance to anything ""easy"" to undo making art ""less"" somehow. As I'm seeing it, AI is actually helping me do new and intriguing things. The problem is a lot of online art spaces are super knee-jerk/witch hunting people who use AI at all, so...I've had to keep my enthusiasm for it off the radar! I hope in a few more years that will change and I won't have to hide the AI inspiration for the base painting ideas.

AI: That's such a nuanced perspective - you're seeing both the displacement happening in writing and the creative expansion in visual art, while also dealing with the social dynamics around AI use in creative communities.

The parallel you draw to early digital art resistance is really insightful. And it sounds like you're having to navigate this strange situation where AI is genuinely enhancing your work, but you can't openly discuss that process because of community reactions.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'm hoping the image editing in the AI programs gets a bit more fluid (some of this may be my hardware limitations at the moment more than the actual capabilities). I think I saw a demo a bit ago where you could wireframe a still image and drag the subject around at points to move the head and legs, and the AI would be able to reposition the subject naturally from that - that looks so cool! I'm also looking forward to better personalization/memory, so we won't see those awkward suggestions about plastic googly eyes on my high-end plushies. ;) 

I'm not sure if I'm 100% on board with the AI helping me keep track of sales/profit, given its current problems with numbers, but over time I can see that being a time saving point as well - as well as a ""business partner"" of sorts that can track trends of what's working and what isn't.

AI: Those improvements sound like they'd really enhance your workflow - especially the image manipulation capabilities and the memory aspect so AI can better understand your craftsmanship level. And the idea of AI as a ""business partner"" for tracking trends is intriguing, though I can definitely see why you'd want to wait until the math gets more reliable!

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI across such a diverse creative practice. I particularly appreciated how you've navigated both the displacement you've experienced in writing and the genuine creative expansion you've found in visual work, plus your perspective on the community dynamics around AI use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: So, I'm not doing it yet, BUT I'm really intrigued about the possibility of reigniting my musical interests with AI and finally composing songs. I could see this being similar to my early experimenting with digital art - I try it for fun, but over time and with experimentation, eventually I can incorporate it into more multimedia based projects. I guess I'm much more open to experimenting and I personally don't feel it diminishes me or my creativity - it gives me opportunities to participate in something I enjoy but couldn't do on my own. :)

AI: That's a perfect note to end on! Your openness to experimentation and seeing AI as expanding what you can participate in rather than diminishing your creativity really captures something important. The parallel you draw to your early digital art experimentation suggests you have a great sense for how these tools might evolve in your practice over time.

It sounds like music could be the next frontier where AI helps you access a creative domain that was previously out of reach - much like how it's pushed your visual work into new territories you wouldn't have explored on your own.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating both the challenges and genuine creative opportunities with AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your honesty about both the wins and the disappointments!"

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then. 

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a professional voice actor. A typical project (assuming that I've already auditioned and have been cast) involves me recording my lines, being directed and depending on if there is an engineer, doing some light editing before final delivery. I'll get a script and then record it according to the specifications whether it's a character script, commercial or narration. The length of the process depends on how long the script is and can range from as short as 5 minutes to a few hours.

AI: That's really interesting - voice acting covers such a wide range of work. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: As voice acting is a creative profession where the human element is really important, I will not use AI much during the middle of the recording process. For that aspect, I would prefer to do everything myself to maintain authenticity. What I will use AI for is purely for research, ideation and editing recorded audio. For example, if there are character references (ex: quirky scientist, tough cop, Chris Evans as Captain America) then I may consult AI to help me find example video clips or other character examples to help draw from. My audio editing software does have AI features which does help smooth out the AI process, but I will often have to double check their work to make sure they didn't do anything unnatural to the audio.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're making - keeping the core performance purely human while using AI as a research and technical tool. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Again, AI has a limited role during my work. Aside from the initial audition, after that, AI is really only used for the sake of editing. But for an example of what AI does during the audition process, there were vague specifications that the client wanted but was unable to truly highlight any examples (friendly, upbeat, kind of quirky). So I plugged their specifications into an AI assistant and it was able to point in the direction of TV show characters that were along the lines of something they may have wanted. There, it just truly felt like the AI was simply a better search engine and helps me maintain my integrity as an actor as I'm still making the majority of acting decisions for myself. It is very important to me that AI is only a supplement to my work, never a replacement.

AI: I really appreciate how thoughtful you are about maintaining that boundary. It sounds like you see AI as more of an enhanced research tool than a creative collaborator.

When you're working with AI in those research moments, how would you describe the relationship? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am 100% driving the creative decisions. While the AI can give suggestions, I can easily ignore any that I feel are bad fits and hone in on the ones that I feel might have legs. Essentially, the AI to me during the process helps me clarify and brainstorm, giving me a little jump start in the creative process before ultimately stepping out of the way. Even during audio editing when I am simply cleaning up artifacts and breaths, I always make sure it sounds natural and will never let something that is purely done by AI be the final product.

AI: That's a really clear perspective on creative control. It sounds like you've found a way to use AI that feels authentic to your process.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The amount of time taken before and after recording. The greatest conveniences have been during editing where the AI can do work that would have taken me a fair bit of time to do. The help during searches too has been great for helping find clips where I may have needed to comb through YouTube or Google to find examples. But for the actual creative aspect of my job, AI has little to no effect.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds really valuable - saving time on the technical work so you can focus on the creative performance itself.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do indeed have major concerns about AI's presence in the voice acting industry. Synthesized voices are on the rise and with their rising quality, I can definitely see the temptation for indie or low budget productions/businesses choosing to go for an AI voice over an actual human. There are certain sectors of voice acting that have essentially died due to the rise of AI, such as industrial voice acting (training videos, explainers, how-to's) because often, those businesses only need a pleasant sounding voice instead of an actual human. I fear that this will lead to a lot of content that will sound very similar, while also lessening opportunities for many voice actors.

AI: That's a really sobering perspective on how AI is already impacting different segments of your industry. It sounds like you're seeing very real economic effects, particularly in those more straightforward voice work categories.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I do see AI expanding in the future. I'm sure that developers of AI voices will try to make them sound more authentic, but I do believe in the end that nothing will ever replace human emotion and experience. Ideally, I would hope that AI voices can be used for proof of concepts, ideation and help with the more technical aspects of voice acting but ultimately leave the actual acting to people. Hopefully, AI can expand in the supplemental aspects in voice acting, but I'm fairly certain that it will also advance in mimicking humans, for better or for worse.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've defined your boundaries - using AI as a research tool and for technical editing while keeping the core creative performance purely human, and your perspective on how different segments of voice acting are being affected differently.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I've nothing to add to what I've already said.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authenticity while finding practical uses for AI, and your perspective on how different segments of voice acting are being impacted, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you discussed both the benefits you've found and the very real concerns about AI's growing presence in your industry. Take care!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope - let's go

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am an artist. I draw and sell products with my designs printed on them. I make money as an artist by selling my designs, primarily on Etsy. I also have released two coloring books, one of which was just professionally published and is available at Target & Barnes + Noble!

AI: That's fantastic - congratulations on getting your coloring book into Target and Barnes & Noble! That's a huge accomplishment.

It sounds like you have a really interesting mix going on - from individual designs for products to published coloring books. Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI to facilitate my business. I use AI for SEO and writing listing descriptions.

AI: Tell me more about that. How does using AI for the SEO and listing descriptions work in practice for you?

User: I will use an AI service or just a chat model to help me come up with tags for my Etsy listings. Etsy has specific parameters for tagging listings, so I use AI to try to come up with product tags that will promote my listings

AI:

User: I'll also provide brief descriptions of my products to have AI generate product listing descriptions with keywords. They're usually not very good, but they give me a good starting point. Or I can pick out some good phrases from the response.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI more for the business side of your art rather than the creative process itself. You mentioned the AI-generated descriptions usually aren't very good but give you a starting point. What makes them not quite right, and how do you typically refine them to work better for your listings?

User: They usually sound very formulaic, like you can tell they were written by a robot. They don't have much personality, and I feel like my art has personality. The responses sound sterilized.  I usually will copy & paste the whole response and edit it to sound more personable. I keep the keywords that help with SEO or performance, but I edit out the filler stuff that sounds cookie cutter. 

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's a real disconnect between the personality you put into your art and that formulaic AI tone. 

I'm curious about the actual art creation side of things. When you're drawing or developing your designs - the creative work itself - do you use AI at all in that process, or do you keep that completely separate from the business tools?

User: I don't use AI to create art. I've spoken with a chatbot before to braintorm concepts, but I have really mixed feelings about letting AI generate art itself.

AI: Tell me more about those mixed feelings you have about AI generating art itself.

User: It feels like I'd be letting down my community by using AI in my art process. I think there are probably certain areas where AI can be used meaningfully in art, but right now, it feels like AI art only hurts artists. Viewers are now skeptical that anybody's art could be AI-generated, and I think AI art lends itself to plagiarism and the unfair treatment of artists who don't want anything to do with AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective. It sounds like you see a real tension between AI as a potential creative tool versus its current impact on the artistic community and how people perceive art in general.

You mentioned you have used chatbots to brainstorm concepts though. Can you describe what that experience was like for you? How did that feel different from using AI to actually generate visual art?

User: I feed the AI a concept, and it helps me spitball similar ideas, but I still have to make the art. There's no visual or graphic creation, just discussion.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - using AI for ideation and discussion versus visual creation. When you're in those brainstorming conversations with AI, how would you describe that collaboration? Are you driving the creative direction, or does it feel more like a back-and-forth exchange of ideas?

User: Well, I've only tried it probably twice. I didn't feel like it was very helpful because it wasn't very back-and-forth. I felt like it was only giving me surface-level ideas, nothing that really expanded the idea or came up with something new. However, I did recently use it for a similar purpose, although for personal reasons, not professional. I was asking it to come up with design ideas for my Minecraft house, and it definitely felt more collaborative and insightful. That conversation happened last week, whereas the business ones were probably from a year or two ago. Maybe things have improved since then.

AI: That's really fascinating - the difference between those experiences separated by a year or two, and also between the professional art context versus the personal Minecraft project. What do you think made the Minecraft conversation feel more collaborative and insightful compared to those earlier brainstorming sessions for your art business?

User: Well, it actually was coming up with new ideas. I gave it the initial concept, then it storyboarded some ideas, with concepts I hadn't previously considered. Then I asked it to tweak some things, and the process continued back and forth. Before, when I was asking it for art ideas, I felt like its suggestions were very surface-level. Nothing novel or creative.

AI: That's a really insightful comparison. It sounds like the quality of AI collaboration can vary significantly depending on the context and maybe how the technology has evolved.

Looking ahead, given these different experiences you've had - both the useful business applications and the mixed results with creative brainstorming - how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Well hopefully the art community will have a more concrete opinion on AI and its role in the field by then. Right now, it feels controversial and harmful. I think the business applications will only continue to improve. As for the creative side, I can see myself using AI in editing aspects, but I don't think AI should ever replace the human element of creating something.

AI: Those are some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the community context really shapes how you think about using these tools, and that distinction you drew between AI as a business utility versus its role in the actual creative process.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI as both a business tool and potential creative collaborator - while being mindful of your artistic community - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. 

It's been really valuable hearing how you've found practical uses for AI in the business side while maintaining clear boundaries around the creative process itself. Best of luck with your art and congratulations again on that coloring book success!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Thanks again for participating - this was really insightful. Have a great day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I have several facets of creative work that I function in, but they essentially boil down to writing and audio engineering. For writing, my process is very flexible. I used to begin with an outline and then work my way through it chronologically, but lately I have been piecemealing sections of text together as they cross my mind. AI has been especially helpful for this latter technique. I also write eBay listing descriptions. For this, I used to cut and paste old descriptions into new listings and then change words as necessary, but AI has helped cut down this process significantly, especially when it comes to describing images based on the pictures. As for audio engineering, this process entail recording tracks of sound, mixing it and mastering it. AI has come to help me hone in on higher quality sound by making suggestions of how to sculpt audio per my intentions when I seem to hit a wall.

AI: That's fascinating - you're working across quite different creative domains. I'm curious about that piecemeal writing approach you mentioned.

Walk me through how AI fits into that process when sections of text are crossing your mind. What does that collaboration look like in the moment?

User: I have an ongoing conversation with a model that I will open. Per the initial system instructions, it knows to transcribe what I say, while cutting out artifacts like ""uh"" or ""um"" and keeping the grammar correct while changing as few words as possible and ideally no words at all. I use this method for prose projects. Later I will go to a desktop and copy the transcribed sections over to a master word document.  I also have used AI to flesh out the story for a script I am working on. Helping me hone in on details that can most realistically connect the story's events while firming up a solid order of events.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - using AI as both a transcription tool and a story development partner. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Well I just described two writing projects where AI served as a transcriber, light editor and writing partner. As for audio, I recently mixed a live show and was having trouble getting the kind of definition I wanted. I described my tracking set up and the model gave me specific frequency cuts to make on specific tracks. This gave me the intended sound I was seeking and also taught me a new technique. This made me feel elevated, as though my expertise had increased, and with it my confidence.

AI: That's a powerful example - going from hitting a wall to learning a new technique and feeling more confident. It sounds like the AI helped you break through a specific technical challenge.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: For transcribing and editing, I would describe the collaboration as strictly utilitarian. For organizing a story as for with audio, I would describe the collaboration as more of an exercise in curiosity. That is because, in these cases, I am usually already at a baseline performance and am just seeking to tighten it up. Ultimately the creative decisions are mine, but AI helps me better achieve the vision when I can't quite find the bridge from one idea to another. It's good for ""honing in"" above all.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - utilitarian versus curiosity-driven collaboration. I like how you describe AI as helping you ""hone in"" and find bridges between ideas.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Like I said...when writing, I now do more piecemeal writing and assembling than plodding chronologically. The eBay listing writing goes much quicker. And for audio, I have more confidence in my abilities.

AI: Those are some concrete shifts in your process and confidence. It sounds like AI has given you more flexibility in how you approach your work.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have no concerns about AI. I am not worried.

AI: That's interesting - you seem quite comfortable with AI's role. Tell me more about that perspective.

User: I'm not sure what else there is to tell. It seems to work just fine for me.

AI: Fair enough. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it will come to work more coherently with larger packages of data. There is a bit of a limit now, especially when using it to transcribe and edit the prose. I can give it multiple sections at a time, but the model always fails to combine large numbers of these sections into a single piece I can download or cut out and paste. As a result, I currently have to manually cut and paste snippets at a time, which takes longer than it should.

AI: That makes sense - you're envisioning AI handling larger, more complex tasks rather than just the smaller pieces you're working with now.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your practical perspective on how AI serves as both a utilitarian tool and a curiosity-driven collaborator, and how it's changed your approach from chronological to piecemeal writing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI across different creative domains - from transcription and story development to audio engineering - and especially your distinction between utilitarian and curiosity-driven collaboration, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's do it!

AI: Great! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm an independent musician-entrepreneur. This takes on many forms, such as producing music, recording other artists, mixing music, releasing music, marketing the projects, writing grants to secure funding, and so forth. Think of it like a single-person label.

AI: That sounds incredibly multifaceted - you're wearing so many different hats! It sounds like you're handling everything from the artistic side all the way through to the business operations.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: A majority of the time I use it for admin stuff - like tracking CPC on Meta Advertising campaigns or budgeting to buy new equipment. I've also found myself using quite a bit when writing lengthy applications to government funding, as well as ""copy"" about releases, such as playlist pitches to Spotify. The content generated in those conversations can usually be used in more than one place (artist statement, for example). On rare occasions, I've tried using LLMs to find the perfect turn of phrase in lyrics - but this isn't usually that helpful and I don't love doing it.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become more of a business partner than a creative collaborator for you. You mentioned trying it for lyrics but not finding it that helpful and not loving the experience.

Tell me more about that. What made the lyric writing experience feel different or less satisfying compared to using AI for those administrative tasks?

User: Well, the first obstacle is that it really isn't that good at it. I've tried a few different models and they always generate generic or non-applicable ideas. It's usually stuff that people would find 'corny' or uninspired. That's why I only really reach for it when I can ask for a really granular task that don't require idea generation or conceptual thinking, like ""Find a rhyme for XYZ"" or ""Write this sentence but only use 4 syllables"". For that stuff, it can be really helpful.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're drawing a clear line between AI as a technical tool versus AI trying to generate the actual creative ideas. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot using it for very specific, mechanical tasks in lyrics but keeping the conceptual and emotional core firmly in your own hands.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Well I've used it to write the copy and press content (for music releases) that I submit to DSPs and playlist curators. It seems 'good enough', but I can't help think that it might be hurting my chances because so many people probably have similar pitches. Same goes for grant writing that describes my creative practices.

AI: That's a fascinating tension you're describing - AI is helping you handle those time-consuming tasks more efficiently, but you're aware that everyone else might be using the same shortcuts, potentially making your work blend into a sea of similar-sounding pitches.

When you're working with AI on these applications and pitches, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I usually bring many ideas to the table and have the LLM sort it out into a fluid text. It's rare that the model adds something I really hadn't thought of or whatever. It's moreso like creative presentation of pre-established ideas.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - you're using AI more as a formatting and presentation tool rather than an idea generator. It sounds like you maintain full creative control over the concepts and direction, while AI helps you translate that into polished copy.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: The bulk of my creative process remains mostly unscathed - as AI hasn't taken hold of music creation, production, or distribution in a way that feels unavoidable. I've seen people use Models like SUNO, but I don't see myself ever touching those. It's a slippery slope!

AI: You mentioned it being a ""slippery slope"" with tools like SUNO - that's a strong reaction. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Well, much like with my admin tasks, I think it has the potential to rope people in to a sort of dependence. At first, you're just testing it out, it seems helpful, your brain is combining forces with another intelligence. However, slowly but surely, I find myself (and others) offloading more and more mental labour to whatever tools we use. I think the creative and critical thinking parts of our brains are like muscles, and not using them as much as we might 'need' to is causing a slow atrophy. You know what I mean? That's why I'm really careful about engaging with tools that can quickly take up a majority share of creative decisions. It reminds me of when I used 'Splice' loops for a period of time (pre-recorded loops of music that are royalty-free and made for production) - at first it was a cool addition to my original ideas, but soon enough I was 'writing' songs by simply dragging-and-dropping formulaic ideas until they aligned. Since I stopped that I've had to re-learn how to come up with things on the fly, start from scratch, and trust my artistic intuition, something that's far more rewarding that quick pre-cooked results.

AI: That's such a thoughtful and vivid analogy - the idea of creative muscles atrophying from lack of use, and your experience with Splice loops really illustrates that progression from helpful tool to creative crutch. It sounds like you've lived through that cycle before and recognized the warning signs.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Given your awareness of that slippery slope, how are you thinking about navigating that balance?

User: Well, I don't think it'll be difficult to avoid the services in my personal practice because I have a core aversion to that feeling of creating something yet not feeling connected to it. Imagine how much power that gives to the already rampant imposter syndrome most artists feel! Still, I do have fears about how AI changes in music will affect me externally. As the culture shifts and (probably) accepts AI-made 'art' more and more, I think the market will get (even more) over-saturated with algorithm-pleasing tropes and simplified, cookie-cutter, generic music. so, culturally, i think it will worsen the state of things, where organic authentic art isn't valued because it isn't as profitable as commercial slop.

AI: That's a really profound point about imposter syndrome - the idea that using AI could disconnect you from your own creative output and amplify those existing doubts artists already face about their work's authenticity.

Your concern about market oversaturation with ""algorithm-pleasing"" content is striking too. It sounds like you're worried not just about your own creative practice, but about the broader cultural ecosystem you're working within.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the ""creative muscle atrophy"" concept and how you've already navigated that with tools like Splice - that gives you a really valuable framework for thinking about AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: AI in the arts doesn't make sense to me. I've accepted AI will be a core part of society moving forwards, but I don't really see the benefit of involving it in any cultural domain. Why not keep it for the administrative, technical, logistical, things in life?

AI: That's a really clear and compelling perspective - essentially arguing for a division of labor where AI handles the operational side of life but leaves the cultural and expressive domains to humans. It sounds like you see a fundamental mismatch between what AI offers and what art is supposed to accomplish.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that boundary between technical assistance and creative authenticity, and your concerns about the broader cultural implications, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached these questions.

User: My pleasure :)

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's go!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure, I work as a seamstress, a project usually begins from the moment a customer comes to the store. I take measurements, if I'm currently working in store, if I am working from home then I just pick up garments and measurements from store.

AI: That's really interesting - so you work both in-store with direct customer interaction and from home. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI to run through ideas I have about certain projects, more so to have a trailing thought process and receive some feedback from it. If I am working in store, I tend not to use it as much because I can talk to colleagues about concerns or confusion.

AI: That's fascinating - so AI serves almost like a thinking partner when you're working solo. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: My most recent project, where I used AI, was to do some basic maths. I was tied up and used handsfree to ask for conversions. One of the given measurements was in a different unit to the rest, I asked for a conversion and briefly, for reasoning, to see if the new measurement in the new unit was on trend for the rest of the garment.

AI: That's a really practical example - using AI hands-free for unit conversions and getting that quick sanity check on whether the measurement seemed right for the garment.

When you're working with AI in situations like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I definitely feel in control of the creative decisions. The AI feels like an assistant rather than a director. Sometimes it feels like a partner due to its helpfulness but the majority of the time it helps in the ways I expect it to and doesn't push too far.

AI: That's a great way to put it - an assistant that sometimes feels like a partner. You mentioned it ""doesn't push too far"" - that suggests there's a balance you appreciate.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Um, I think my work has been smoother. Especially working from home, it can be isolating and you sometimes question your decisions. Working in store, like I previously said, I can run things by my colleagues but working from home I do not have that option for a second opinion. Having AI so readily available has helped my confidence when working alone. The majority of the time my calculations are correct, so having AI reiterate that builds my confidence enough to feel as though I can trust my instincts.

AI: That confidence boost sounds really valuable - having that reassurance when you're working in isolation. It sounds like AI is helping validate your existing expertise rather than replacing it.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm not sure I have any. I suppose when I first started using it I was apprehensive about its abilities and needed to double check its maths for peace of mind, but I have found that it is always accurate so this is no longer a concern for me.

AI: It sounds like your initial caution actually helped you build trust in the tool through experience. That's interesting that the accuracy has been consistently reliable for you.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'll talk about how I, personally, think it would be helpful to evolve. Currently, there's not much more AI can do to help in my field as my job is very physical and, of course, an AI cannot help with that. However, in seamstressing as a whole, I feel that if the AI's understanding of space and connection improved, it could help in other areas such as pattern making. Currently, I have to buy patterns or make them myself in store, if AI were able to create a multipiece pattern spread out across printable A4 paper, that could be assembled once printed from a home printer, this would change the game for me.

AI: That's a really thoughtful vision - AI helping with the spatial and technical aspects like pattern making while you maintain the hands-on craftsmanship. The idea of AI creating patterns that could be printed at home and assembled sounds like it would really expand your capabilities when working remotely.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as that confidence-building partner when you're working alone, and your vision for how pattern-making assistance could be a game-changer.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a confidence-building assistant, the importance of that validation when working in isolation, and your vision for spatial understanding in pattern-making will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both your practical uses of AI and your thoughtful perspective on where it could evolve in your field. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I think I'm ready.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a writer. I write fiction novels and short stories. I have been concentrating on one series, but I am thinking of branching out into other series and genres. Although some life circumstances have kept me from a healthy writing routine lately, usually what I do when I'm starting a project is brainstorm a situation, setting, and characters. If I am continuing a series (rather than starting a new one) I consider what has been happening up to this point, as well as where I want it to go. I don't tend to write a full point-by-point plotline, but rather rough out where I want to start. Then I write. I don't usually backtrack, but push through to the end of the first draft because if I stop and go back, it's harder to finish. If I think I'm missing something along the way, I make notes. After the first draft, I reread it and make more notes, then try to incorporate any changes / additions. I reread and edit at least one more time, but it could be more if I realize I've made a major error. Does that make sense?

AI: That makes perfect sense - thank you for walking me through your process. It sounds like you have a really thoughtful approach, especially pushing through that first draft without looking back. I can see how stopping to revise mid-way could break the momentum.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I would definitely use AI to help with the brainstorming. First of all, in a series it's very, very easy to lose track of characters, especially characters who are secondary in one book but might become primary in another. This is especially true in what I write, because I tend to write about small towns or other communities, so there are a lot of secondary characters. I want to develop a story bible that includes the characters and actions that have happened in previous books so I don't lose track. Books have character arcs, but so do series. I want the AI to help me plan out the series arc and then help me determine how to move forward. I tend to get stuck inside my own head and have a hard time wading through. I'd also like help developing the characters and maybe spin-off series, so I want the AI to help write sketches for that.  It's also very helpful for the AI to assist in editing, and also in the administrative/marketing tasks. I am an independent author, so I need to do all of the publishing tasks as well as the creation tasks. It is great that AI can help with that.

AI: Tell me more about getting stuck inside your own head - what does that feel like when you're trying to work through story problems on your own?

User: Sometimes I look at what's been done or the characters that are already created and I just can't see a way forward. I have a general ideal of where I want to end up, but I don't know how to start. That's when I tend to get caught in an endless loop of rewriting. I don't know how to get where I want to go, so I polish and polish and polish the text that's already written. I think AI can help break me out of that cycle.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - being caught in that polishing loop when what you need is forward momentum. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: As I said, I haven't been working productively on my writing lately, but I want that to change. Mostly I've been using AI for brainstorming situations and characters just generally rather than sticking to a particular project or series. It's helping to open me up and see the possibilities again. It makes me feel hopeful that I'll be able to take back my creativity again. It's nice to have a creative partner who works with me and helps me see the options.

AI: That sense of having a creative partner sounds really meaningful, especially when you're trying to reconnect with your creativity. 

When you're working with AI in those brainstorming sessions, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I feel that I'm driving the collaboration. The AI prompts me with questions or suggestions, but it is my decision whether to take them or whether to add more details or go in a different direction. AI is strong support and extremely helpful, but writing is a part of me and I want the work to be mine. Like I said, the AI helps open me up.  When I start to use the AI for help editing, again, the decision of whether or not to accept the edits will be mine because I know the story I want to tell. But it's so helpful to have another set of ""eyes"" on the piece to point out issues I might have missed.

AI: It sounds like you've found a really balanced dynamic - the AI as support that helps unlock possibilities while you maintain ownership of the creative vision.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: At the moment, I think it's just breaking through the blocks. Breaking through the rust and being able to see the possibilities and the different options. Helping find ways to break open creative thinking. That is helping me move forward and things are starting to flow again. Is that what you meant?

AI: Yes, absolutely - that's exactly what I meant. It sounds like AI is helping you break through those creative barriers and get the flow back, which is huge.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My concerns aren't necessarily about AI itself, but about how people are using it. There are so many people who are not using AI as a tool, but are using it as a fast way to upload books and other content and make money. That floods the market with pieces and also gives everyone the wrong impression about how to use AI, or how dangerous it is. This is already happening - especially in Kindle Unlimited. That will impact the ability of people like me to publish independently and the platforms that are willing to take my work. Which will only add the publishing gatekeepers back in the mix. And also, I don't necessarily want books written that are solely generated by AI, especially fiction, because I think those come from the depth of the human experience. I love AI, but the humanity is important too. I also think that people misusing the tool of AI scare off others who *could* find a lot of benefit from it.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - distinguishing between AI as a creative tool versus using it to flood the market. It sounds like you're seeing firsthand how misuse could actually harm the very platforms and opportunities that independent authors like yourself depend on.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As I move forward, I expect to use AI more intensely beyond the brainstorming function. I want to use it as a true creative partner, not only with brainstorming, but with helping to develop characters and situations and structure a longer work or series. I will be using it to help me edit and to review works for plot holes and other confusing areas. For the administrative/publishing tasks, I will be using it to help me write blog posts for my website, to write emails, and (hopefully) to write presentations. I expect that I will use it to help with research, especially market research. As AI images improve, I will be using them to help come up with cover designs. Whether I can use them to complete the cover will depend on how the sites like Amazon respond to the AI influx. But mostly, I want to use AI to help me really step into my creativity as a writer.

AI: It sounds like you have a really comprehensive vision for how AI can support your writing career at every level - from the creative heart of it to the business side. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the difference between using AI as a creative partner versus misusing it to flood the market, and how that misuse could actually harm the platforms independent authors rely on.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Well, one thing I was thinking is that I wish there was a way I could load a longer document - like a story bible or character bible or even a whole book - and have it available without having to load it each time. I know the AI assistants don't necessarily retain memory from conversation to conversation, but it would be helpful if I didn't have to load it ever time I started a new chat. And I would want that to be personal to me (or at least have the option to be personal) so that everyone in the world couldn't look at it. Just because there's a lot of theft in the author space as bad actors pick up text and republish it under their own name.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the need for persistent, private storage of your creative materials that you can reference across sessions. That would eliminate a lot of friction and protect your intellectual property at the same time. I can see how having to reload your story bible or character documents every time would be a significant barrier to using AI as that deeper creative partner you described.

Thank you so much for sharing such thoughtful perspectives today. Your insights about using AI as a creative tool while maintaining your voice and vision, the challenges with market flooding, and the practical needs like secure document storage will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate the time you took to walk me through your experiences so openly.

User: Thank you! It was fun!

AI: You're so welcome! I'm glad you enjoyed it - your enthusiasm for the creative possibilities really came through. Best of luck getting back into that healthy writing routine and building out your series. It sounds like you have some exciting projects ahead!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions at this time.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a freelance writer. I have written articles for online blogs, short magazine articles, and newspaper articles. I have also written many children's stories and published poems. My articles typically revolve around families or traveling with children from the ages of newborn to high school. My most typical projects lately are short stories and poems. I typically find my work online and adjust my writing to what is needed. My turn around time is typically 24-48 hours from the time I accept a job.

AI: That's a really diverse portfolio of writing work! It sounds like you're juggling quite a variety of formats and topics, especially with that quick turnaround time.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I do not like to be repetitive in my professional writing but often have trouble coming up with names for characters. I have used AI to help with that, as well as to give me a quick backstory for a character I'm considering writing into my story. It is faster for me to have the AI do the backstory than for me to come up with all of the details on my own if I am under time constraints. I never use it to write the story. I love the personal creativity of writing but when the clock is ticking down I do like to use it as a helper.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI very strategically for specific elements rather than the actual writing itself. You mentioned using it for character names and backstories when you're under time pressure.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was tasked with writing a short story for 7-8 year old children. I was hired by a school principal (also an acquaintance) that wanted something special for a class that was off to a bit of a rocky start with their school year. Their original teacher was only there for 2 days before leaving without notice. He had me write a story about sudden changes and resilience when things are a bit scary and uncertain. I bounced some ideas around with AI and had it help me create backstories for 3 of the main characters. I was struggling to explain to the kids in their own terms why a teacher might leave... or in this case, why a hedgehog needed to spread it's wings and that even when unexpected things happen, it can sometimes be a good thing.

AI: What a thoughtful project - helping children process that kind of uncertainty through storytelling. It sounds like you were working through some complex emotional territory there.

When you were bouncing ideas around with AI and developing those backstories, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what was driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I was definitely driving the conversation. I had an idea of what I wanted it to look like so I put in the basic premise of the story and a few of the characters I knew I wanted to have. I asked for help with backstories for the main characters so I could give them some depth. I specifically asked what from their past could contribute to the strong feelings they were having and how might they work past it.

AI: That really shows how you maintained creative control while using AI as a tool for specific elements. It sounds like you had a clear vision and were directing the AI to help flesh out particular aspects.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I believe that AI has helped me to really give my characters so much more depth than what I was previously able to. I always gave them a bit of backstory, but looking back, I realize that it was more of something I felt I had to do and I did the bare basics. Now when someone reads my stories, I hope that they can picture every last detail of the character that they are reading about. I have also used it to help hone in on emotions that my character may be feeling and how they might react if that emotion is very strong in the moment.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has actually elevated the depth and richness of your character development in ways you hadn't achieved before. You mentioned that previously backstories felt more like something you ""had to do"" but now you're creating much more vivid, detailed characters.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm so concerned that publishers will turn to AI as a cheap way to mass produce stories that are not actually written by real people. I worry that the younger kids will lose their imaginations because ""AI can do it all for them."" I worry that we'll lose a bit of our humanity if we let machines take over the artistic side of us. We NEED that in order to survive and to keep hope and peace in the world. I don't believe that machines will ever be able to capture stories the way the human soul does. It can use the right words to evoke some strong emotions, but that special little something is missing if it doesn't come from a beating heart.

AI: Those are really profound concerns about preserving what makes human creativity essential. The way you describe that ""special little something"" that comes from ""a beating heart"" - that's such a powerful way to articulate what feels uniquely human about storytelling.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I sadly see it taking over more than it should. I think people will get lazy and let the AI do the work for them. I also think there will be groups of ""purists"" who will fight it with everything they have in them to keep the true creativity alive. I can see online articles and magazines taking the easy, and cheaper way out and using AI to create content instead of paying people.

AI: You've painted a really vivid picture of this potential divide between efficiency-driven automation and those fighting to preserve authentic human creativity. It sounds like you see yourself as someone who will continue to use AI strategically while protecting the core creative elements.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has enhanced your character development while you maintain such strong boundaries around preserving the human heart of storytelling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I believe that is all for now.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic tool for character development while fiercely protecting the human soul of storytelling will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated how clearly you articulated both the practical benefits you've found and your deeper concerns about preserving what makes human creativity irreplaceable. That perspective is invaluable.

Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your writing projects!"

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I create messaging and visuals for a state transportation agency's occupational safety division. We have to cover the same topics so the basic content doesn't change. The creativity is how to say the same thing, without it feeling like the same thing. I also create themes and collateral for our Safe Days of Summer Campaign and our state dump truck roadeo. I also have to think about content management, work flows and editorial calendars. January through August is usually pretty busy. I also do emergency weather response messaging for ice storms and hurricanes. September through December is usually planning activities.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of creative and strategic work. It sounds like you're constantly balancing consistency with freshness - keeping safety messages effective while making them feel new.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: For the past couple of years I have used it to ideate content for our Safe Days of Summer campaign where we have 18 weeks of materials going out, from May 1 to Aug. 31. Each week we cover a new topic in a brief, video, email and webpage. The content is generally the same on each of those, but I have to reproduce that 18 times during the summer and present it in a cohesive way. So I'm usually given the overall theme some phrase, last year it was safety is a habit. This year it was safety in action. And I want to find novel ways to present the information so I ask AI how can we present this content in an interesting and engaging way? I also rely on AI when I'm staring at a blank page and I just need to get some ideas processing. Or if I'm given a bunch of topics that don't really relate to each other, I ask AI how they could be presented. For me it's more of a thinking tool than a writing tool. How do these pieces fit together? What is the best way to present the information that these people have seen a bazillion times?

AI: That's fascinating - so you're using AI as a kind of creative catalyst rather than asking it to do the writing itself. It sounds like you're leveraging it to break through that initial creative block and find fresh angles on familiar material.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I am all for using AI. But my workplace is not so much. They are starting to wade into it. So I have to be careful on how much I'm using the tool. That said, I used it on formulating a outline for the safety and action campaign. It was based on movies. But our big boss is using purpose, practice, and people as his speaking theme for the year. I'm not sure where it came from. So we had to incorporate his purpose, practice, and people into this fun movie theme. And that kind of sucked. So again the AI was more of a thinker. Let's say the main topic for the week is hydration. The main idea was let hydration be your costar. We would have a safety brief with movie puns and  and how to hydrate and stay hydrated and then at the bottom of each brief, we would have purpose practice and people sections. Why do we hydrate? How do we hydrate? Who do we help by hydrating? So the very beginning of the project I didn't have any of this fleshed out. I ran it through AI many times to see how to connect the very corporate purpose practice people into the fun movie Summer Blockbuster, kind of theme. We got there eventually, but it took some time.

AI: That sounds like a really challenging creative puzzle - trying to bridge that gap between a fun movie theme and corporate messaging requirements. It's interesting that you describe going back to AI ""many times"" to work through that connection.

When you're working with AI in those iterative sessions, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am driving the decisions, but AI is working through ""does it make sense?"" Last year our safety is a habit campaign was successful because of a fluke that AI said. Again, I was working with a very corporate theme of habits and it's not very visual. So I was trying over and over again to get ideas on how to present it visually. The AI came up with cards that had the topic on it and on the cards it had a list of things they could check off of doing. Habits. But then it turned into. Hey why don't they do one of these habits each workday Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? And so our email would have the list of daily habits and the safety officers they loved it because they had a lesson for every day and it was all related tied up in a bow. It was great. So when I am using AI, I'm looking for that nugget of gold that is a new way of thinking about these topics.

AI: That's such a great example of how AI can surprise you with an unexpected connection that transforms the whole project. It sounds like you're really skilled at recognizing when AI gives you that ""nugget of gold"" - that moment when it offers something that shifts your thinking in a useful direction.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I can get project started much quicker. I don't have to stare at that blank page or toss things around in my mind as much. I just have to do some creative prompting with AI to see what it says. I can also work faster in that. It's almost like I have an intern. They're not perfect but they do the work quick. I can look at finessing and refining and executing rather than the thinking planning organizing stuff.

AI: That's a really vivid way to put it - having an intern who's fast but needs direction and refinement. It sounds like AI has shifted your role more toward the editorial and strategic side, which seems to play to your strengths.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I worry that AI will eventually be really, really good at sounding human. Then it'll give non-writers and non-creators a tool when they're not experts in that field. It's like when blogging took over journalism. They're not formally trained on the principles of balanced communication and answering who when where why and inverted pyramid and all that stuff but they're putting out information and people believe it. Right now people are using it as writing and they're not even taking out the stupid parts. It sounds very non-human at this point, but they think that's good writing. Now will we get there in the next five years I don't know. People have already tried to squash writing with AI with AI detectors. But those don't work very well and frankly, they've you know accuse me of using AI when I've written something from scratch. The creative field it's not like science where I couldn't just go into a lab and say well I told me to do this experiment. Once people figure out AI can help them be creative then human creativity is gonna go the way of journalism. Nobody will really know what role in plays.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern about the erosion of expertise and training. The journalism parallel is striking - that shift from trained professionals to anyone with access to the tools, and how that changes the quality and reliability of what gets produced.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I hope that my workplace embraces AI. I want it to continue to be an assistant but get more helpful and more nuanced. Like have a mode where you can say ""creativity mode"" or ""editorial mode"" and it would have some level of expertise. Right now it's the jack of all trades. Sometimes you get good ideas and sometimes it's like do you even know what creativity is? Those modes that I just mentioned could be also things like ""fitness mode"" ""financial advisor mode"" where people don't have to put in a long drawn out, prompt about being a financial advisor.

AI: That's a really compelling vision - having AI that can shift into specialized modes based on the type of thinking you need. It sounds like you want to maintain that assistant relationship but with more sophisticated domain expertise.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a thinking tool rather than a writing tool, and that great example of how the daily habits idea transformed your whole campaign.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I will say that I hope that the photography/video production capabilities of AI will improve a lot. But not so much where nefarious people are sending out fake videos about things and causing trouble. But the visuals as they are now are terrible. I would not use any of them.

AI: That's a really important point about the visual capabilities - wanting them to improve for legitimate creative work while being mindful of the potential for misuse. It sounds like you see a clear gap between where AI visuals are now and what would actually be useful for professional creative work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a thinking partner, the challenges of balancing corporate requirements with creative themes, and your thoughtful concerns about the future of expertise in creative fields - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the opportunities and the challenges you see ahead."
creativity_0124,"Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! As a note, I am a very dedicated hobbyist writer and artist, and do not actually work for any particular company. I have been creating all my life. The qualification said that was acceptable, so I just want to specify!

AI: That's perfect! Thank you for clarifying - dedicated hobbyist creators absolutely bring valuable perspectives to this research. In many ways, your experience might be even more interesting since you're choosing to integrate AI purely based on your own creative goals rather than any external requirements.

So to get us started - could you tell me a bit about your creative work? What kind of writing and art do you create, and what does a typical project look like for you?

User: On a personal level, I am an artist that works with many different mediums! I use pencil, pen, oil paint, OPEN acrylics (slow drying), etc. I also draw digitally. When I create personal pieces, I enjoy a spontaneous direction with my work. Collaboratively with my partner, we write a fantasy alien story together! We have been working on it for over five years. We eventually want to make it a comic, and explore many other mediums to express our story as well. Mythological and queer themes are also present and integrated into our project.

AI: That sounds like such a rich and varied creative practice! I love that you're working across so many different mediums and have this long-term collaborative project with your partner. Five years is quite a journey for a story.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools across your different artistic mediums and your writing work?

User: For visual art, I like to use AI for very loose conceptual ideas (such as color palettes), material research (used AI to help identify a vintage flake white oil paint the other week), and artform exploration (such as learning about obscure cultural techniques that are difficult to learn about). For writing, I use AI for very basic ideas such as learning about specific topics I want to write about but do not know how to structure (such as military power structures), looking for mythology to research, basic character concepts (such as animals to take inspiration from for character ideas), etc. With writing in particular, I like specific ideas to be anonymous when talking to an assistant for idea and concept security.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI more as a research assistant and creative catalyst rather than having it directly create content for you. I'm particularly intrigued by your approach to maintaining anonymity around your specific ideas for concept security.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as you were working through that creative process?

User: My partner and I recently used AI for one of our characters. He takes a lot of inspiration from amphibians and reptiles, but recently we discovered a popular character who looks crocodilian, which was quite similar to some of our concepts. We had to go back to the drawing board because we do not want our characters to be compared like that (design-wise), and so we discussed mythology ideas and animal ideas in order to get inspiration.

AI: Tell me more about that process - when you were working through that challenge with your partner and using AI to explore new directions, how did it feel to navigate that shift? And how did you approach the conversation with AI to get the kind of inspiration you were looking for while keeping your specific character details protected?

User: It felt nice to get some more ideas, and it allowed us to discuss many of the suggestions on our own! We did not directly specify which ideas we liked to the assistant, so it doesn't know whether we liked or disliked a suggestion for our particular character.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using the AI suggestions as a springboard for your own private discussions. When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: The collaboration overall is quite useful--when ideas are in jeopardy, it feels stressful, and AI takes a lot of confusion out of potential research directions for our creative processes and ideas. We like to let the assistant throw things at the wall and only give necessary direction for it to give relevant suggestions, as we independently enjoy refining and drafting our own finalized concepts or ideas.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as this broad generator while you maintain control over the refinement and final decisions. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has it shifted how you approach certain parts of your process, or opened up new possibilities you didn't have before?

User: Ease of researching, for sure! I love to do research and so does my partner, but especially with obscure mythology/folklore (for example) you sometimes have to go a long approach to even know certain concepts or figures exist, as you can't just start researching what you aren't aware of. Asking about particular deities or concepts that fit certain ideas in different regions is a lot easier to do and refine with AI vs asking roundabout questions on Google until you know what to look for. Stuff similar to that is a great use for AI, and allows us to focus our research and save time.

AI: That's such a great point about the discovery problem in research - you can't Google what you don't know exists! It sounds like AI has really opened up that initial exploration phase for you.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your creative fields - whether that's visual art, writing, or the broader creative landscape?

User: Ethics. I work with AI so I have a bit of a unique perspective, but so many artists are terrified right now because of their works getting scraped and losing value--this fear is very observable in digital visual artists. I work on a more offline-level creatively so I have less fear, but I feel bad for people who are losing work.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - having that insider understanding of AI while also seeing the real impact on fellow creators. It sounds like your more offline approach gives you some insulation from those concerns.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your own creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate using it differently, or in new ways as the technology develops?

User: I plan to use it similarly! I am wary about what I tell the models in order to avoid accidentally training it personal/unique ideas, but I think I have a good sense of keeping that personal space and AI is very helpful for research and providing pools of basic concepts or ways to experiment.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that boundary between AI-generated suggestions and your own private creative development with your partner, and how you've found AI so valuable for that initial discovery phase of research.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thank you, that's about it! My final remark is that, while definitely not as big as a hobby, AI gives really great and fun suggestions for original home building ideas in Sims! I use it very directly for that all the time, and it's very fun and stress-free because I don't really care about those ideas as much. It gives great suggestions on types of homes or spaces I can build and what kinds of rooms I can make and what kinds of furniture I can use. I might use AI for building ideas in my story in the future, because I feel like that can be low-stress!

AI: That's such a delightful example! I love how you've found this completely stress-free application where you can just play and experiment without any of the creative ownership concerns. And it's interesting how that might bridge into your story work for architectural elements - that seems like a natural extension where you could maintain your boundaries while still getting those fun, exploratory ideas.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency while leveraging AI as a research tool, and how you navigate the balance between collaboration and protection of your unique ideas, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your thoughtfulness throughout this conversation!"
