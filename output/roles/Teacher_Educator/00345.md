Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good for me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a montessori teacher and use AI for lesson planning and making reports for the students. I'd say I use it monthly for lesson planning, and only twice a year to help me write comments and reports for students.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI quite strategically for specific tasks. 

When you do use AI for lesson planning monthly, can you walk me through what that process looks like? What exactly are you asking the AI to help you with in those planning sessions?

User: I ask AI to take into account the season or special holiday, specific themes we are working with, or some ideas I have and expand upon them. I love to ask AI to brainstorm more ideas. For example, I ask it to brainstorm ideas for montessori activities with a winter theme.

AI: That brainstorming aspect sounds really valuable for your creative process. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to plan the montessori-specific lesson planning myself as the students are at different stages. Some children are 3 years old, some are 6 years old. So, it's not possible to make one lesson plan for the entire class. Also, sometimes I've noticed a specific montessori activity is suggested but it is one we don't currently have in the classroom. So, because we don't have a complete set of materials, I like to do this task on my own.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you need that deep knowledge of your specific students and classroom resources that AI wouldn't have access to.

When you do use AI for those brainstorming sessions or report writing, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it a request and let it handle that piece independently?

User: I first ask to brainstorm a list. If the list is too basic, or not original enough, I ask AI to create a new list and offer some guidance. For example, "make me winter activities for a montessori classroom with 3-6 year old students involving ice."

AI: So you're refining and guiding the AI to get to more specific, useful ideas. That's a really collaborative approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other teachers at your school use it similarly, or have there been any discussions about AI use?

User: I learned a lot from my coworkers. One of them uses AI to plan field trips. She asked it to make a permission for to give to the parents to sign. She also used it to translate the document from french to English (or the other way). I've also seen her use AI to make a list of objectives and goals for the field trip. She had different responsibilities from me, so I didn't use it in this way. But it gave me more ideas for how to use AI as a teacher

AI: That's fascinating how you're learning different AI applications from each other based on your different roles and responsibilities.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was really satisfied with AI when I was writing comments for my students

AI: Tell me more about that. What specifically about using AI for writing student comments made you feel so satisfied?

User: Originally, I made very thorough, detailed comments that took almost a full page for each student covering the various skills of the montessori classroom. My director let me know this was too detailed and I only needed one paragraph for each student. So, I asked AI to summarize my comments into one paragraph and I was so impressed because this saved me a lot of time

AI: That sounds like a perfect use case - you had all that detailed knowledge and observation, but needed it condensed into the right format. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your teaching work?

User: I don't consider the potential for AI to take over my role as a montessori teacher because it is very hands-on and individual for each student. The tasks I ask for help with such as brainstorming ideas can be done by myself through an internet search, but I prefer to save time.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective - you see AI as a time-saving tool for tasks you could do yourself, while your core teaching remains very human-centered.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different tasks as you get more comfortable with it?

User: Yes, I see myself using it for document creation. As of now, I just copy and paste the information from AI into my own documents. I would love to explore using AI for creating beautiful documents in PDF format. A complete document I can present to my director would be a great asset for me

AI: That's a great insight - moving from using AI-generated content as raw material to having it help create more polished, presentation-ready documents.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you maintain that essential human element in your teaching while strategically using AI for the more administrative and creative brainstorming tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it from me

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're integrating AI into your Montessori teaching practice - from seasonal brainstorming to condensing detailed observations into parent-friendly reports - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you and your colleagues are discovering different applications and learning from each other. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
