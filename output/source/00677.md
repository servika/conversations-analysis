Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. Let's go.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Right now, I mostly use it collaboratively for things like writing emails and content, doing research, and project planning. Sometimes I use it to help troubleshoot tech issues or analyze data too.

AI: That's a nice range of uses. When you say you use it "collaboratively" - could you walk me through what that looks like for one of those tasks, like writing emails or project planning?

User: For writing emails, here is the opening message of a recent time I did this: "Would you change anything about this message to a customer to make it more professional yet friendly and helpful? They haven't messaged me about their order, but I noticed the tracking hasn't updated so I'm sending them a message. Hi [REDACTED], I see that your order hasn't been scanned by USPS and still says pre-transit. Sometimes that happens and never gets updated but does get delivered, so I wanted to reach out and ask if you've received this yet? I did mail it out on the 28th, so if you haven't received it yet please let me know!! I'll be happy to pop a replacement in the mail for you. USPS does occasionally lose things, and I want to make sure you get your order. "  

Another instance, I first asked for "any general communication advice for emails when people don't seem to have read the whole thing? In the case with this client, I work hard to be complete in my email communications, but both contacts repeatedly proceed or ask for things that contrast with what I've told them. Maybe my emails are too long and they don't bother to read them all, I'm not sure. I keep wanted to say things like, "as I mentioned previously" but that people usually feel like that wording comes across brash or bitchy, and I'm really not sure how else to call this issue out. I am really tired of repeating things though." After it replied, it offered to help me write an email so my next message was "Sure, you can help with the email i'm writing now. For background, I have a client who I had been hosting their two websites. They are transferring them to other hosting and management teams. The new site director is asking that all emails for the site be forwarded to another email address. I need to explain to her that email is part of hosting services and the new hosting company will have to set up the emails to be exactly the same as they currently are. That once hosting services stop with me, there will be no more email service for me to forward unless the new company replicates the set up. That's why I outlined each email address in my last email to her so she can have them do that. I don't think she understands that email is part of hosting and I dont think I explain that very well. She also wants to redirect the site traffic to the new website and doesn't realize the new hosting or site management services will handle that. Can you help me write a response to her that explains it which sounds professional, is concise, and doesn't have a negative tone."

AI: That's really helpful context. I can see you're using AI as a thought partner - bouncing ideas off it and getting feedback before finalizing your approach.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I don't ask for much help with creative design ideation tasks. Sometimes, I'll ask for some ideation help, but mostly, I think the AIs I've used give generally generic ideas to help with creative things, at least in my industry and niche. I'm a strategic brand and graphic designer, and the times I've tried to use it to help with ideation for that work, the results are pretty generic or off the mark still. It's like asking a first-year design student to help with something that actually requires a senior-level designer, if that makes sense. It's not BAD, but it's not what I need either. It's too generic or short-sighted for the specialized work I do, I think.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you need that specialized, nuanced creative judgment that comes from your experience in your specific niche.

When you do use AI for those tasks we talked about earlier - the emails, research, project planning - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I always work collaboratively. I've never fully delegated a task yet, the margin for error is still too high for me to do that.

AI: Tell me more about that - what do you mean by the margin for error being too high?

User: If I ask for research information, I always ask for and check the sources. I'd estimate around 30% of the time, with the models I use at least, the model will hallucinate information or use sources that are not reputable, like reddit, blogs, or sites where the main purpose is marketing rather than factual/scientific. Sometimes the information itself is hallucinated, sometimes the references for that information are hallucinated, although the information itself might be reasonably plausible. Does that make sense?

AI: That makes perfect sense - you're essentially fact-checking everything because you've learned from experience that the AI can present plausible-sounding but incorrect information.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Well, I'm a small business owner and the sole person in my company, so I don't technically have traditional colleagues. But I do network with other peers in my industry online. While I'm already skeptical of bad information online so I generally worked this way already when using AI to help research things, I have also seen some peers use or depend on information that I knew, or had to show them, was incorrect. Incorrect stats or details, things like that. I might value evidence-based, factual information a bit more than most of my peers due to my previous background and experiences before my work now, though. But seeing them blindly trust whatever they are given really makes me want to be more diligent in my use. I also see how they treat it more like a robot than a partner, and something about that doesn't sit right with me. If an AI gives me more information, I'm going to correct it so we can continue on from the same factual standpoint I want to be using, just like if I were training a person. I don't think a lot of my peers really do that either.

AI: That's fascinating - you're approaching it more like training or teaching, while your peers treat it more transactionally. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I tried to use it once to help me figure out some equations to estimate how much of an interest charge I would have on a business credit card. I came back to that conversation after I got each bill for around 3-4 months, I'd give it all the neccessary information like the APR, last month's closing balance, new charges, payments made, and the monthly interest I was charged, and we just could never seem to get the right equation figured out to estimate that charge reasonably close for the next month. It was always very wrong. Maybe there was user error there somehow, because I'm not great at math/accounting, but I eventually gave up trying to guess what the interest charge would be and just waited for the bill. That seems like a task an AI would be well suited for too, so I'm not sure why I had trouble.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when it feels like exactly the kind of mathematical task AI should excel at, but it kept missing the mark despite multiple attempts.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Right now, I don't worry too much about that. I have considered it plenty though. A huge part of my job as a strategic designer and part of what sets me apart from other designers is my ability to help clients figure out what they need, compared to what they personally want or like, and helping them see the value in strategic design vs just aesthetic preferences. AI is a great tool for me to use, but it will be some time before I'm fully replaced by it. Also, there is such a wide variety of work that I do, and I think there will always be a market for human-made art. I think my ability to adapt and use AI collaboratively will help me stay ahead of being fully replaced by it for longer than others, possibly too, at least until AI develops actual human-level consciousness, I think.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're seeing AI as extending your capabilities rather than competing with them, especially in those strategic consultation areas.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Sure, I hope as it gets better I can begin to automate some new parts of my work and business, although I think I'll still have tasks I do collaboratively.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI more like a collaborative partner that you can train and correct, rather than just a tool to extract information from.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach, the importance of fact-checking, and how you maintain that strategic human element in your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
