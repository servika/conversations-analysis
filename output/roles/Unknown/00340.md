Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help analyze the production numbers and other KPI of my subordinates and to create a spreadsheet once a week to share with my team showing how they compare to their peers for the week. I will double-check new processes using AI to identify any obvious flaws. I also use it to create trivia and fun facts for daily standups.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of analytical and team-building uses. Tell me more about how you use AI for analyzing those production numbers and KPIs - what does that process typically look like for you?

User: I get hourly and daily production numbers for each teammate by the department and job they were in for that hour/day. When I come in each day as part of my pre-shift routine I will upload that information and ask for any insights as well as the top performer for each job and department. At the end of the week I upload the weekly numbers and ask for a spreadsheet in order of productiveness by department.

AI: That sounds like a very systematic approach. When you get those insights from AI about performance patterns or trends, how do you typically use that information? Do you act on it directly, or does it inform other decisions you make as a manager?

User: I have a brief 1-1 conversation with each teammember once a week and share their production for the week and show them how it compares to the previous week.  I discuss any patterns, both positive and negative. Sometimes when the patterns will show me they are getting less productive and that leads to discussing whether they want to cross train due to fatigue of the same positions or just learning they have personal/real life stuff going on and it is temporary. It helps me be a better leader with the check ins. I also use that information to help determine which position each team member works best in.

AI: It sounds like the AI insights really help you have more informed and supportive conversations with your team. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I use AI where it has been approved with my bosses because I can show the impact. I have not been allowed to automate tasks in several areas that I believe would make my workload easier but my bosses are not convinced its truly a benefit. An instance of this would be creating my daily duty roster, it would give me about an hour each week of my time for other things but my bosses do not believe that would be a net benefit.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - having to prove the value of AI use to get approval. When you are able to use AI for approved tasks like the production analysis, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: I tend to upload the information and ask for an analysis and any outliers in the information. Then I will look through this for anything that stands out to me and ask for a more in-depth analysis of anything that seems out of the ordinary or that I don't understand. So its a mix of independent and collaborative depending on what the data shows each day.

AI: That back-and-forth approach makes a lot of sense - starting broad and then drilling down based on what catches your attention. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned needing approval from your bosses - has that shaped how you think about or approach using AI?

User: Yes, definitely. It means I have to be more strategic about how I use AI and also to track how much time it takes for each task, showing big time savings helps with presenting it to my bosses. I also analyze the tasks I use AI for more, as I need to be able to explain how it is helpful and/or more efficient. I am one of two supervisors, out of 9 total, that utilize AI for my duties, so I document thoroughly as not everyone understands why and how I am doing what I do with the AI. I have been able to convince some of my colleagues to adopt some of my tracking spreadsheets and I use AI to create instructions on how to fill them out as most are less tech savvy as well.

AI: It sounds like you've become something of a pioneer and advocate for AI use in your workplace. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I wanted to create a system that tracked not just days or weeks but trends, I uploaded all of the data to AI and then asked for a spreadsheet that contained all of the jobs in the warehouse and showed every job each employee on my team did for the week and their daily average. We were tracking KPIs for the teams weekly/monthly but not for individuals. I then asked the AI to show me the average, above average and below average bands for each job and used that to highlight the spreadsheets green, yellow or red for each team member. This helped me create a spreadsheet that I can fill out with AI and also my less tech-savvy colleagues can fill out manually. Then I had it create instructions for those filling it out manually, for example how to highlight the team members numbers with the appropriate colors to see where they landed for the week. Now the whole warehouse uses those spreadsheets whether filling them out manually in excel or having the AI fill it in. This has made all shifts more aware of what is going on with their teams, even if it takes the others longer to create theirs. We still all have the same system and the associates appreciate knowing we all now evaluate them with the same criteria.

AI: That's a really impressive example of how you've created something that benefits not just your own workflow, but your entire warehouse team. It sounds like you took a complex data analysis challenge and turned it into a standardized system everyone could use.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I work in logistics, so I realize that parts of my job will likely be taken over, but I make sure to fully learn all new automated systems that we get because someone will always need to know how the AI works and what the output should look like to know when there is an issue. I also make sure to keep the skills that AI cannot take over, team-building, well-being check-ins, motivating the team, etc in mind and always pushing to be better so that I can focus on the people and the AI can help supplement my workflow.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - positioning yourself to work alongside AI rather than being replaced by it. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Hopefully I can keep pushing new systems into being supplemented with AI for quality checks and efficiency upgrades and to take duties that are time-consuming but data-driven off my plate and into automation so that I can come into work and analyze the reports instead of compiling them and then analyzing. This would lead to more time on the floor checking issues and checking in on my people.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've systematically built adoption across your warehouse and the way you're strategically positioning yourself to focus more on the human elements of leadership while letting AI handle the data compilation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all I can think of for now

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being a strategic advocate for AI adoption, the importance of documenting impact to gain organizational buy-in, and how you're thoughtfully balancing automation with human-centered leadership will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your approach - it's clear you've put a lot of thought into how to make AI work effectively in your workplace while keeping the focus on supporting your team. Thanks again!
