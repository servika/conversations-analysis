Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, let's start

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a game level designer for casual mobile games. I typically start by filling our beatchart in excel or google sheets. Beatchart is type of database of all levels we did and are currently doing. For current episode we need to figure out what names and ingredients we need to use. 

With names it is easy -- i copy placeholders and ask AI to come with names. it already knows the way i do it, so it is very efficient.

With ingredients... hm if i have a free time i work with AI to do a small script in Python to fill those automatically based on some rather complex rules. Just Ai is failing, but script works better.

The levels design process is 100% done by me. I tried to come with ideas how to teach Ai to come with level ideas, but those failed.

If i have time i use Ai to automate workflow routines. Mostly automatic check for design requirements, working with beatchart, doing a dashboard where i read content from levels jsons and display them in a comfortable for me and the team way.

AI: That's fascinating how you've found specific spots where AI works well and others where it doesn't. 

Tell me more about the level design process - what makes those ideas something that AI struggles with but you handle naturally?

User: First understanding the game board structure. For example i can ask please come with ideas for arrangement of game ingredient and visualize it. Even if it understood the way the board works (honeycomb of special dimensions for example) -- the resulting visualization would not be taking it into account literally, but rather use it as an inspiration

But there are other things that Ai needs to understand before being able to convert different ideas into a functional prototype. For example how ingredients interact, how different placements affect difficulty and flow and how it all fits into a specific game experience we're aiming for

AI: That really illuminates the complexity involved. It sounds like there are layers of game-specific knowledge and intuition that you bring to level design.

When you do work with AI on those automation tasks - like the Python scripts or the dashboard work - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: I'm rather bad at coding, but good at ideation and following up until the idea is implemented. So typically i'd outline the idea and work collaboratively on how can it be implemented and detailed. I usually ask not to generate any code on that stage, but rather work on architecture and high-level.
After idea is detailed enough and all tech is defined, I take Cursor for example (or another Ai powered dev tool) and we go through it step-by-step until there's a working prototype.
I typically divide work into smaller manageable and independant blocks, because coding is difficult and i like to have a functional blocks by the end of the day.
Never had AI generating a complete block of code without any modifications from my side. I usually increment in small steps, test, collaborate with AI until satisfactory (but not ideal).

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really thoughtful - breaking things down and testing as you go. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Not really. I have lots of things on me, delegating sounds good. But i delegate only if AI can do it better then me :)

AI: That's a very practical approach! 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has particular attitudes about AI tools, or has the company set any guidelines around their use?

User: I see that our company encourages using AI, but there are certain things we're conscious. For example non disclosure agreements with our clients. I don't know how to handle them. And neither my managers know. So we generally NOT using AI on client data. But for automating workflows and creating a comfortable online workplace as we work from home -- that it a big field to explore.
From my colleagues i see lots of fear of Ai replacing our jobs, which is possible probably. Not the LLM though, but deep learning for specific game with loads of levels already. And with the recent layoffs in game industry that it a big stress factor.
From my perspective i'm one of the drivers of developing and integrating those tools, so i don't look for what other think but rather influence their thinking

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - seeing both the potential and the real concerns your colleagues have, especially with the industry layoffs adding stress.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When i did the toolkit for one of the previous games i worked on. That saved us a lot of time designing the levels by automating most of the routines and freeing space for creative work. 
Or when the client's tool stopped working for a while and i developed a small html+javascript tool for our lead in 1 hour that was solving that problem on our end. I could see them beaming for several weeks. Ppl were super grateful

AI: That sounds incredibly rewarding - especially seeing your lead's reaction and how it freed up time for the creative work. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI taking over is a myth. I'd be more concern about people lagging behind and stopping using their brains and creative power.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - focusing more on people staying engaged rather than AI replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I love creative work. And AI can help make it less stagnant. Plus it is a big helper already in implementing different ideas, in coding specifically. Working more efficiently and less time, spending more on developing management and leadership qualities rather then just simple "do you work" approach.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI being a tool that can free up space for creative work rather than replace it, and how you've become a driver of AI integration in your workplace.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think i covered everything. Unfortunately that's still just a small portion of work that i can use AI for.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of AI integration - from the specific tasks where it excels to the creative work that remains uniquely human - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear from someone who's actively exploring AI's potential while staying grounded about its current limitations. Thank you again!
