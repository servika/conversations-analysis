Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. I'm ready to dive in.

AI: Great! I'm excited to hear about your work. 

Let's start at the beginning - could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: Sure thing, though I must apologize - this particular project is ongoing so I won't share too many details. Briefly, I was investigating the oxidative degradation of model pollutants by combination nanomaterials made in our lab. The process for our group is fairly straightforward: Brainstorm modifications to a base material, review literature to assess the planned study's novelty, perform experiments, analyze data, write, submit. And if anything surprising happens, that's kept for further study.

AI: That's a really clear overview of your process - thank you for walking me through that even with the ongoing nature of the project. The combination nanomaterials for pollutant degradation sounds fascinating.

So looking at that workflow you described - from brainstorming modifications through to submission - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I dabbled in using AI tools for literature review and manuscript writing.

AI: Tell me more about that dabbling - what did that look like in practice for both the literature review and manuscript writing parts?

User: For literature review, it looked like uploading relevant articles as context for questions I might have regarding the entire body of knowledge - What materials have been investigated? What synthetic techniques were used? Are any materials missing X characterization? Do any studies abstain from probing reaction mechanisms? What follow-up studies are proposed for X materials? etc. When writing manuscripts I typically ask the model to look for anything I may have missed, errors in style, small first-draft edit type things.

AI: That's really helpful detail - I can see how you're using AI as almost a research assistant and editor in those areas. 

For those specific tasks you mentioned - like asking AI to identify missing characterization or probing gaps in reaction mechanisms - tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that kind of literature analysis.

User: It really came down to literature volume. With relatively small sets of papers it doesn't take too long to assess things like the materials investigated, synthetic methods, and characterization. With larger sets it can take a while, and that's where I would have the model take a first pass at some of these assessments.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - volume as the key deciding factor. So for the larger literature sets where AI takes that first pass, how do you then verify or validate what it produces? What does your process look like after the AI gives you its initial assessment?

User: If the model identifies specific papers or sets of papers I'll verify those first, otherwise I'll look for the most interesting claims and ask which papers they came from.

AI: That's a smart verification approach. Now I'm curious about the flip side - thinking about the other parts of your research workflow where you haven't used AI yet, like the brainstorming modifications, the actual experiments, or the data analysis. What's kept you from trying AI in those areas?

User: In my field material modifications can be made on any number of axes and be considered novel, I don't really need help brainstorming in that respect. Our experimental battery is fairly well defined and doesn't change much. For data analysis the hardest part is plotting everything with consistent conventions. However, for interpretation of the data my hesitation is that there's nuance that models might misapply.

AI: That nuance concern is really interesting - you mention that's specifically what holds you back from using AI for data interpretation. Can you tell me more about what kind of nuance you're worried a model might miss or misapply when interpreting your results?

User: To write a cohesive story requires constant recall of why each experiment was done, what different results mean, and what they collectively imply for further study. And that recall also needs to exist in the broader context of the literature review and the rationale for the research. My hesitation is that when I ask the model to interpret my results is that the model will write, in effect, a lengthy caption describing each graph instead of tying the results together into one fluid narrative.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the difference between describing individual results versus weaving them into that cohesive narrative that connects everything back to your original research rationale. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would love for AI to perform benchtop chemistry on my behalf - labs routinely contain hazardous materials.

AI: That's such a practical and safety-focused wish! The hazardous materials aspect is something I hadn't considered but makes complete sense.

Those are all my main questions - your perspectives on using AI strategically for high-volume literature review while being cautious about nuanced interpretation were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Not at this moment. Thanks for your time.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about how literature volume drives your AI usage decisions, and especially your point about the difference between describing results versus creating cohesive narratives, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's been great learning about your thoughtful approach to integrating these tools where they add value while maintaining your expert judgment where it matters most. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again for your time today!
