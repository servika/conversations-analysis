Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a daycare provider so I use AI to create schedules and meal plans for the week. I also use it to help create activities to do with the kids.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helps you with a lot of the planning aspects of your work. 

When you're creating these schedules, meal plans, and activities, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like? How do you typically interact with the AI to get what you need?

User: I usually give a list of the requirements for the task at hand, so for meal plans, I mention any food preferences or allergens, how many kids for which meal, and anything I want to be included in that week.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're giving it the constraints and parameters upfront. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your daycare work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I use AI for almost every task I can.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you've found AI quite useful across the board. 

When you are using AI for these various tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it handle things independently?

User: I give it as much information as I can up front, however, it usually takes a few back and fourths before I get a final "draft" that aligns with what I am looking for

AI: That gives me a good picture of your workflow - starting with comprehensive information but then refining through iterations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other daycare providers you know use it similarly, or has your approach developed more independently?

User: I run an independent daycare, I do know other providers who use AI in similar manners but I use it because I enjoy it and not from a recommendation.

AI: That's great that you discovered and embraced it on your own because you genuinely enjoy using it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes when preparing meal plans, the chatbot ignores some of my requests. For example, I'll mention in my initial instructions I don't want salmon on the menu and they will put it on there anyway.

AI: That sounds frustrating - especially when you've been clear about specific requirements like avoiding certain foods. 

Tell me more about that. When something like the salmon situation happens, how do you handle it? Do you find yourself having to be more explicit or repetitive about certain types of requests?

User: Yes, I will have to repeat that I did not want salmon on the menu and they will add one meal instead of recreating the meal plan with the updated meal.

AI: So it sounds like it makes these piecemeal adjustments rather than taking a more holistic approach when you point out the error.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your daycare work?

User: I have no concerns of AI stealing my job, no.

AI: That's interesting - you feel secure in your role. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it in new ways, or expanding how you currently use it?

User: If there were things that came up that AI could be helpful with, I would implement it, however, my job does not really change and other things are unlikely to come up.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you've found a good fit for your current needs.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated hearing about your iterative process and how you've independently embraced AI because you genuinely enjoy working with it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your daycare work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's it.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you use AI for planning and the practical challenges you face - like having to repeat specific requirements - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
