Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds pretty self-explanatory, so no questions so far from my end. Let's start

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically find myself using AI at my day job as a customer service person at a local restaurant when we're closed, like for when I need help solving maintenance or janitorial problems. For instance, I've used AI to help me find the right toilet seat I need to buy for the toilet we have, asked it how to properly restick a tile to the wall, and used it to visualize ideas for our in-progress patio renovation.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI to solve very hands-on, practical problems. 

Tell me more about how you approach these maintenance situations. When you encounter something like the loose tile or need to find that toilet seat, what makes you think to turn to AI rather than, say, calling a contractor or looking it up in a different way?

User: In these two particular cases, I knew going in that I have the physical ability to complete those simple-enough tasks even though I wasn't sure of the processes. So I had AI (Gemini, I believe) link me to my local ace hardware store website for a matching toilet seat and required supplies for the tile, like grout or spackle (whatever it was), and asked for instructions on how to do each fix. Some things, like fixing the A/C when it fails or fixing/changing door locks, I would feel uncomfortbale doing myself, so those times are when I would call a contractor.

AI: That's a really clear way of thinking about it - using AI when you know you can handle the task but need the knowledge piece. 

When you're working through those instructions that AI gave you - like for the tile repair - how do you typically interact with it? Are you going back and forth with questions as you work, or do you get all the information upfront and then go do the task?

User: I prefer to get all of the information upfront presented in an organized list of logical steps, but if I have issues with a particular step, that's when I'll go back and ask for clarification

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you want the roadmap first, then troubleshoot as needed.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: When I'm looking for contractors in these maintenance situations, I suppose I could use AI to help me find the best local company with ratings, reviews, pricing, services, etc., but we pretty much have established vendors for most of those things already, and even when d we don't, word-of-mouth between restauranteurs in this town is everything, so vendors and contractors are pretty universal here. Using AI to try out new companies would make me nervous, especially given that AI knowledge and interpretations aren't always completely accurate.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - you're comfortable using AI for the technical "how-to" information, but when it comes to choosing who to trust with your business, you rely on the established relationships and local knowledge.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Most of the time, AI usage works out for me without giving me grief, and those projects usually wrap up satisfactorily, but without note. I have been frustrated by Ai's occasional failings though, both in and out of the work space, and usually it's on something really obvious. For instance, when we were trying to pick a paint color for the wall in the patio, AI (either Copilot or Gemini, can't remember right now) it kept refering to the colors in the photo I sent as shades of red when they were shades of dark and light greens.

AI: That's a perfect example of where AI's limitations become really apparent - something that would be obvious to anyone looking at the photo, but the AI just got completely wrong.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at the restaurant use it similarly, or are you kind of pioneering this approach?

User: I'm pretty much the only one using it for Front-of-House operations, as far as I know. My boyfriend handles pretty much everything else that I don't, including menus, POS integration, payroll, etc, but he's not as open-minded on the tech front, so I can't imagine him adopting AI for those uses anytime soon, even though I think that some trusted programs could be adopted to lighten his manual work load

AI: So you're kind of the early adopter in your workplace - that's interesting that you see potential applications for your boyfriend's work but he's more hesitant about the technology.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really concern you given the types of tasks you're using it for?

User: The mom-and-pop passion that we have in our unique restaurant doesn't lend itself particularly well to automation, so other than the clerical tasks that would require specialized AI programs and the simple, occasionlal LLM-powered problem solving I do, I can't imagine too many areas in which AI could meaningfully improve much. Perhaps we could someday integrate our inventory sheets and somehow have AI automatically order everything on the list from the correct suppliers

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - you see AI as useful for those specific problem-solving moments and potentially some behind-the-scenes logistics, but the core of what makes your restaurant special isn't something that would benefit from automation.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, or do you think you've found your sweet spot with how you currently use it?

User: Like I said before, perhaps we could someday integrate our inventory sheets and somehow have AI automatically order everything on the list from the correct suppliers. But other than that, I think our relationship with AI is likely to stay the same for the foreseeable future, or at least unitl my boyfriend hires someone to do his clerical work for him who happens to use AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you distinguish between tasks where AI's knowledge is helpful versus situations where local relationships and trust matter more.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for practical problem-solving while maintaining the personal, relationship-based aspects of your restaurant business will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
