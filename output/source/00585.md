Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: All sounds good, Claude, thanks. I'm happy to go ahead.

AI: Perfect, thank you! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I would say that I mostly use AI for online content production with my work. I work for a software company and manage and develop our website. This obviously involves web page creation, and also blog posts, and I use AI to develop content for these. I work collaboratively with the AI, and ask it for inspiration at times, while also providing it with existing content to refine or expand, and improve. With blog posts, I sometimes have my own ideas, and ask it for content, while at other times, I ask the AI for post ideas, and then work from there. At all times, I will take the content created by the AI and then go over it myself, sometimes changing it quite a bit. With that, I always use the AI to create posts for social media, to publicise and direct towards the new content, or even existing content at times.

AI: That's a really detailed picture of how you're integrating AI into your content workflow. It sounds like you've developed quite a collaborative approach.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I should also say that I do use it for emails, and helping write responses to customers, or even for mail shots when we are pushing products, or have news to let customers know.

AI: Thanks for adding that - emails and customer communications are definitely an important part of the picture.

Going back to my question about preferences - are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks feel different to you?

User: I do some development work on the website as well, and also use SQL and Crystal Reports at times also. I always prefer to handle these myself, although I know AI could help. I perhaps feel that by asking AI to help me with these I may start to get "rusty" and my skills might diminish somewhat, so prefer to take them on myself.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the concern about skills getting rusty is something I hear about but not everyone articulates it so clearly.

When you do use AI for your content work - the blog posts, web pages, and emails - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete brief and let it handle a whole piece independently?

User: That would really depend on the circumstances to be honest.
If I am aware of what I want the content to be, for example, when we are releasing a new product, I will likely feed information to the AI and ask it to produce something for me, whether that's a blog post, web page, or a mail shot. There can be quite a bit of back and forth with the AI after this, as I try to perfect the content.
At other times, I can run out of ideas for my monthly blog post, and I will ask the AI for ideas, and decide on one to run with. At that point I may just ask the AI to write a full blog post, although after the initial production there will typically be some collaborative effort, and I would usually produce the final content in my own words to some extent.
With emails, in terms of replying to customers, I will provide the AI with the mail I am replying to, give it information on how I may wish to reply, and then work with what it gives me in response.
Very rarely would I let the AI work on something for me completely independently.

AI: That gives me a really clear sense of how fluid your approach is depending on the situation. It sounds like there's almost always some back-and-forth, even when you start with a complete brief.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I'll be honest, I can't say I have taken much from my colleagues or workplace to influence the way I use AI at work. I haven't actually discussed it with anyone at work. My work is quite a backwards place, despite the sector they are in, and I think they would almost view using AI as cheating.

AI: That's really interesting - you're navigating AI use in an environment where it might not be fully accepted or understood. It sounds like you've developed your approach pretty independently.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, I suppose last year we released a completely new version of our main software product. I used the AI to write a blog post, a new web page, an email newsletter, and social media posts, all for this new product. I asked my developers for the information on what was new, and what key features there were that might interest customers, or potential customers, and then fed this to the AI to develop a blog post originally. From the blog post, I then worked on a new web page, and a newsletter incorporating the information from the blog. The social media posts were then designed with the AI to maximize attention, and try to gain interest from those that would be viewing. I was particularly pleased with this as it did bring the company several new sales, and a lot of attention from existing customers who had been quiet for some time, so it worked exactly as I wanted.

AI: That sounds like a really successful campaign where you orchestrated multiple pieces of content working together. The fact that it drove actual sales and re-engaged quiet customers must have been incredibly satisfying.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? You mentioned this earlier with development work - is this something you actively consider in other areas too?

User: Not really, if I am being honest. I like using AI, and it does help make things easier at times, to give me more time to myself, or for other ventures.

AI: That's refreshingly honest - it sounds like you've found a balance that works for you, where you're strategic about where you want to maintain hands-on skills versus where you're comfortable leveraging AI for efficiency.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think my company may eventually incorporate AI into our products to some extent and, so, the skills I have developed with AI in recent times, will be of great use to the company as a whole. I think as we move forward, I will continue to use AI in the way that I am doing, but the results will get better and I will become more efficient with my time and possibly have more time for other projects and helping the company in other ways.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being selective about where you maintain hands-on skills versus where you leverage AI for efficiency, and how you've developed this collaborative approach despite working in an environment that might not fully embrace AI yet.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, it's okay, thanks.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing this independent, collaborative approach to AI - especially in an environment that hasn't fully embraced it yet - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
