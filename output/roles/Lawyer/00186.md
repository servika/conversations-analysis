Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good and no I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a lawyer in civil litigation. I don't use AI every day, but I do occasionally use it to help me draft and review simple and complex motions or briefs. This includes wording and phrasing for the motions as well as helping me to with initial research steps for legal analysis.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. When you say you use it for initial research steps for legal analysis, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you approach that process?

User: Sure! So let's say I have a motion for a continuance that I need to draft. I will think of the arguments that I would like to make in favor of my motion. For example, delay in response from opposing counsel or unanticipated family emergency caused delay in response times, etc. I would then ask AI to please help me find cases in Maryland, (jurisdiction that the case law is needed for) where a continuance was granted due to a a delay caused by opposing counsel's unresponsiveness.

AI: That's a really clear example, thank you. So you're using AI to help identify relevant case law based on the specific circumstances of your situation. 

When AI provides you with those case suggestions - let's say it gives you several Maryland cases about continuances granted due to opposing counsel delays - what do you typically do next? How do you work with that information?

User: Typically, AI will give me a string citation for the case law and a short summary of what happened in the case. I will review the various summaries and select the ones I think will be the most helpful. Then copy the citation into my legal research database so that I can locate the case and review the case for the same context. Also if AI uses any quotes, I am reviewing the case to locate those exact quotes and then I am reading the context around those quotes to ensure that everything accurately aligns with the position I want to present.

AI: That verification process you describe sounds really thorough - copying citations into your legal database and checking the context around any quotes. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain legal tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Sure. I tend to write e-mails to clients myself. Even long e-mails that have substantive legal explanations. I like to draft them myself. Since these are client facing e-mails, I want them to be personalized thoughtful and really sound like it is coming from me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that personal connection with clients through your own voice and tone. 

When you do use AI for tasks like drafting motions or briefs, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the drafting process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and then work with what it produces?

User: I collaborate with AI heavily when asking for help with drafting.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration process. What does that back-and-forth look like when you're working together on a draft?

User: I usually give it a general idea of what I want to write. If its a simple motion I may ask it to take a stab at drafting the entire motion. But I will provide a lot of background and factual information about the case and my arguments. If it is a more complex motion I will typically start section by section or paragraph by paragraph. For example, I may ask it to help me draft the facts section for an appellate brief, but then I will explain that for the first paragraph I only want to focus on the facts that took place between 2021 and 2022. I will then provide those facts and then we will tweak from there until we get the paragraph good enough for it to go into the draft. When I say tweak, I mean that if I am unsatisfied I will ask AI to incorporate more of the details, use a more impactful tone, or take out any fluffy wording. Then I will move on to the next paragraph and ask AI to help draft the facts from 2022 to 2023 and so on and so forth until my facts section is complete. I will then go through the facts section myself to make sure that all of the information is correct. I will also occasionally, change the wording or add in additional information that I did not provide to the AI.

AI: That's a really detailed picture of how you work together - it sounds like quite an iterative process where you're guiding the direction and then refining as you go.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that played a role in how you've approached using these tools?

User: Yes! Unfortunately, AI still has a lot of growing to do. I know this mostly from personal experience, but also in the legal industry many lawyers have been getting fined or sanctioned by the court system for using AI generated legal citations. Citations that were hallucinated by AI and simply not real. I was already aware of this problem but because it is clear that more and more lawyers are using AI and are also using it irresponsibly it has pushed me to really focus on taking a very thorough approach to using it.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like those broader industry issues have actually shaped you to be more careful and methodical in your approach. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. I have felt satisfied mostly when AI has helped me to save so much time because it quickly found relevant statues and or case law and incorporated them accurately and seamlessly into a simple motion. I then only had to spend about 20 - 30 minutes perfecting the motion. This gave me more time to focus on making the motion really perfect and tightening it to be a solid submission versus spending so much time brainstorming, researching, and compiling basic information for a standard motion.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience - having more time to focus on the strategic refinement rather than the foundational work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about this, but because I am a civil litigator and my role requires in court representation I do believe there is some form of Constitutional limitation that would likely stop AI from being able to physically show up to court to represent individuals. Even if that does happen I do believe I'm pacing well to keep up and stay ahead of AI on various levels that would ensure that I will always have work. Trust is really important when engaging someone for legal representation but also for the judicial system as a whole. People want to feel like they can truly trust the judicial system to give them fair representation and fair outcomes. I have hopes to progress to become a judge and I do believe that we won't see AI robots replacing judges on the bench for at least another 30 plus years.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the longer-term implications and how your career trajectory positions you.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you personally?

User: I hope Ai will continue to get smarter and brighter. I hope AI will continue to be a useful tool specifically for small business owners and small shop practitioners like myself. While I do hope there will be more regulations around Ai, I believe that it is so useful that it should continue to grow and expand. Unfortunately, I do see Ai replacing certain administrative roles such as Legal Assistants, Billing specialists, and Paralegals. This has been great for me however, because it has allowed me to keep my overhead costs low while still providing incredible representation and service. I hope to continue using and collaborating with AI to advance my career and the work that I really aspire to do.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the industry sanctions have shaped your verification practices, and how AI has allowed you to focus more time on perfecting your work rather than just compiling basic information.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I've said a mouthful thanks for listening.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've developed such a careful, collaborative approach to using AI - especially given the challenges facing the legal industry - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the risks you've observed. Take care!
