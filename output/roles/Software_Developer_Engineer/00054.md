Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I researched single-species diffusion equations in mathematical biology, these are can be used to model the spread of a gene through a population or the spread of disease. The research involved deriving equations for the spread of the population and then studying the solutions behaviour using eigenvalue stability analysis

AI: That sounds like fascinating work - modeling population dynamics through mathematical equations. 

Tell me more about that process - from when you first had the idea to study these diffusion equations through to completing your stability analysis. What were the main steps you went through?

User: the main steps were: identifying the topic i was interested in, researching the area using papers and books, finding an equation to solve, using python to plot the phase plan diagrams, analysing the solutions and explaining them, i then gave a presentation on it

AI: That's a really clear breakdown of your research process. Now I'm curious - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI tools a lot to help with the graph plotting with python as this is quite a laborious and moderately simple task that AI makes very quick. I also used AI when i was curious about a certain aspect of the project and wanted to find resources to read about it. and occasionally used ai to help explain certain maths although i didnt find this very productive

AI: Interesting - so you found AI really helpful for the Python plotting but less so for explaining the mathematics. 

For the graph plotting specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for that task.

User: i decided to use ai because it (very quickly) gives an excellent basis and 'skeleton' code for the graph plotting, which i could then edit to how i wanted it to look. it just makes this part a lot quicker so makes sense to use

AI: That makes a lot of sense - getting that skeleton code quickly to build from. 

Now thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like the eigenvalue stability analysis or deriving the equations - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Because of prior experience with AI making frequent and heavy mistakes with more involved mathematics I am quite hesitant to get it to do this for me as it is not always right. As an oppose to the coding where you can quite quickly see the result of the AI's work with maths you often can not if you do not have a clear solution and finding the mistake can be very boring and length and as a result you end up doing the maths yourself anyway. Furthermore, I am hesitant to become reliant on AI for getting it to do stuff I am new to, as this way I will never learn and then what is the point of doing it in the first place

AI: Those are really thoughtful reasons - the difficulty of spotting mathematical errors and your concern about learning versus reliance. 

When you have used AI for the graph plotting, how do you verify or validate what it produces to make sure it's doing what you intended?

User: its normally pretty obvious because you have an idea of what it should look like, whether this be because you know certain points are saddle points or anything and you know certain values on the graph. also a quick look over the code for the graph will confirm that the correct equations have been implemented

AI: That makes perfect sense - you have enough mathematical intuition about what the output should look like to catch issues quickly.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Here's my next question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: I would say ingenuity and creativity, coming up with new ideas that work

AI: That's a really insightful answer - the creative spark of generating new ideas that actually work is such a core part of research. 

Tell me more about what that looks like for you - when you're trying to come up with new approaches or ideas in your mathematical biology work, what does that process feel like or involve?

User: It is quite a long process and requires a lot of reading and some intuition, I think you need a clear idea of what you want to do but how youre going to do it is the hard part. It requires a lot of experimenting and trial and error

AI: Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits into different stages of research work were particularly insightful. The distinction you drew between tasks where errors are easily spotted versus those where they're hard to catch, and your thoughtful approach to balancing efficiency with learning, really stood out.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no, thank you

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point for coding while being cautious about mathematical work - and especially your point about wanting AI to help with the creative ideation process - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. I really appreciate your time today!
