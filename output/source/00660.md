Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Corporate uses it for offering suggestions to clients for outfits and purchases as well as data analysis. I don't use it on a typical day, unless I'm using it to answer somewhat random questions. For instance, the other day I used it to give me an estimate for the cost per square foot of carpet installation.

AI: That's interesting - so you have this contrast where your company is using AI for client-facing recommendations and analysis, but your personal use tends to be more for quick information lookups like that carpet cost estimate.

Tell me more about those random questions you mentioned. What prompts you to turn to AI for those kinds of queries?

User: I can get a quick answer with at least some detailed information for those types of queries. I don't need deep research done, but I also don't have the time to do all the searching to find the information.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like AI fills this middle ground for you between a simple Google search and doing extensive research yourself.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Tasks that involve a deep dive on customer habits I would save for myself because there might be intuitive connections about style and spending habits that I think need human expertise.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the intuitive connections around style and spending habits that you feel require that human expertise.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it. I'll ask a question or feed it some data for it to interpret and then have a conversation about it.

AI: So you're having more of a back-and-forth dialogue with it rather than just giving it something and walking away.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Unfortunately, I don't have enough autonomy in my role to make use of it as much as I'd like to.

AI: That's an important point - the autonomy factor. Can you tell me more about that? What would you want to use AI for if you had more freedom to integrate it into your work?

User: I would use it for time-consuming and repetitive tasks such as reading timesheets or if able to look up transfers and their accompanying tracking numbers to determine if product had been received. Any of these type of tasks that involve a lot of clicking and opening multiple tabs.

AI: I see - so those administrative, repetitive tasks that eat up time but don't really require your expertise in style and customer insights.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Creating an estimate for remodeling a room to make it into a space for "pop-up" shops or trunk shows. I gave the dimensions and the idea, and then we had a conversation about materials and layout, so that I eventually had a rough estimate to propose to our corporate team. This was satisfying.

AI: That sounds like a really productive collaboration - starting with your vision and dimensions, then working through the details together to get something concrete you could take to corporate.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't actively consider this because so much of my job requires a physical presence and soft skills around people management that I'm not worried AI could replace me.

AI: That's a confident perspective - the physical presence and people management skills as your differentiators.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: What I would like to happen and I think will happen is that it will eventually take over some of the time-consuming administrative tasks, like opening IT tickets through JIRA, checking timesheets, reading and summarizing reports, etc.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you see AI handling the administrative burden while you focus on the intuitive, relationship-based aspects of your role.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Only that it is in the very early stages of adoption at the store level. AI has been used at the corporate level for a while now, but is only just starting to be used by individual stores.

AI: That's a really valuable insight about the different adoption timelines between corporate and store level - thank you for sharing that.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the contrast between corporate AI use and individual store adoption, plus your thoughtful perspective on collaboration versus delegation, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
