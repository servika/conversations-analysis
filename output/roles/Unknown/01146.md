Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't have any questions, you can begin.

AI: Great, thank you! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I primarily edit my own YouTube videos, but I have edited for others in the past. I don't find the AI features in premiere pro particularly useful, so I mostly use Sora image generator to copy Thumbnail styles and Google Veo 3 to create b roll clips and brainstorm ideas

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI more for the visual assets around your videos rather than the editing process itself. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for these AI tools like Sora and Google Veo 3?

User: Well not exactly, I often find I can better connect clips together by generating an AI video or using it create a type of short "meme," which I would consider form of editing. Veo 3 has just been the best since its release, so I generally use that model. So, for example, a funny ai clip can better emphasize a point in the video, or tie together two clips that aren't directly related. 
Generally I'll think about the type of video I need to improve my content and just start prompting and making tweaks until I get what I need. Sometimes the voice doesn't match up perfectly and I'll voice over it myself or use elevenlabs.
I've also generated effects on a green or black screen and used those in my videos

AI: That's fascinating - so you're using AI-generated clips almost like punctuation or connective tissue in your videos. The idea of using AI to create those transitional moments or emphasis points is really creative.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI in this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the creator?

User: Yeah I recently mentioned the streamer, Asmongold, in a video and wanted something funny to go along with it. So I created an exaggerated cartoon style video of a balding man streaming out of a ridiculously dirty room with roaches crawling all over his garbage. I thought it added some comedy to the video and the viewers seemed to think it was funny

AI: That's a great example - you're using AI to create visual comedy that amplifies your commentary. It sounds like you had a very clear creative vision of what you wanted and used AI to execute that specific idea.

When you're working with AI in moments like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions - is it more like you're directing the AI, or does the AI sometimes surprise you with ideas you hadn't considered?

User: Yeah, in that case I was directing the AI to generate the vising that I had. However, in the past, I've talked with Gemini and ChatGPT and just brainstormed with them. Like I sometimes give a rough idea of what I want and the model often does come up with a surprisingly good idea. Like it's surprising that they can parse through reddit comments to see what viewer would enjoy. Plus they generally keep it fairly PG and not overly "mean."

AI: That's really insightful - so you've got this dual relationship where sometimes you're the director with a clear vision, and other times you're more like creative collaborators brainstorming together. It sounds like the AI's ability to understand your audience and maintain that balance of humor without going too far is particularly valuable.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in these ways?

User: Well it definitely saved a lot of time. I used to subscribe to stock websites like envato elements to find relevant b-roll video, but it never fit exactly how I wanted. Sometimes I would pull memes from the internet and I still do, but you always run the risk of copyright infringement when you use other video content. I feel safer and more in control when using AI to generate exactly waht I'm looking for. This is even more important when I'm editing for someone else since it would be terrible to get someone else's content a potential copystrike.

AI: That's a really important point about control and copyright safety - it sounds like AI has given you both creative freedom and legal peace of mind. The ability to generate exactly what you envision rather than settling for close-enough stock footage seems like a significant shift.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in video creation more broadly?

User: I don't have concerns personally. I would more than happy for AI to be able to completely automate editing and I can just focus on more creative aspects. However, I could see that as an issue for people who edit  as their only source of income. A true generational leap in video generation/editing would also hurt other industries like animation. I think AI is pretty far off from complete automation, but maybe it will take away many entry level jobs in the coming years.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you see AI as potentially freeing you up for the parts of the creative process you find most fulfilling, while recognizing the real economic impact on others in the industry.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? What would you want AI to be able to do that it can't do well enough yet?

User: Ultimately I would love for video generation to be able to expand or edit an existing clip. I think that's extremely far off, since even doing that perfectly to images at least another iteration or two away. One thing I hate doing is using the roto brush in after effects, if that could be automated it would be amazing.

AI: Those are really specific technical wishes - being able to seamlessly edit existing footage and automating tedious tasks like rotoscoping. It sounds like you have a clear vision of where you'd want the technology to go.

You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has given you more creative control while also providing that copyright safety net, and your balanced view on the industry impacts.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Well I also use suno to add music to my videos or elevenlabs for sound effects which can help with enhancing certain aspects of the video. This also lets me control exactly the type of music I want without having to look through a ton of different songs on a stock website like envato.

AI: That's a great additional point - so you're using AI across multiple aspects of the audio-visual creation process, not just the video elements. It really reinforces that theme of having precise creative control rather than having to compromise with existing stock content.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a creative collaborator and a tool for greater control - while being mindful of the broader industry implications - have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about your workflow and your perspective on where this technology is heading.
