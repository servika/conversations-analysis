Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

Everything you share won't be personally attributed to you, and the insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, no questions on my end so far!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a recruiter that almost exclusively uses LinkedIn to identify candidates for our openings. AI has been built into the search features as the default search option and there are AI functions for writing messages to candidates as well.  I still prefer to manually build out my search parameters, but I do utilize AI for messaging.

AI: That's interesting that you choose to handle the search manually even though AI is the default option. Tell me more about what draws you to building out those search parameters yourself rather than letting AI handle that part.

User: I have found that my own searching has been more accurate and easier to manipulate to narrow or broaden searches more quickly. For example, I primarily recruit for General Manager positions, but our ideal candidate is a veteran, with an MBA and management consulting experience- not what one may typically think of when searching for this role.  We don't even post the jobs in most cases because the applicants aren't what we are looking for as they are usually GM's with a hospitality or retail background and we have a different hiring strategy.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you have very specific criteria that might not align with typical expectations for that role title. When you do use AI for messaging candidates, how does that work for you? What does your process look like there?

User: LinkedIn has an offering to generate messaging built into the platform and I have utilized that as well as taking my own message templates and uploading them into a platform like ChatGPT to improve what I have.  It does come in handy since it is a limited talent pool that I am constantly recruiting from so I am sometimes messaging the same people multiple times over the years and using AI helps differentiate the messages.

AI: That's a smart approach - using AI to help vary your messaging when you're reaching out to the same talent pool repeatedly. Can you walk me through what a typical interaction with AI looks like when you're working on those messages? Are you collaborating with it back and forth, or do you tend to give it what you need and let it handle the task?

User: Most often I am feeding it the template I have used and giving it some background information like, this is my third attempt at contacting this candidate with no response and asking it to help me with more effective messaging to capture their attention.

AI: So it sounds like you're delegating that specific task - giving AI the context and letting it work on refining the message. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your recruiting work? Are others on your team approaching it similarly, or differently?

User: I would say there is not a huge push necessarily to utilize AI at my workplace, they let us manage our own recruiting process so long as it is productive, but the director has shared articles about a higher response rate when utilizing AI messaging and utilizing AI searches is a metric tracked in our kpi's.

AI: That's helpful context - so there's some measurement around AI search usage but flexibility in how you actually approach your work. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: We have a function in our Applicant Tracking System that ranks candidates using AI and assigns them a score on how well they think they will fit the job, but it bases it off the job description - not what our ideal candidate really is- so the candidates labeled the strongest are usually not a fit.  I do understand that this is mostly due to our unique hiring strategy, and could likely be remedied if we manipulated data to match what we are looking for on our end, but it does make me wonder if it could not learn from the candidate's resumes that are being hired what our ideal candidate is to provide better rankings.

AI: That sounds frustrating - having the AI ranking system work against your actual needs because it's based on standard job descriptions rather than your unique criteria. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your recruiting work?

User: This is definitely something I consider and am often concerned about with recruiting in general.  I can definitely see the sourcing aspect of identifying candidates being taken over by AI, but there will always be a need for assessing the soft skills of a person and identifying if they are a good culture fit. It would depend on individual hiring managers if they wanted to take on the task of having initial conversations based on AI recommended candidates or if it would still be beneficial to have a recruiter take the first pass.  Either way, I could definitely see AI creating a decrease in need of recruiters and sourcers.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on how AI might reshape your field. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use these tools over time?

User: Yes, it is inevitable that we will have to change and adapt with AI to stay relevant and successful in this field.  When I first started recruiting [REDACTED] years ago, we had to manually create Boolean strings in order to identify candidates, and I still do sometimes to get very specific results, but the advancements in our searching platforms have definitely made it easier to turn over every stone and case a wider net to ensure we are finding great talent.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in recruiting. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've maintained your manual search approach for those very specific candidate requirements, and your realistic view of how AI might reshape the recruiting field while recognizing the continued value of human assessment for soft skills and culture fit.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your recruiting work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I have enjoyed our conversation and thank you for your time!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about balancing AI capabilities with your specialized expertise, and your thoughtful perspective on the evolution of recruiting, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and limitations you've encountered. Have a great rest of your day!
