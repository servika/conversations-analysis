Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, sounds good. No questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Depending on the day and the task, the primary way I use AI is in software development and testing. This will include helping to debug logs, explain code, refactor code, extract and manipulate code snippets, brainstorm ideas on the best use of algorithms, design patterns, etc. 

Another common use case is in communication. Examples include rewriting emails for clarity, interpreted received messages that are unclear, or creating documentation from source material.

AI: That's really helpful - you're using AI across quite a range of technical and communication tasks. 

Tell me more about the debugging aspect. When you're working with logs or trying to debug an issue, how does that typically unfold with AI?

User: One example is when there's an error in the CI/CD pipeline. This is not an area I'm terribly familiar with, and the logs can be both exhaustive and opaque. Feeding the logs into LLMs and asking them to find the errors/failures and positing on the causes can often help me find the solution, or at least lead me in a promising direction.

AI: That sounds like AI is particularly valuable when you're working outside your core expertise. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If I had all the time in the world, I would prefer to explore ways of building a solution myself (minus the boilerplate code). For example, I enjoy crawling through a DOM to find the best ways of locating elements for E2E testing. I like doing this because it feels like a puzzle, and I get a dopamine hit when the selector works, like solving a puzzle.

AI: That's a great example - you get satisfaction from the puzzle-solving aspect of DOM crawling. It sounds like there's something about that discovery process that's rewarding for you.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Definitely collaborative. I don't like to simply delegate the entire task, because I like to understand not just what the model is doing but the reasons behind its choice.

AI: That collaborative approach makes sense given what you've shared about enjoying the puzzle-solving aspects.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Among my direct colleagues, I believe I use AI more than most. However, there's also a great deal of push from upper management (director level and above) to use AI in our daily work -- anything from simply increasing our productivity to discovering novel uses.

AI: Interesting - so you're ahead of the curve among your peers but you're also getting that organizational push from leadership. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: In a case of being satisfied, I did like how AI was able to pull together starting code to leverage the API for calls to various third party applications and sites. Sometimes the documentation for that is hard to find, but having AI take the first stab helps point me in the right direction.

In the case of being frustrated, there was a time when AI ran around in circles helping me to debug something, and it was making the code more and more convoluted in trying to fix the problem. When I looked at the problem more critically, I realized it was a simple mistake that had been coded in. Had I looked myself initially instead of asking AI to take the first look, it would have actually taken me less time.

AI: That's a really insightful contrast - AI excelling at giving you that initial direction with APIs, but getting you stuck in a loop when debugging. It sounds like that frustrating experience taught you something about when to step back and look at problems yourself first.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I actively consider it. Honestly, I'm not sure that "maintaining my skills" in direct competition with AI is the smart thing to do. Might be a fool's errand, because AI can already simulate critical thinking and produce results much faster than I can. I think what I should focus on is learning how to work with AI and harness its strengths, then applying in areas where human input is still valuable -- understanding the broader context, pulling in cross-domain knowledge that lives outside of where language systems can readily access, and steering the direction.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - focusing on partnership rather than competition and leveraging uniquely human strengths like cross-domain thinking and contextual understanding.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Exactly what I've said. I think that AI will increasingly take over the job of run-of-the-mill coding and testing. But I hope I can work within that framework and add human-centric strengths to round things out, resulting in something better than either AI or humans alone.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on focusing on partnership rather than competition with AI, and how you're thinking strategically about leveraging uniquely human strengths like cross-domain knowledge and contextual understanding.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of your AI interactions, the importance of understanding the reasoning behind AI's choices, and your strategic thinking about human-AI partnership will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
