Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use AI for the planning process of my work, especially in creating outlines and expanding on ideas in an outline. For example, I needed to plan out a posting schedule and content calendar for a new product and a niche I was unfamiliar with. AI helped me plan out an engaging schedule to help grow initial hype for the product.

AI: That sounds like AI is playing a strategic role in your content planning. Tell me more about that product launch project - what did that process look like when you were working with AI to create that posting schedule?

User: I just told the AI about the product, our target audience, and what social sites we would be posting on. With the schedule it created, it would give ideas for things such as what kind of videos we could make, what aspect of the product to focus on advertising, potential "meme" ideas, etc. As well as guidance for posting frequency and timing.

AI: That's a comprehensive approach. When you got that initial schedule and all those content ideas from the AI, what did you do next? Did you work with it further to refine things, or did you take what it gave you and run with it on your own?

User: A lot of ideas given I would use as a base to do deeper research into similar products and niches to better see what is actually working and not working. Basically, comparing real-world stuff to the ideas given by AI. From there, I would usually have a strong idea of where to take things with the product and do my own thing. Sometimes I would use AI for refinement, especially when it comes to copy and finding relevant hashtags.

AI: So it sounds like you use AI as a starting point, then validate those ideas against real-world data before moving forward. When you mention doing your "own thing" after that research phase - are there aspects of this content planning work that you specifically prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I enjoy the creative process a lot, and usually once I read an idea given to me by AI, my mind starts running a mile a minute on different ways I can expand on that idea. Since my specialty is graphic design and video, anything visual is usually really easy for me, and fun. AI let's me skip the not so fun stuff like creating a schedule.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI helps you bypass the parts of the work that feel more tedious so you can focus on what energizes you creatively. When you say your mind starts "running a mile a minute" after reading AI ideas, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How do those creative expansions typically unfold?

User: So, as an example, AI will mention presenting a product in a specific way that is engaging for the audience of our particular niche. For this example I'll go with underground subcultures. Immediately in my mind I have several ideas of fun compositions that I know will get people talking and sharing our product. I didn't even think about asking the AI for more details or ideas on compositions because I'm already gone and getting the photo shoot ready.

AI: I can really hear the excitement in how you describe that creative spark. It sounds like once AI gives you that initial concept, you're immediately visualizing and moving into execution mode. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you approach it similarly, or have you noticed different patterns?

User: I've noticed I'm the only one who seems to use AI in this way, and many times the only person at all who's using it in the first place. When others do use AI, it seems to only be at the end stages of an idea, which I think gives a weaker result. For example, someone might ask for copy for a vague idea of a newsletter they want to send out. I think if these people better planned out the newsletter in the first place, they would get stronger outcomes from the models.

AI: That's an interesting observation about timing and planning. When you see colleagues using AI for that final copy stage with vague ideas, what do you think is driving that approach? Is it a matter of not knowing how to use AI differently, or something else?

User: I think people, not just my colleagues, don't realize you get out exactly what you put into AI. If you ask for "newsletter copy for a new product launch", you're going to get basic copy for a basic prompt. The your of stuff that people can tell is obviously written by an AI. Meanwhile, if you put in more effort and include things like product details, target audience, company info, and even samples of previous newsletters so the AI can get an idea of the voice/tone to use in the writing, you're going to get a much, much stronger output.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the quality of input really shaping the quality of output. It sounds like you've developed a more sophisticated approach to prompting based on understanding how to get better results.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Seeing the results from the content schedule come to fruition was really satisfying. It proved that there really is something to all this AI "hype", and that it can be an amazing tool for productivity.

AI: That's a great example of validation through real results. What specifically about those results made you feel like the AI approach had really worked? Was it engagement numbers, conversions, or something else that showed you the strategy was successful?

User: Engagement numbers for sure, especially with getting people to sign up to our email newsletter. When selling any product, getting into people's emails is so important; the conversion rate for sales through social media is awful. It was very important for us to grab emails before the product launch to ensure strong sales on release day.

AI: That's a concrete measure of success - converting social media engagement into email subscriptions. It sounds like AI helped you build a funnel that actually worked for driving those pre-launch sign-ups.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well, as a designer supposedly AI has already taken my job, though it doesn't feel like it. It's controversial, but I think one should only fear AI if they're mediocre at what they do. As a designer, I've always put effort into learning new skills, new software, and new industries. Even before AI, the need to grow and evolve has always been important for job security, especially in such a overflowing career like design.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - viewing adaptation and growth as constants in your field rather than something new that AI introduced. It sounds like you see AI as just another tool in an evolving landscape.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: For now, I can only really see it as a tool for planning and productivity. I would like to see it somehow turn into a fully automated project management tool, as that would drastically streamline work even more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the quality of input determines the quality of output, and how you use AI strategically for the planning phase while keeping the creative execution for yourself.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a strategic planning tool while preserving the creative work you're passionate about, and especially your observations about how different prompting approaches lead to very different outcomes, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
