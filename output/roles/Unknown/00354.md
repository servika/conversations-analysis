Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes, sounds fine. Let's proceed.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use LLMs such as Chat GPT, Grok, Gemini, and Deepseek for my work. I use these models for organizing large amounts of data, sorting data, to help with finding information/research, for brainstorming ideas for my assignments. Most recently, I used Chat GPT to extract text from collected social media posts.

AI: That's a wide range of applications across different models. You mentioned extracting text from social media posts as a recent example - tell me more about that. What was that process like for you?

User: I had a large amount of social media posts collected from an assignment that I am working on (collecting various social media posts related to a specific political event). I needed the text extracted from the posts, along with like count, date, and the username/handle of the poster. Using AI for this saved me some time.

AI: That sounds like it was quite efficient for handling that volume of data. When you're working on assignments like this one, are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to write certain things myself, so that they sound more human (intros and conclusions). I like to come to conclusions myself as well. The AI can lead me/suggest direction, but ultimately I like to decide. I also have to be more cautious with sensitive information, so cannot use AI for assignments containing things like PII.

AI: That's really interesting - you draw clear boundaries around where you want your own voice and judgment to come through. When you do use AI for the tasks you're comfortable delegating, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: It depends on what kind of task I'm doing. For collaborative: editing writing (asking for phrasing suggestions to find what feels right, figuring out/working through what I'm trying to say) stress testing my arguments (considering counterpoints, the opposite case, conflicting evidence. I'm careful with letting it do tasks independently, and don't like to give it full tasks. AI is helpful for giving me a starting pool that I can filter. For example if I need suggestions for keyword searches on social media.4

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI as a starting point rather than the final word. You mentioned being careful about giving it full tasks independently. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: The group that I work with uses AI, and the lead of the group has encouraged AI usage so that it will speed up our work. We have to sift through a lot of online chatter, so AI is very helpful for that.

AI: It sounds like you have a supportive environment for AI use, which must make it easier to experiment with different approaches. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, it's frustrating when the model begins to forget or misremember things that were previously discussed in chat. If I have an assignment with a lot of details, I hope that I can rely on the AI to be an accurate memory bank to draw from. It makes me backtrack.

AI: That memory limitation sounds like it really disrupts your workflow, especially when you're dealing with complex assignments with many moving parts. On the flip side, has there been a time when using AI felt particularly satisfying or successful for you?

User: It's satisfying when the model has fully and correctly executed tasks such as extracting text from images, provided a perfect title for a paper, or come up with helpful suggestions that have helped me along with my work (historical parallels, finding specific legislation relating to something, finding somewhat niche research articles)

AI: Those examples really highlight where AI excels at finding connections and handling specific extraction tasks. As you continue working in this field where AI is clearly becoming more integrated, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that I need to maintain skills in assessing the meaning of things, because AI does not always get that right. I feel ahead by having an understanding of irony, sarcasm, and code/language common in specific alt spaces (my work is heavy on that). And with how things like that evolve online, I think that I'll be secure for a good while.

AI: That's a really astute observation about the nuanced understanding of context, subtext, and evolving online languages - those definitely seem like areas where human insight remains crucial. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I could see AI continuing to take on the energy heavy work so that I can spend more time on judgement calls, and finding more information. AI makes my background work much easier. I think that it'll help me do things more systematically.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining your edge through understanding irony, sarcasm, and evolving online language - that shows a really strategic way of thinking about which skills remain uniquely human.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Think we have covered it :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with human judgment, especially in areas requiring cultural and contextual understanding, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were about describing your workflow and the strategic way you think about which tasks to delegate versus retain. Have a great rest of your day!
