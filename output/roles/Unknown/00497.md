Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Should I call you Claud or Sonnett for our conversation?

AI: Just Claude works perfectly! That's what I go by.

Alright, let's dive in. Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically do not use AI during my everyday normal workday. There will be special instances where I need to develop a lesson plan, write documents, or create ideas for fun activities for my classes.

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like AI is more of a specialized tool for you rather than something woven into your daily routine. 

Tell me more about those special instances when you do reach for AI. What's happening that makes you think "this is a good time to use AI" for things like lesson planning or activity creation?

User: Usually it is for items that require a lot of leg work. Something I am perfectly capable of doing, but not nearly as fast. Usually when I want a slew of options for what to do during the day but don't want to spend 30+ minutes racking my brain. I also use it to help organize the flow of the lesson plan and make sure it proceedes smoothly and mindfully.

AI: So you're using it as a kind of efficiency multiplier - you could do the brainstorming and organizing yourself, but AI helps you get there much faster. 

When you say you use it to help organize the flow and make sure lessons proceed "smoothly and mindfully" - what does that collaboration look like? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth with the AI, or do you give it your rough thoughts and let it structure things for you?

User: I usually give it my thoughts about what I want roughly, get back their first version of ideas, then I tailor them from there to be more specific to what I would like to achieve. Most of the time it is phrased like, "Me: Hi AI, I would like you to create a lesson plan about A. AI: Sure! Here is XYZ about A. Me: Thanks, but could you make the second section a bit longer and take out the second to last section? Also, please include some kind of fun activity or game that I could relate to the lesson."

AI: That's a really clear picture of your process - it sounds like you use AI as a starting point generator, then you take control to shape it into what you actually need.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned these are tasks you're "perfectly capable of doing" yourself. Are there certain tasks where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the lesson planning ones?

User: I guess there are some tasks that I would rather handle myself, like creating creative stories. The AI I used so far tend to have the same kind of inauthentic, unnatural feel to it and I prefer the stretching of my creative muscles compared to mindless busywork. I also trust my vision far more than AI so anything that involves visual inspection I like to handle. I think those tasks are different because they still require or at least seem to benefit from human input. Also, does it sound to you like I am using the AI okay and to the fullest from what I have told you so far?

AI: I hear you asking about whether you're using AI "okay" - but I'm really interested in understanding your own perspective on that. What makes you wonder about whether you're using it to the fullest?

And going back to what you said about creative stories having that "inauthentic, unnatural feel" - that's a fascinating distinction you're making between tasks where you want to stretch your creative muscles versus what you called "mindless busywork." Tell me more about how you decide which category a task falls into.

User: Well, I am still not sure about the bounds of AI's capabilities, so I wanted input from the source about my usage. I decide categories distinction's based off of how much fun they appear to be. This is most likely a response to chemical production in my brain rewarding me for fun or productive behaviour that is not laborious or agonizing.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - using fun as your gauge for what you want to keep versus what feels like busywork worth delegating.

When you do use AI for those lesson planning tasks, can you walk me through what that interaction feels like for you? Are you sitting there going back and forth with it in real time, or do you tend to give it a task and then step away while it works?

User: It usually responds quite fast, but I will usually read a post or two while waiting for it to finish its answer. Usually I just switch between tabs since most of my work is on the computer.

AI: So it sounds pretty seamless - you're multitasking while it works, then coming back to review and refine.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it, or is it more something you've figured out on your own?

User: Unfortunately the majority of my peers are foagies who are limited or intimidated by technology. I am usually the one who is sharing information and new techniques or strategies for our job. I do not interact with coworkers too often however, it is mostly something I figured out on my own.

AI: So you're kind of the tech pioneer in your workplace - that's an interesting position to be in. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time when using AI made me feel particularly frustrated was when I was trying to get my class into Magic The Gathering for a class assignment but whenever I used the AI it responded with false information, bad recommendations, and hallucinations making it basically unusable for the activity. One time when it made me particularly satisfied was when I asked it to create poems where the first letter of each sentence spelled out student's names.

AI: That's such a stark contrast - the Magic The Gathering situation where it gave you unreliable information versus the name poems where it delivered exactly what you needed.

When you hit that frustration with the false information about Magic The Gathering, what did you do? Did you abandon using AI for that project, or did you try a different approach?

User: I tried using AI a few different ways, giving supporting documents, links, and corrections, but in the end it was more efficient to just navigate to an official MTG website instead. I have tried it again since then, but the results were still atrocious. Do you know why this would be?

AI: That's really interesting that even with supporting documents and corrections it still struggled with Magic The Gathering specifically. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given that you're kind of the tech-forward person in your workplace?

User: I do not consider maintaining skills AI could handle for me. I am more worried about the class war, impending war, and colonial-supported poverty that is affecting our nation currently. I am more worried about the unskilled lower classes that will be forgotten about and replaced with cheaper labor. I am more worried about the people who are profiting off of AI and perhaps not giving enough consideration to the consequenses of their profit-driven actions. I am not worried about AI potentially taking over,  just as I am not worried whether or not the sun will rise tomorrow.

AI: You're raising some really significant concerns about the broader societal impacts - the effects on different economic groups and the concentration of AI benefits. That's a much bigger picture view than just personal skill maintenance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself continuing with this same pattern of using it for specific efficiency tasks, or do you think that might change?

User: It might change as AI develops and bettes itself. Probably most likely.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using "fun" as your gauge for what tasks to keep versus delegate, and your broader concerns about AI's societal impacts beyond just personal use.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No or something similar.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an efficiency tool for the "busywork" while keeping the creative tasks for yourself, and your broader perspective on AI's societal implications, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your approach with me today.

User: No worries, take care and be sure to be mindful of the broad consequences of unchecked power and wealth.

AI: I will. Thank you for that important reminder, and take care as well.
