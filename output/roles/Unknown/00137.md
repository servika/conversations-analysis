Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hey Claude, that sounds good. Excited to get started! I have no questions right this minute.

AI: Great! I'm excited to hear about your experiences too.

Let's dive right in - could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So working in the police force, there currently aren't many official avenues where AI is in place, and of course it's not allowed in cases where sensitive personal information is handled, but I often use it when preparing for my workday, such as rehearsing conversations I'm going to be having with people. I often have to deal with tempers or highly emotional situations, or even where I have to work with someone who stays in their shell, so I never truly know what to expect each day, and AI keeps me prepared. I do sometimes use it for more menial tasks when I'm feeling lazy, but that's the main way I use it.

AI: That's fascinating - using AI to rehearse conversations for unpredictable human interactions sounds like a really thoughtful way to prepare. 

Tell me more about how you approach those conversation rehearsals. What does that process look like for you?

User: I give the AI a basic rundown of the most principle kind of elements of the situation I'll be dealing with, so this could be something like the age of the person or people (if I'm aware) - sometimes if I'm dealing with, say, a protest at a university, that gives me a general idea of ages, the gender, and the type of event or conflict that's ongoing. I tend to aim for two types of conversations: one where the AI is playing the other person or group, followed by an analysis/critique of my responses, and a conversation where we swap roles (mainly to focus on how the AI feels I should react). In both of these types of conversations I sometimes instruct it to throw in something unsuspected, like maybe an added time pressure or some kind of violent event so that I'm forced to think on the spot.

AI: That's a really sophisticated approach - having the AI both role-play scenarios and then analyze your responses. The idea of adding unexpected elements like time pressure or sudden complications is particularly interesting.

When you have the AI critique your responses, what kinds of feedback does it typically give you? What have you found most valuable in those analyses?

User: I do sometimes have problems with the AI seeming to give me critiques for no good reason (just because I ask for one, I don't think it necessary always needs to find one), but it typically tells me that I'm not being patient enough or seem like I'm trying to get the conversation over quickly. I am admittedly a fairly anxious person, so I try to keep these AI conversations realistic to my day to day. I mainly find these critiques helpful when it does outline a genuine concern, like if I've forgotten to ask the person something or forgotten to take an important step when starting out the roleplay, such as failing to address the person in a certain way or, for example, imposing myself too much on a person who's likely to be nervous, especially around the police.

AI: It sounds like you've developed a good sense of when the AI's feedback is genuinely useful versus when it might just be generating critique for the sake of it. The specific examples you mentioned - like remembering to address someone appropriately or being mindful of how your presence as a police officer might affect someone who's already nervous - those seem like really important nuances for your work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I definitely don't use AI (and am extra cautious to not have it on my history) when dealing with personal data, like I mentioned earlier. I do imagine AI to be incorporated more among the force within the next decade or so but there is not enough known about it for it to be trusted, so I don't delegate it to involve itself in a huge number of tasks. I also wouldn't use it for writing reports, since my writing skills are fairly sound and I imagine that it wouldn't be able to provide nuance. But I do regularly use AI for things like checking my spelling and providing a critique of my reports, e.g. if I missed something out or should omit something (I also give it a heavily, roughly-written list of what I've done or experienced that day based on the notepad I write in daily while working). I feel I can trust it more for those kinds of tasks and shouldn't get any reprimand for it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that clear boundary around sensitive information while still finding ways to leverage AI for preparation and review tasks. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot using it for spelling checks and getting feedback on whether you've covered everything in your reports.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: In this kind of scenario (like report writing), I prefer to have completely written it up myself before consulting the AI. The exception would be if I'm really struggling for ideas, as I don't think I'm a hugely expressive and creative person. For example, we are sometimes made to complete exercises during training where we are made to think of situations and how we would act in them. When I know I have one of these coming up, I try to get the AI to generate ideas for me. I do collaborate with it regularly in those cases, but for the more common report writing I suppose it's a little more independent, since I just need it to make quick checks or suggestions. If the ideas are bad I might refresh its response, or if the ideas are still bad or it gets stuck for whatever reason, I might collaborate with it more so we get back on track.

AI: That's really interesting how you adapt your approach based on what you're working on. It sounds like for creative exercises you're more collaborative from the start, but for reports you maintain full ownership of the initial writing and then bring AI in as a reviewer.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I suppose over the past year I've spoken to more colleagues about the increase in AI, or heard rumours of how it might be integrated/what aspects might be forbidden, so there's both concern over using it and increasing acceptance of it. I have a couple of people on my team who also use it for report writing; it was actually one of those colleagues who got me onto doing it myself.

AI: It sounds like there's a bit of a shift happening - moving from concern toward more acceptance, especially as people see practical applications like report writing. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There are usually times where it's satisfied (or mostly satisfied) me, but I suppose a particularly frustrating time was when I was told I would need to deal with a complex scenario involving a protest group that were extremely popular but had just been considered an illegal organisation. I knew that there would be an overwhelming amount of people to deal with and was struggling for ideas on how to handle the situation and how to respond to those who might come up to me. I didn't have a lot of time to prepare with the AI for this and its ideas generally weren't relevant to what happened on the day, so I ultimately felt very unprepared, or like I'd prepared for the wrong kinds of things.

AI: That sounds really challenging - especially when you're counting on that preparation and then the actual situation unfolds completely differently than what you and the AI anticipated. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It worries me sometimes I suppose, like it taking over boring but easy tasks, and having to take on a tougher workload. I don't worry too often about losing things like my writing skills which come naturally, but I am concerned that AI would completely take over something like this, where my skills are most on point. I feel like it's less trusted to take on things like accounts/mathematics where my skills are less sharp, so while it can be useful for that kind of thing, I worry that I'll be pushed more into areas where my skills are not that great.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern - the possibility that AI might handle the areas where you're strongest while leaving you with tasks that don't play to your strengths. It's almost like a reverse of what you'd want to happen.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As AI improves, I expect it (particularly when using it for roleplaying scenarios) to hopefully develop into more natural discussions. Maybe even realistic audible or visual conversations rather than just the typical text-based discussions I usually have. That would help me prepare more, I think. Like I said earlier I can also see it becoming more commonplace in the workplace generally for a lot of small-scale tasks, freeing up the workload for a lot of us on the force but probably also forcing us to take on more work in other areas, so I could envision the job becoming even more physical than it currently is, since that isn't really an area AI can currently touch.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed such a structured approach to using AI for scenario rehearsals, and your honest reflections about the potential shifts in what kinds of work you might end up doing as AI capabilities evolve.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thanks for the discussion though. Happy to wrap up now!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for preparation and training scenarios, navigating workplace boundaries around sensitive information, and thinking through the evolving balance of human and AI capabilities will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the concerns. Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
