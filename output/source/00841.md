Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great, let's do it!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: When working as a writer, I will use AI to quickly research a breadth of topics and provide relevant articles. I was doing some research on the Balkans crisis of the 90s, and used ChatGPT 5's Thinking Model to do research, and it created an in-depth syllabus with relevant guiding readings. My day job is a teacher, and I will also use AI to create/format lesson plans, create activities where random sorting is necessary, use it to create things like bingo cards, all of which are normally tedious and distract me from the important work of connecting with students.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI in two very different professional contexts. It sounds like you're leveraging it for both the research-heavy aspects of writing and the administrative tasks in teaching.

When you mention that these tasks "distract from the important work of connecting with students," that suggests you have a clear sense of what you want to keep for yourself versus what you're comfortable delegating. Are there certain tasks in either your writing or teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them?

User: I'd prefer to keep creative and critical thinking tasks to myself. I also prefer to do my own writing, and not delegate that to AI. These skills are important to me for a number of reasons, and I do not want/need AI to do them for me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense. It sounds like you have a clear boundary between the tasks you see as core to your professional identity and the more administrative or preparatory work.

When you do use AI for those research and administrative tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: More likely to delegate. Collaborative tasks are things I choose to do with coworkers.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - keeping collaboration for your human colleagues. So when you delegate to AI, like with that Balkans research syllabus or creating bingo cards, you're essentially handing off the complete task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people around you using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: AI is a huge taboo in education right now, specifically students' use of AI in assignments. Teachers definitely use for task delegation, but the act of teaching in front of a classroom cannot be replaced by an AI chatbot. The issue lies in students using AI to complete standard-driven tasks, as in, state standards would require a student performs a certain task, and the student uses AI to show they adhere to that standard. Teachers seem to be using it similarly, if at all.

AI: That's really insightful - there's this tension where AI is seen as problematic when students use it for the very tasks they're supposed to be learning, but teachers like yourself are using it for different purposes entirely.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Not certain I've been frustrated by it too many times, because I try to be as clear and direct as possible, and remind myself that the AI is only as smart as what I input.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - taking responsibility for the input quality to get better outputs. It sounds like you've developed a practical mindset about working with AI.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think an AI chatbot (as they exist currently) could effectively replace the human interactions that constitute a healthy learning community. I certainly try to sharpen my ability to respond to student work, but I don't think any students would desire a classroom taught by an emotionless chatbot.

AI: That's a compelling point about the irreplaceable human elements of teaching. You clearly see AI as handling the behind-the-scenes work while you focus on those meaningful interactions.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Continue to use it for task delegation. I can't imagine using it to think critically for me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear perspective on maintaining that boundary between human-centered work like teaching and student connection versus the administrative tasks that can be delegated.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing else!
