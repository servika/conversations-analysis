Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I am ready to start

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as an operations coordinator for a in-house creative services team. We produce videos and events for different non profits. I do a lot of our organizing, so I mainly use chat gpt to polish up what I am already creating  - think everything from emails to production schedules. I'm also using it to do research - about potential interviews and also some of the more techinical elements that go into a production shoot.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of tasks. 

When you say you use it to "polish up" things like emails and production schedules, what does that process typically look like for you? Are you writing a draft first and then asking AI to refine it, or is there another way you approach that?

User: I use it across the board - to help me polish each step of the way. In the very basic form, I do a mind dump, where I talk about everything i am doing for 5 - 10 minutes and then have it create a summary that i can use or share with the team. I also use it to make excel and google sheets look nicer, whether thats asking about specific formulas or advice on how to organize. And then i often send a short email and ask for it to make it formal when sending to a third party.

AI: That mind dump approach sounds really useful - basically using AI to help organize your thoughts into something shareable. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: That's interesting. I had a crazy interaction where I was coordinating an interview with a CEO, I had to cancel and reschedule a couple times, I when I finally got him on the phone, I thanked his assistant for being so accomidating with my many requests. He said that he doesn't have an assistant, but rather developed an AI that acts like one through his email. I was suprised, but realized that I too would like to outsource the gritty back and forth of scheduling to maximize the meaningful conversations. I enjoy working with other people. I enjoy learning new things. I don't want to give those up.

AI: That's a fascinating story - and it really highlights how AI is already being integrated in ways we might not even realize. It sounds like that experience helped clarify something important for you about what you value in your work.

When you say you enjoy working with other people and learning new things, and don't want to give those up - can you tell me more about what specifically makes those parts of your work meaningful to you?

User: For me learning equals participation. So I want to go to shows and learn how things work, how to build out a show and then how to work with staff to successfully execute it. I like the teamwork that comes with a creative team trying to solve a problem together. I like the brainstorming about a new way to do things with people.

AI: That really comes through - the hands-on learning and collaborative problem-solving seem central to what energizes you at work.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Right now, I am much more likely to delegate. I like to adjust course as I go, so even in research, I often email people who have a lot of information available online. Like CEOs and founders of fortune 500 companies. I would much rather have a conversational research (with deep research capability, where it can take its time to reason) with a chatbot, than just one comprehensive deep research report.  I'm looking for things about their childhood and where they were raised and their first jobs. These details usually come through watching and listening to interviews, and I find it helpful to find more nuanced, new ideas, than a comprehensive view of all the ideas.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you're looking for those deeper, more nuanced details that emerge through conversation rather than a broad overview. It sounds like you value that back-and-forth discovery process even when working with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We are started to use AI in two very distinct ways. In one area it's very professional, where we spend a lot of money and time creating high end videos based on the top of the line AI available. This allows us to add in some archival scenes that were just not available in our current assets.

AI: That sounds like a significant professional investment in AI technology for your video production. You mentioned there are two very distinct ways your team uses AI - you described the high-end video production side. What's the other way your workplace is incorporating AI?

User: The other is very simple. People who print out idea lists that don't quite make sense for a project, that you can tell are a more basic AI not an expert. I work in the middle.

AI: That's a really interesting spectrum - from high-end, expensive AI for professional video production to more basic AI-generated lists that don't quite hit the mark. It sounds like you've found your sweet spot somewhere between those extremes.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I really like using it to polish up some emails. I am one of those people who can get anxiety when sending an email to a Exec or VIP. I often find myself wasting a lot of time rereading an email and switching one word back and forth a couple times. Using a chat bot, gives me a quick final product, that i just quickly proof read and send. It takes the anxiety out of it for me. And then i often get frustrated when it can't create what i want, sometimes it feels like a spinning wheel that just isn't moving forward. Or when it hullacinates when i do research.

AI: That contrast is really striking - the relief it provides with email anxiety versus the frustration when it gets stuck or provides inaccurate information. The email example sounds like it's solving a very specific problem for you beyond just the writing itself.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not worried about it. My skills are about working with people, solving problems for people, and building events. I think AI will come and ruin the quality of a lot of things - loose personal creativity and make events and videos all feel generic, and people who are awful will work with it and make your life awful, but that happens anyways. My job will be about solving the problems that arise within it.

AI: That's such a grounded perspective - seeing AI as a tool that will create new challenges to solve rather than something that will replace what you fundamentally bring to your work. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think my relationship with AI will become more seamless. Now I use a personal account and only use it independently. Soon I think it will be part of all our systems, like we use email and microsoft word and excel, we will have AI built in email responses, AI summaries of documents, AI prebuilt excel templates.  It will be about tweaking and changing (but that is a lot of what we currently do know, just with more seams)

AI: That vision of AI becoming more integrated into existing tools rather than being a separate thing you go to makes a lot of sense. The idea that it will feel more seamless but still require that human touch of "tweaking and changing" really aligns with how you've described your current approach.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with email anxiety while still valuing the human elements of collaboration and problem-solving.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that middle ground between high-end and basic AI use, and how you think about AI as creating new problems to solve rather than replacing human skills, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
