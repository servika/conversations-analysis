Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes sounds good, let's start!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am an assistant audio engineer at a recording studio. The majority of the work I do involves recording musicians, and mixing/mastering records after the fact.

AI: That sounds like fascinating work! I'd love to understand more about how AI might fit into what you do.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: The past couple of years there have been a number of AI audio tools that have hit the market. One I have been using just today is a 'stem splitter' called SpectraLayers. There are a number of tools now that are able to create individual audio files for the different instruments in a recording even if you only have a single stereo file to begin with. There can be artifacts, and inconsistencies but it has been improving consistently over time. This used to be a simply impossible task prior to AI. You could try to EQ a recording to isolate a single instrument but it would always be nowhere close to the level achievable now. There are also AI tools by a company called Izotope that do a great job at analyzing audio and removing buzzes, hums, clicks, noise and reverb. I also use ChatGPT in my day to day in a few situations.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is solving some problems that were previously just impossible to tackle. Tell me more about how you use ChatGPT in your day-to-day work.

User: It tends to be my first resource when I am looking for information on a piece of gear, or for a creative solution to a signal flow issue I'm running into. For example I have been researching getting a footswitch to integrate into the talkback system of our console. I used chatgpt to find possible products, and ask how that could be achieved or if there are any easier ways to achieve the job. Also, I tend to use ChatGPT a lot for planning tasks, so planning sessions or setting up schedules i use it for. Finally while writing a piece it will sometimes come out to help someone come up with a rhyme or some inspiration for lyrics

AI: It sounds like ChatGPT has become a really versatile tool for you across different aspects of your work. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Is that including the audio AI tools?

AI: Yes, absolutely - any AI tools you've used. I'm interested in hearing about whichever example feels most meaningful or interesting to you, whether that's the audio AI tools or ChatGPT.

User: Today I have been tasked with trying to take a rough single recording of a live performance of a few bands and split the audio into several different tracks and try my best to make it salvageable so that it can be mixed in the future. This task would have been all but impossible without the tool I am using. We pretty much would have been forced to just use the recording as is but now, I can split the instruments and apply separate processing and levels to each piece of the band to make it sound passable. It feels great to be able to use a recording that was not ideal in the first place. A lot of times in the past when you would mess up during the recording process you were just screwed, either rerecord or accept the bad sound, but now nearly anything is salvageable.

AI: That's a powerful example - it really sounds like AI has fundamentally changed what's possible with audio that would have been written off before. When you're working with these AI tools on a project like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Specifically with the AI splitting I am definitely the one making the decisions. There is not much opportunity for the program to have any creative input into the process. It is simply taking the existing material and changing it into a more usable form for me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the AI is more like a powerful tool than a creative collaborator in that context. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It has allowed me to focus more on the fun, rewarding parts of the job, as the more tedious and monotonous elements are becoming easier to automate.

AI: That's a great way to put it. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do have quite a few concerns. These types of tools are great but the generative AI that can create songs out of thin air worry me a lot. I have read that huge amounts of the songs being posted daily now are likely completely AI generated and it just makes idea of trying to become a profitable artist even more difficult which means less people needing to record. The tools can be used to automate small pieces of the puzzle but as soon as the AI is making the song for you, it really defeats the purpose. I saw a tech CEO of I think, Suno saying that no one really wants to spend all that time getting good and making music themselves. It's just crazy how out of touch with reality that sentiment is. Making the art is the most important part. And as soon as it can make the art for you, there will be millions using it and trying to profit by any means necessary with their generated art.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - between AI as a tool that enhances your creative process versus AI that replaces the creative act itself. It sounds like you see a fundamental difference between using AI to solve technical problems and using it to generate the actual artistic content.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Yes, sadly I don't know if it will be for the better. As I said the tools that currently exist are in a good place where they mostly help the process without doing the work for you. It feels like the people creating this technology want the ai to do the work for you. which worries me, people create things because it is fulfillingh not because they really want to hear a song in 5 mins.

AI: Those are really insightful perspectives you've shared. You've painted a clear picture of how AI can enhance the technical side of your work in meaningful ways, while also highlighting some deep concerns about where the technology might be headed.

I particularly appreciated your distinction between AI tools that help you focus on the rewarding parts of your job versus those that might replace the fulfilling creative act itself. Your point about people creating music because the process is fulfilling, not just for the end result, really resonates.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the difference between AI as a creative tool versus AI as a replacement for creativity have been incredibly valuable, and your perspective on how these technologies are affecting both the technical and human sides of music production will be really helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
