Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use AI to help me when I'm stumped trying to mix things up with a new menu. I usually ask for recipes that are specialized to my needs and current ingredients, like vegan/vegetarian,  "superfood" recipes, stuff that appeal to healthy crowds but taste good, sit well on a buffet bar. I also ask about food substitutes when i'm out of stuff

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're working in food service or catering. When you say you use AI when you're "stumped," can you walk me through what that moment looks like? What's happening that makes you decide to reach out to AI for help?

User: I curate a daily menu at my work for a health food crowd that often has many allergies. I struggle to find new recipes that fit that mindset as I'm not that kind of person (classic southern eats cook). After doing it for so long, it feels hard to find new and exciting recipes so I ask AI for suggestions a few times a week or less when I start my prep for the next day(s).

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're bridging two very different food cultures. When you do reach out to AI for those recipe suggestions, what does that interaction typically look like? Do you give it a detailed brief about what you need, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation where you refine the ideas together?

User: Little of both. It depends if I need something more specific (fresh veggies, won't dry out on hot bar, Asian meal, no dairy, greens only, no sesame) where I will work with the AI across a conversation or when it's more general and I just want ideas (some general main proteins, no chicken, won't dry out on hot bar)

AI: That's really interesting how you adapt your approach based on the complexity of what you need. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I don't typically ask for cleaning suggestions, like best way to degrease an oven quickly even though there are probably way better ways that how i do it or few ways to make my own spice mixes, as I prefer to look up recipes myself

AI: That's intriguing - so you draw a line between recipe creation and these more hands-on operational tasks. What is it about cleaning techniques or spice mixing that makes you want to handle those yourself rather than asking AI?

User: I trust that people who have tested spice mixes know better than a computer. I also don't feel like asking for help when cleaning, not necessary for AI help. I could also ask help for curating my employee schedule or to keep a memory of the amount of items I typically order for the truck week to week, but I just don't. I don't trust that the memory is always most functional (tends to forget things) and I don't really don't trust that the models can handle a complex task such as organizing an employee schedule, which would require more work from me than would benefit me. From my experience with similar complex tasks, I would spend time inputting all of this data, double-checking the models work, and then have to do everything myself  anyways because it would be wrong.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making. It sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where AI adds value versus where it creates more work. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have been really frustrated trying to find vegetarian dishes that are both exciting and suit my needs. For my daily menus, I often have a theme. I have vegetables that I will usually make with it, some I am usually asking for NEW and DIFFERENT vegetable dishes that are vegan, "fresh" (al dente per vegetable), and easy to maintain in a buffet hot bar (hotel pan over a steamed buffet). For instance, I was once looking for this but without zucchini/yellow squash or carrots as the main item (mixed in okay as long as it wasn't a lot of said vegetable; I had two other dishes that were these items). It needed to be free of common allergens, theme was just classic comforts (but healthy, as per our store). The model consistently outputted some form of heavily spiced vegetable (not good for a southern dish), a squash (after I asked for less squash suggestions), or something that was containing dairy. The conversation continued to a point that the model would forget previous instructions and I ended it without receiving the help I needed.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you're trying to meet so many specific constraints at once and the AI keeps circling back to suggestions you've already ruled out. When you say the model would "forget previous instructions," what did that look like? Did it start suggesting things from earlier in the conversation that you'd already said wouldn't work?

User: At a point long into the conversation, I would ask it to try again, in addition to whatever new constraint or RESTATED constraint (just me reminding the model). It would output a new recipe following this new/same instruction, BUT include brown butter or it would be a stewed vegetable (both items that I had ruled out). It would try to follow what I had recently stated and not very earlier previously stated. This would be despite me saying "in addition to all prior constraints."

AI: That must have been really maddening - having to constantly remind it of things you'd already established. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do they use it too, or are you pretty much on your own with it?

User: Not really, most of the individuals I work with are unfamiliar with AI (older crowd). Also, for many positions, the work is hands-on and repetitive, which doesn't require AI or technological assistance.

AI: So you're pretty much pioneering this on your own. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really, as a cook I'm not worried about AI taking over these tasks. I'd love if we had the option for AI to take over all customer assistance, but it's not likely.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - you see AI as potentially helpful for customer service but not a threat to your cooking skills. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll use it more, differently, or about the same?

User: I might start evolving to ask about new cooking techniques for the equipment I have, a sort of evolution to asking for new recipes. Maybe slightly more often.

AI: That makes sense - expanding from recipes to techniques seems like a natural next step. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed clear boundaries around what tasks are worth AI's help versus where it creates more friction than value.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI's strengths and limitations in a specialized field like yours - especially dealing with complex constraints and the challenge of maintaining context in longer conversations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your experiences today!
