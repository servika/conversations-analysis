Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions -- sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: What specifics are of interest to you in this, given that that's a very broad question?

AI: You're absolutely right - let me be more specific about what I'm looking for. 

I'm interested in understanding the stages you went through and the types of tasks involved. For example, how you came up with the research question, what methods you used to investigate it, how you analyzed your data, and how you shared your findings. 

Just pick any recent project and walk me through those key steps - it doesn't need to be exhaustive, but enough detail so I can understand your typical workflow.

User: Ah okay.  My research was in the field of graphical category theory.  My supervisor had recently done an in-depth study of how to represent functor boxes graphically.  So, I was trying to find ways of extending this.  I looked at some kinds of categories that people are often interested in, and I decided to look at Topoi.  The research from there was looking at ways to visually encode the required data in the graphical format.  This took quite a long time, trying various things, until eventually, after looking at much of the pre-existing research, I was able to come up with a nice way of encoding it all.  From there, I focused on proving some facts about topoi graphically, which was essentially me just examining pre-existing proofs, and seeing how the graphical calculus could simplify them.

AI: That's fascinating - so you went from extending your supervisor's work on functor boxes, to focusing specifically on topoi, then developing the visual encoding methods, and finally applying that to simplify existing proofs.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I tried to experiment with AIs at many stages in the process, but as I was in interested in visual reasoning, they weren't really that useful.  At the end, I tried to get AIs to proof-read the final Latex document, for example -- which meant there were quite a few mistakes that the AI made, as it was not able to correctly examine the visual proofs.  I also asked it for literature reviews, to look at the existing graphical category theory literature, as well as that of topoi.  I even asked it to try and prove some things in normal categorical style, where there were things I didn't understand in the literature.  This was somewhat successful, but often there were mistakes in the given proofs.

AI: Tell me more about that experience with the literature reviews - how did that work out for you compared to doing your own literature search?

User: I found using the AI helpful and much faster than looking for things myself.  Particularly as topos theory is a relatively old field, meaning that many sources can be hidden away from being freely available on the internet, and so the fact that AI has often read these sources, meant it could identify them and reccommend them to me.

AI: That's really helpful context - so the AI was able to point you toward sources that might have been harder to discover through traditional search methods.

For the literature review task where AI was helpful, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach of searching yourself.

User: Well as the AI was always quick and easy to use, I would always ask that first, and then double check sources, and if needed, I would look at things myself in more detail.

AI: So you developed a workflow where AI became your first step - that makes sense given the speed advantage you mentioned.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like developing those visual encoding methods for topoi - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Well from what I've seen AI cannot reliably generate mathematical diagrams, and also struggles with visual reasoning.  So it would be essentially useless in these domains, where that is entirely what's required.

AI: That's a clear limitation - visual reasoning being core to your work but outside AI's current capabilities.

When you did use AI for things like literature reviews or proof attempts, how do you verify or validate what it produces? You mentioned double-checking sources, but tell me more about your process there.

User: Well for proofs, I can read the proof and verify the correctness by reading and trying to understand, as is usual in mathematical research.  In terms of literature reviews, I was usually looking for something specific, so checking the existence of the thing in the literature given a source is trivial.

AI: That makes sense - you can apply your existing mathematical expertise to verify the proofs and check whether sources actually contain what you're looking for.

We're about two-thirds of the way through our conversation now. Here's my last main question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: It would definitely be the ability to reason diagrammatically and produce mathematically rigorous diagrams.

AI: That's really clear - it sounds like visual diagram generation and reasoning would unlock AI's potential for the core parts of your work that are currently off-limits.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on how AI fits as a first-pass tool for literature work while being limited by visual reasoning capabilities were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No -- that's all; thank you.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can serve as a valuable starting point for literature discovery - especially for accessing older, less readily available sources - while being fundamentally limited by visual reasoning capabilities really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real mathematical research work.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day!
