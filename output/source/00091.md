Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes this sounds good. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My role in my day job is a delivery manager, working with internal development teams, external vendors and general operations teams. 
This means my use of AI does vary on a day to day basis but includes using AI for capturing and summarising meetings and actions for sessions such as project standups, creating templates for documentation such as business requirements, statements of work, project documentation, rewriting emails to better capture intent or change communication style. 

In addition to this, I'm also responsible for some of our digital platforms which involves developing and maintaining front and back end for our web applications. I use AI regularly to help develop solutions for new tools and pages, and help maintain the platform by troubleshooting any bugs etc that may present.

AI: That's a really diverse range of uses across both management and technical work. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Alot of the work I am involved in is industry specific or requires specific business context that AI cannot assist with. Because of this I will typically start with using AI as a template or providing a foundation and then will adjust or complete to fit the needs of our business. This occurs across of all of the tasks mentioned above, for example, with meeting notes there is terminology, acronyms etc that is bespoke to our business and requires adjustment. Another example with code is having a very specific use case to our industry, so providing AI with the technical context and then applying the specific business and industry context after the fact.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a foundation and then layering in that specialized knowledge. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Typically I will collaborate with AI at the beginning / middle of the task then complete the task independently. This allows for a thorough review of the output and ensures it has been appropriately reviewed before it is completed. I have not yet found many use cases where I would delegate AI to completely handle a task independently.

AI: That's an interesting collaborative approach - bringing AI in for the initial or middle phases but keeping that final review and completion under your control.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Our workplace has applied a specific policy and preference on which tools we are allowed to use within the business. However, we have an internal group / culture that is established to enable us to share ideas on how we use these tools so we can learn from each other. This has allowed us all to learn new things and get some efficencies in our day to day work.

AI: That sounds like a really supportive environment - having both clear guidelines and a community for sharing best practices.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One example I have found really useful is creating specific data samples or data sets for testing of software applications or integrations. This is something that has always been a painpoint as it takes a lot of time and AI has made it almost effortless. 

One frustration I have is where I have used AI to rewrite specific documentation or emails to fit a better communication style but in the process has completely removed the context as part of the solution. It was a lesson that I always need to validate the output and double check if I am using this type of feature.

AI: Those are great examples - the contrast between that effortless data generation versus losing important context in communications really highlights the variability in AI's effectiveness.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: While I see a risk that AI can replace skillsets for the likes of coding and data administration, the same tool provides skills and learning to become advanced in these areas or enable to create something better than what you would have without it. Therefore I see AI as an enabler of being able to be better at the existing skill sets to come up with a better output, and therefore put the time in to learn how to use these AI tools to provide even more value.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - viewing AI as a skill amplifier rather than a replacement. It sounds like you're actively investing in learning how to leverage these tools effectively.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it being more of the same but hoping as the tools become smarter and integrate into more of our technologies, being able to leverage these tools more to add even more value to our workplace.

AI: That makes sense - deeper integration and smarter tools leading to even greater value creation.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a skill amplifier and your systematic approach of collaborating early in tasks but maintaining control over the final output.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope thats all thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a foundation while layering in business-specific context, and your view of AI as a skill amplifier rather than a replacement, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
