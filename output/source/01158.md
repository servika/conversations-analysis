Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me, thanks!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My typical projects involve creative writing in either poetry or creative nonfiction. For poetry, I've developed a generative system that helps me produce a large amount of work quickly and access my subconscious more easily. For creative nonfiction, I write in fragments of memories and then try to loop them together into a narrative, which I often find quite tricky. When I worked in an art museum, I used AI to help me write the paragraphs next to the painting at a tenth-grade reading level. I would conduct the research, decide on the structure, and then ensure it was accessible to an audience at a tenth-grade reading level through AI.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across quite different types of creative work. Tell me more about this generative system you've developed for poetry. How does that actually work in practice?

User: Ha, there's a number of steps. 1. Meditate. 2. Take a piece of paper and draw a line down the middle. 3. On one side of the paper, write a word, it doesn't matter which word, any word. On the other side, write another random word. 4. Start with the first column and write as quickly as you can whatever you associate with the chosen word. Repeat on the second column. 5. Once the associations have filled the page, try to find connections across the columns that can make interesting lines, sentences, or phrases. 6. Write these lines down on a separate piece of paper. 7. Cut out all of the lines into strips of paper and arrange them on your floor. 8. If you've already been doing this, you should have more lines already arranged on your floor. Sit, stare, and move around the pieces of paper until the structure of a poem begins to appear. Repeat as necessary. 9. Write your first draft of the poem from the pieces of paper. 10. Write a refined draft of the poem.

AI: That's a really detailed and methodical process - I can see how that would help access different layers of your thinking. Where does AI come into this generative system you've described? I'm curious about how it fits into those ten steps.

User: I've primarily used AI for my creative nonfiction and bridging gaps between memories. Narrative is difficult for me and I prefer fragments, as you can see in my poetry process. I suppose AI could fit into the poetry process by helping me see connections between the columns that I might have missed. Further, when a batch of first drafts are written, I suppose AI could help me dientify "poetic obsessions" or recurring themes within them.

AI: That's really interesting - so for your creative nonfiction, you mentioned AI helps bridge gaps between memory fragments. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as a writer?

User: I'm working on a memoir about mortality and the loss of a lot of loved ones to suicides and overdoses throughout my twenties. Obviously, trauma creates fragmented memories. Further, the most beautiful moments are split seconds, or a few minutes, and don't really fit into a cohesive narrative. I've worked on ways to bridge this gap, but AI could certainly help me identify those gaps or consider other structures that would suit my style as it is.

AI: That sounds like deeply personal and important work. When you say AI could help identify gaps or consider other structures - have you actually tried this yet with your memoir, or is this something you're thinking about exploring? I'm curious about what your actual experience has been like when AI has helped with this kind of narrative work.

User: I've tried it a little bit to help me bridge gaps, and I've found it helpful, but it just doesn't change that I don't really think in terms of narrative, so it doesn't make the work of changing it into something that's not naturally any more pleasant. I have not yet used it to help me brainstorm other structures.

AI: That's such an honest insight - that even when AI helps technically, it doesn't change your fundamental way of thinking or make the work feel more natural to you. When you have used AI to help bridge those gaps, how would you describe that collaboration? Who's driving the creative decisions in those moments?

User: I'm driving the creative decisions, and I wouldn't want it any other way. However, I think AI sometimes struggles to identify my voice, which is very image-based and also linguistically idiosyncratic. So, when it gives me ideas, they're often the most pared-down, simple version of what I'm trying to say, and I have to rewrite them to make them sound like me. Perhaps this is a good thing because it reiterates my responsibility to my creative work, but it would also feel nice to feel like I have more of a workshop partner who can identify my stylistic goals.

AI: That's a really nuanced observation - you want to maintain creative control but also feel like you have a partner who truly understands your voice and style. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI, beyond just the technical assistance with bridging gaps?

User: That's a difficult question to answer because I've taken a much-needed pause from both my book and poetry because I burned myself out creatively. Right now, I focus on journaling and observing, and who knows, maybe that will enter these projects. If AI could learn to read my horrible handwriting, maybe it could help organize my very fragmented journal entries.

AI: It sounds like you're in a thoughtful reflective period right now. Given your experiences so far - both the helpful aspects and the limitations you've described - what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in creative writing and your field more broadly?

User: Well, here's the paradox. Right now, AI writes primarily one-size-fits-all agreeable work, and when asked to imitate a writer such as James Joyce, it absolutely fails to. I think, on one hand, this is a good thing because it puts higher value on more idiosyncratic writers than there are at present. Lots of humans write one-size-fits-all books, but I feel that in the next five to ten years, that will become less acceptable, whether written by humans or AI. However, as I mentioned, it would be ideal if AI could become my creative partner and understand my goals sufficiently to help me maintain my voice throughout the editing process. I think that the highest benefit of it could be to get the work polished enough to submit to agents and publishers.

AI: That's a fascinating paradox you've identified - AI potentially making distinctive voices more valuable while also having the potential to become a better creative partner for developing those unique voices. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years, especially as you potentially return to your book and poetry projects?

User: As I have this conversation, I may experiment with uploading my poetry chapbook and seeing where it might not land with readers. It's based on my getting robbed at gunpoint and the experiences afterwards. However, I find AI can be too validating (wow! this is great! it should be published right now!) when that's not the reality of responses from agents and poetry contests. Perhaps if it had more knowledge of successful books and could identify the threads through them, it would help me get a better grasp on what's being looked for in recent contests and publishing deals.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might make idiosyncratic voices more valuable while also the challenge of finding that balance between helpful assistance and maintaining your authentic voice.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the paradoxes and nuances of working with AI as a creative writer - from the challenge of maintaining your distinctive voice to the potential for AI to help navigate the publishing landscape - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty about both the possibilities and limitations you've encountered. Best of luck with your creative work, whether that's continuing with journaling and observation or eventually returning to your memoir and poetry projects.
