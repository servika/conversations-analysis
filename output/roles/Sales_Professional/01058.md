Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good to you?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI to help with some creative/template style writing for things like writing descriptive sales listings for Ebay, drafting responses to customer questions or issues, or sourcing product information to use in my item listings. I also sometimes use AI to analyze data/statistics and provide suggestions on how to improve traffic or sales.

AI: That's a nice range of uses. When you're working on those sales listings or customer responses, how do you typically approach the process? Do you find yourself going back and forth with AI to refine the content, or do you usually get what you need in one go?

User: I usually have to go back and fourth to refine the content unless the topic/subect/issue is very simple or I input VERY specific and detailed information to begin with.

AI: Tell me more about what that back-and-forth process looks like for you. What kinds of adjustments are you typically making?

User: For example, if I am creating a sales listing description for an item, unless specifically requested, I often have to reiterate or specifically ask for certain details that would improve appearance and readability, such as text format improvements like bold headers, spacing between sections/paragraphs, Center text alignment, or even the use of specific (frowned upon) words that should be avoided on certain topics based on Ebay's policies. To be more specific about the policies, for example, I sell "water pipes" but Ebay does not allow for marketing marijuana products, up to an including paraphernalia, so all of my items must be marketed as "Tobacco products", which I often have to reiterate and have certain words edited out.

 When it comes to responding to customers, AI usually does great with simple issues, like an item being out of stock, but for more complicated situations, I find myself basically having to include so much specific detail that it would often be faster for me to just type out the entire response manually.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a pretty nuanced understanding of when AI saves you time versus when it doesn't. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anything that could benefit from a more "personal touch", I prefer to do myself. This most often applies to contacting or responding to customer communications when I want to communicate a certain message but also try to convey a certain tone. For example, if I want to be able to tell a customer that I can't provide them a full refund/return on a used product, but I want to be compassionate and make it clear that I am still wanting and able to help with their situatuation however I possibly can.

 When it comes to product listings, this is less common, but sometimes I want to include a nuanced description or opinion on an item that the AI can't seem to verbalize the way I prefer. In these situations, I generally just manually edit portions of the text provided by the AI. While I save some time with the template being created, it can still ends up being fairly time consuming at times.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the tone and nuance piece seems really important in those customer interactions. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you discuss AI use with others, or is it something you've figured out on your own?

User: I am self employed, and generally only work with my Spouse from home, so aside from random conversations on the general topic of AI, the vast majority of my experience learning with AI has been completely on my own for the most part.

AI: Got it - so you've really been your own guinea pig in figuring this all out. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Any time an AI can create a complicated item sales listing with a detailed item description that obeys all platform policies without much extra guidance in a matter of a few minutes, while maintaining my "style" of writing, it is very satisfying.

 On the contrary, I don't often find myself overly "frustrated" with AI, but I do find myself recognizing when AI is not going to be able to help with a situation in the way that I am seeking, and at that point I will generally walk away and try to complete the task manually on my own. If I had to choose one particular thing that bugs me the most, it is when I am using AI for product research, but I know the information I am receiving is verifiably not true or accurate (either from manual research or personal experience). There had been times, mostly earlier in my AI usage, when I would not catch the information inaccuracies, which translated to me misleading potential customers with incorrect descriptions.

AI: That's a really important point about the accuracy issues - it sounds like you've developed some strategies to verify information now. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I actually welcome the possibility of AI being able to take over many aspects of my E-commerce businesses, as usually once you have fully set up and established your store, a majority of the tasks are very repetitive and medial. For example, as a drop shipper, having text commands for AI to be able to gather the information from a sale on Ebay, then translate and transcribe it into an Email to my product suppliers in Gmail (including customer info/address) would be very useful. It could then also analyze incoming emails for the tracking number and then apply that to the order back on Ebay/Amazon/etc. 

 AI already has massive use in customer service chats, but they do not provide the same experience as talking to a real person at this time. That being said, if it ever becomes more difficult to distinguish between an AI offering chat support and myself offering chat support, that would also be welcomed. 

 My biggest concern regarding the improvement of AI features and support, is the protection of both my own and my customer's private information and the potential for it to be stolen/sold/shared/etc.

AI: That vision of automated workflow management sounds pretty compelling for your business. Privacy concerns make complete sense too.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology continues to develop?

User: I can only picture AI becoming more common and prevalent as time passes. Short term, I believe we will see the nuanced complexity of AIs/LLMs becoming harder to discern from real people or responses, and more automation of processes that help with things like the medial tasks I described. I believe this will be very beneficial for most people, including myself, as it will free up more time for other tasks.

 Long term, I must admit I am a bit intimidated by what the distant future of AI, automation, and more specifically, the potential for human dependence on AI or the realization that AI doesn't need humans in any particular way. Not so much a "Terminator" type of future scenario, but once AI can automate my entire store with true reasoning and rationalization, what is to stop it from just creating its entirely own store that copies all of my products, and then essentially becoming my competition and cutting me out, rather than helping me?

AI: Those are some really thoughtful reflections on both the near-term benefits and longer-term uncertainties. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your candid thoughts about the balance between efficiency gains and maintaining that personal touch with customers, and your nuanced view of both the opportunities and potential risks ahead.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating platform policies, the importance of accuracy in product descriptions, and your thoughtful perspective on the future of AI in e-commerce will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
