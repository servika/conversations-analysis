Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My company has partnered with an 3rd party company that has an AI system in place to help generate pre written emails and chats based on customer replies. I work in the online customer service industry for a few different retail companies.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI to help craft responses to customers. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? When a customer reaches out, how do you decide whether to use the AI-generated responses or write something yourself?

User: We have a programmed list of templates in a file that we are supposed to use for most basic situations that we then edit to fit the customer and the situation. Those templates are also programmed into the AI system so when we open an email on the right hand side a list of 5-10 responses that could be helpful will show up. They aren't always helpful and sometimes misinterpret the customers email. When they are helpful they will often have the template that we would use for that email but have filled in the customer details so we really just need to personalize to any special details the customer has given that don't fit the basic situation the template is based off. Sometimes if the customer has a lot of issues, or has a very complicated problem that isn't covered by templates the AI system will craft a more unique answer that is usually at least partially helpful to get us started!

AI: That's a really detailed picture - thank you. It sounds like the AI is doing quite a bit of the heavy lifting with customer details and even tackling more complex situations.

I'm curious about those moments when the AI misinterprets the customer's email. What does that look like, and how do you recognize when it's gotten something wrong?

User: Well to a point, it only has access to their name and email address and what is in the email. So anything else we have to pull from their account. It cant help with the problems in the email (such as doing the refunds, returns, checking on shipping, exchanges etc.) but it definitely helps craft the emails/chat or at least gives a good start. It happens quite often. I'm assuming its when the customer's email is too personalized or doesn't fit directly in with the templates and information fed to the AI so they have to guess how we would handle that situation. Plus giving 5-10 replies when normally only 1-2 would fit, give a lot of room for random replies. Sometimes it seems they cling on to a certain phrase or sentence in the email, even if it isn't the main problem, so then the response they give doesn't really help the actual problem and seems as if the we aren't listening to the customer (if that message was selected and sent). It's fairly easy to recognize when the model has gotten something wrong as it won't match up to the reply from the customer, or it will have the customers details but the template they have chosen is not usable for this situation.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - so you're constantly having to evaluate whether the AI has picked up on the right cues from the customer's message.

When the AI does get it right and provides you with a good starting point, how much time would you say it typically saves you compared to writing responses from scratch?

User: Even having access to the templates the AI uses in most responses, it still saves quite a bit of time. I would have to read the message, open the template file scan through the templates to find the situation and then find the fitting template, then copy and paste it into the reply and then go back in to enter the customer name and specific details from their email/chat. I would say it probably saves at least 5-10 minutes per email/chat depending how in depth.

AI: That's a significant time savings - 5-10 minutes per interaction really adds up over a full day.

Are there certain types of customer situations where you prefer to write the response yourself from the start, even when the AI offers suggestions? What makes you choose to go that route?

User: There are very few times when I would prefer to write the whole thing from scratch, but yes sometimes if the customer email is very specific and not a normal situation it is easier to write from scratch. Even in those cases I chose one of the AI replies, so that the customer name, greeting, and ending are prewritten. The system doesn't handle complicated multi issues as well and will typically only choose one issue to focus on. Its not a huge thing because it still gives good bones to start with.

AI: That's helpful to understand - so even in those complex cases, you're still finding value in at least the framework the AI provides.

When you do use the AI suggestions and then personalize them with the customer's special details, how would you describe that process? Are you working back and forth with the AI, or is it more like the AI hands you something and then you take it from there?

User: Depends if it is email or chat. If it is email and its just one response, then yes the AI hands it over and then I take care of the rest. If its chat and its back and fourth its working continuously with the AI for each response making sure they are keeping up with what the customer is saying and giving me replies that work.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction between email and chat - the chat environment sounds much more collaborative in real-time.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use this AI system? Do you all approach it similarly, or have you noticed different styles among your team?

User: For the most part we all approach it the same way. Working in an online environment I don't actually meet my co-workers, but when answering strings of emails I can see their work and replies, and we also use Slack for a work chat. From what I can gather most, aside from one or two that are more old school, prefer to work with the AI as much as possible since it does save time and make things easier. The one or two old school co-workers have mentioned not loving the AI and preferring to write it all themselves. I have seen some minor errors because of this. Just grammar or spelling since these are things the AI typically doesn't have a problem with.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - it sounds like the AI is generally embraced, but there are still some holdouts who prefer the traditional approach.

Can you share a time when using the AI system made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied, almost daily. It makes my life a lot easier when I don't have to write each reply from scratch. Frustrated, I haven't had any big issues other than a few times where the system didn't transfer the customer name into the appropriate spot so it was left as [customer name]. Luckily we as humans are there to check it all before sending, but there was a time or two where I assumed the model got it right and almost missed the error.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like you've developed a good rhythm with the system overall, but those little details like the name transfer definitely require that human oversight.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where the AI is now handling a lot of the work? Is this something you actively consider, or does it feel like your role has just naturally evolved?

User: I feel like my role has naturally evolved. I don't feel like my job is being taken over because the system helps me write replies. The models would have to get extremely better in order to never need human overview. On top of that, the model is helping with the replies, but not the actual work of handling the problems the emails are about.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - the AI is augmenting your work rather than replacing it, and you're still handling all the actual problem-solving.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing much from how you use it now?

User: I definitely think the system could be better. Like I've said there are often replies that don't make sense or can only focus on one issue, or don't transfer customer information. This is all small things but things I believe will just get better and more refined as time passes. On top of that I can imagine that it could also end up somewhat helping on the backside of things with shipping status etc. I think it would be possible at some point to train the models to be able to check a shipping website a company uses and check tracking to be able to give customers updates.

AI: Those are really thoughtful insights about where the technology could go - the idea of AI helping with the actual backend processes like tracking shipments is fascinating.

You've shared some really valuable perspectives about your day-to-day experience with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described the difference between email and chat interactions, and your balanced view of how your role is evolving rather than being replaced.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thats it thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI integrates into customer service work - from the daily time savings to the nuances of when it works well versus when human judgment is essential - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you walking me through the practical details of how this all works in your day-to-day role. Take care!
