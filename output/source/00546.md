Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes as we chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: that sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I sometimes use AI to generate worksheet tasks where i want something specific but repetitive - the same type of question but with different numbers. I am also using AI with a student to come up with mnemonics for each topic we cover - though the suggestions here are usually poor, they do give us something to work off of. And I regularly use AI for social media posts, blog posts, and email newsletter content - this is the main task I use AI for

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of tasks, from educational materials to content creation. 

When you mentioned that AI suggestions for mnemonics are usually poor but give you something to work off of, that caught my attention. Can you tell me more about that process - what happens between getting those initial suggestions and ending up with something useful?

User: So the student and I work through questions and then build a step by step guide together. we then highlight key words and pull out the initials. I then ask AI to suggest mnemonics for things like "R D W R M" - we get 15 ish suggestions and usually only one or two is any good, the rest are either really cringe or too weird. We can usually take a good one and tweak it slightly to get a working mnemonic. Do you need specific examples?

AI: That's a really clear picture of how you're collaborating with the AI and your student in that process. I can see how you're using AI as a starting point rather than expecting it to give you the perfect answer right away.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several different types of tasks - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: ah no, we wanted a perfect answer straight away. we just had to adapt when that wasnt happening. 

I think i do use AI for all i can. Im aware AI could give a step by step guide for each of the topics, but that rather defeats the point of the teaching - i need the student to be able to indentify the steps as we go through examples for themselves so they learn.

AI: That makes perfect sense - you want the student to develop their own understanding through the process, not just get handed the final answer.

When you do use AI for those tasks like worksheet generation, social media posts, and blog content, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate, as ive found thats the way to get high quality work. If I give the AI a task to handle independently then it gets riddled with little errors that take more time to fix than just working collaboratively does. 

One example is coming up with puzzles for my email newsletter. I like to have three puzzles per newsletter, on the same topic but of differing difficulty. If i just leave the AI with those instructions and let them do it they come back with puzzles that aren't differentiated, or are just textbook exercises rather than engaging puzzles, or are impossible to do. Now I come in with a topic idea, work with the AI to plot out the specific subsections of that topic that would be appropriate for different levels, and then finalise one level at a time - usually with a few rounds of revisions and tweaks needed.

AI: That's a really detailed example - I can see how that back-and-forth process helps you get something much more tailored and useful than a one-shot approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Im a private tutor so dont have that

AI: Ah, got it - that makes sense given the tutoring work you described. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Thats usually the same situtation! I get frustrated, push though, and then am extra satisfied when the task gets done. 

I do find it very frustrating when something goes wrong and i want to step back and analyse what caused the error (like, have i been unclear in the prompt?)  but when i ask the AI what happened on their end they get "flustered" and keep unsuccessfully trying to fix the issue rather than stop and tell me the issue so i can fix it. Or when you point out an issue in a responses logic and they reply "exactly!" before fixing it - that's always jarring. 

I now have all the different sections of my newsletter in different threads and the AI is learning from past entries as I create more - so this half term it was able to create a very good did you know piece from just a single prompt.

AI: That's a really vivid picture - the "exactly!" response when you point out an error does sound jarring. And it's interesting how you've found ways to work around some of those frustrations, like separating your newsletter sections into different threads.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have considered it, but i dont think AI can replace tutoring. The personal connection is too vital - students struggling wouldnt even know what to ask AI to get the help they need.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on the irreplaceable human element in tutoring.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I don't think i have scope to use it for more tasks - since it cant teach for me. But i may use it to help track students learning - more like an interactive database but that can give suggestions for next steps. However, given that im specially trained in this as a teacher I don't really need help. Its the repetative worksheets i will continue to get help creating, and i hope AIs ability to accurately determine difficulty level in maths improves (just using bigger numbers isnt harder, its just more tedious). And for the blog/newsletter - as clear writing isn't my core strength nor a particular interest, so its good to get that taken care of. I hope the smoothness of that continues to improve.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the personal connection in tutoring can't be replaced, and how you've developed this collaborative approach through trial and error to get better quality results.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no, i believe i covered everything

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach, the importance of iterating rather than expecting perfect results immediately, and how you've structured your workflow to work around AI's limitations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated getting such a detailed picture of how you use AI as a private tutor - it's a perspective we don't always get to hear about. Thanks again!
