Assistant: Hi there, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope - I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I regularly use AI for help with marketing copy in my job. I have also started using n8n to work on putting tasks into place that use AI and automation to make my workflow smoother

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI both directly for content creation and indirectly through automation workflows. 

Tell me more about the marketing copy work. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: We have courses that we list that are based on either Scrum Alliance courses, or courses that my boss has developed. I give AI the basics of what the course is about and ask it to help me come up with marketing centered copy to explain the course and also make it sound like something someone would want to sign up for

AI: So you're essentially taking course content and transforming it into compelling marketing material. When you say you give AI "the basics" - what kind of information are you typically providing? Are you giving it raw course descriptions, learning objectives, or something else?

User: Sometimes it raw course descriptions - especially when it's a course that we have come up with on our own. If it's based on a Scrum Essentials course, I just ask it if it knows the course and can find the info itself

AI: That's a smart approach - leveraging AI's existing knowledge when possible. 

When you're working on this marketing copy, how do you typically interact with the AI? Do you give it all the information upfront and let it generate the complete copy, or do you work back and forth with it to refine the messaging?

User: I definitely remind the messaging - I find AI tends to use the same phrases a lot - Unleash, Unlock, Master, etc. I have to make sure those phrases aren't used because it makes it very obvious that AI has done the copy

AI: Ah, so you've noticed those telltale AI patterns in the language. That's a really specific insight about maintaining authenticity in the output.

When you're refining that messaging, what does that back-and-forth process look like? Are you giving it specific feedback about what to avoid, or are you more focused on steering it toward a particular tone or style?

User: I will tell it to avoid certain words.  I do ask it to keep a certain tone when I work with it on refining newsletter copy from my boss. In that instance, I have his writing, but want it to be cleaned up - grammatically correct, perhaps flow better - but keep the same tone

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI differently depending on whether you're creating new marketing copy or refining your boss's existing writing. 

Tell me more about that newsletter work. How do you communicate to the AI what your boss's tone is like, or what aspects of his voice you want to preserve?

User: I've been able to just copy the text my boss wrote, and say "keep the general tone, but clean it up"  and that has worked

AI: That's really efficient - it sounds like the AI picks up on his voice pretty intuitively from just that instruction.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do enjoy data entry and basic debugging, but AI is such a helpful tool that I find myself leaning towards it anyway. It frees my time up for other things

AI: That's an interesting tension - you mentioned you actually enjoy those tasks but still choose to delegate them to AI for efficiency. 

What are those "other things" that you prefer to focus your freed-up time on? What kinds of work feel most important for you to handle personally?

User: I am still learning what AI can do, so it gives me time to take courses on how to better understand. It also just allows me to do other personal work because my job isn't taking as long

AI: So AI is creating space not just for different work tasks, but for your own learning and development - that's a really interesting dynamic.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at your company using it similarly, or are you kind of pioneering this approach?

User: Absolutely - my job is very much focused on implanting AI training to our clients. My boss is leading the push for us to learn how we can better incorporate it into our every day work flow so we can help other people do the same

AI: That's a unique position - you're not just using AI for your own work, but learning to teach others how to integrate it. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: In using n8n - I have been trying to combine automation with AI in figuring our Google Analytics for our website.  Automation has been around for longer, and is easier to use - when trying to pair it with a call to Gemini or something, there can be some frustrations. But when the tasks completes - it's amazing

AI: That sounds like a real "eureka" moment when it finally works! The frustration followed by that breakthrough feeling.

Tell me more about what specifically was frustrating in that process. Was it the technical integration between n8n and the AI, or something else about getting those systems to work together?

User: Yes the technical integration - or trying to figure out exactly what the n8n platform is looking for in terms of coding language - how to access the information being provided - and how to interconnect all of the nodes to make a working workflow

AI: That technical troubleshooting phase sounds pretty complex - you're essentially learning to speak between different systems that weren't necessarily designed to work together seamlessly.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do worry about AI taking over certain areas, but that also can allow the human mind to branch out and find other things to focus on

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - seeing AI displacement as potentially opening up new opportunities rather than just closing off old ones.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it taking over operational procedures, but still needing some direction and human interaction to keep it on track. I see myself working with it - asking questions, having conversations, like we are now

AI: That's a really insightful way to think about it - AI handling the operational heavy lifting while you provide the strategic direction and guidance.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI is freeing up time not just for different work tasks, but for your own learning and development - and how you're navigating that balance between efficiency and maintaining authenticity in your marketing copy.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope - this was a great convo - thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how candidly you talked about both the successes and frustrations - that kind of honest perspective is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are actually being used in the real world.

Have a great rest of your day!
