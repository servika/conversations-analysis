Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a graphic designer and digital pet portrait artist. I started using AI for different aspects of the job to help those tasks go faster. Some examples are helping to brainstorm blogposts for my website, and to edit blogposts I created. Another huge time saver that I've found using AI is when listing my art pieces on different Print on Demand websites. I use AI to make a compelling description for the art and then have it help me create tags so that my work can be found. I have actually found a boost in discovery of my art since using these methods.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become quite integral to the business side of your art practice. You mentioned seeing a boost in discovery since using AI for descriptions and tags.

When you're working on these tasks like brainstorming blog posts or creating product descriptions, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: For the blog posts, when it comes time to create one I will start with a rough idea. For example, if I want to talk about photography and how it plays a part in my digital pet portrait creation as good and bad photos can make or break a finished painting. I will ask AI to give me ideas that I can write about related to this topic and then even run my rough draft through a model to give it that final polish.  As for the descriptions for my art pieces, some of the print on demand sites are using AI to help create descriptions, I just take it a step further and run the descriptions a final time through Chat GPT or a similar model to make it even more polished. I do the same with tags.

AI: That's really interesting how you're layering AI assistance - using the platform's AI as a starting point and then refining it further with your own AI interactions. 

Tell me more about that final polishing step you do. What specifically are you looking for when you run those descriptions through ChatGPT or similar models?

User: I find that the platforms AI does a good generic start as it sees the uploaded image and describes the subject and color palette. When I run that description through another AI model, I will copy and paste the description from the platform, and then tell the third part model like Chat GPT or Gemini to make that description more engaging, such as describing what type of room it would look good in (office, bedroom, living room) color scheme, ect. I also will have the model rewrite the existing description so that it has a more engaging, personal tone. I feel that this sets my descriptions and art out from the rest of the users on the platform that don't go the extra mile with this additional step.

AI: That's a smart strategic approach - using that extra step to differentiate yourself from other artists on the platform. You mentioned wanting a more "engaging, personal tone" in your descriptions.

What does that personal tone look like to you? How do you recognize when AI has captured the right voice for your brand?

User: Well, in the platforms AI model, I find the descriptions are very boring. For example, if I am uploading a mountain landscape in fall colors, it will describe that literally without any flourish. When I take that description and run it through say Gemini, I ask for the model to make the description engaging and describe the scene to get the user to imagine they are there. So for a mountain scene I will have the model use descriptions of crisp, cool air, the crunch of leaves on a trail, the babbling brook or stream. All are elements in the image I painted, but describing them in this way gets the viewer and potential buyer to image themselves in the scene, making it a bit more personal.

AI: That makes complete sense - you're transforming a factual inventory into an immersive experience. It sounds like you've developed a real feel for guiding AI to match your artistic vision.

Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Well of course I do the art myself as it is what I love. I know the models are getting better at image generation, but I am on the fence about its use as many people can abuse this feature and pass off AI generated art as their own, which affects other artists who create their own art. That being said, most administrative tasks such as blog posts, text content for my website, descriptions and tags for the art as I previously mentioned are all fair game to be passed on to AI to do. One interesting thing that I will note that I've started doing is creating my own reference photos. I will describe the elements I want in an image like "a rearing appaloosa horse with mountains in the distance and two other horses grazing." This will create a unique image that I can reference when creating my own original art, without having to worry about copyrights of someone else's photos. I've just started doing this and I find it is a new and exciting way to have AI as a tool in my work life.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI as a creative tool for reference generation while maintaining the integrity of your actual artistic creation. The reference photo approach sounds like it gives you both creative freedom and legal peace of mind.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: So I like to maintain some control over most tasks so I am usually collaborating the whole time. I will start with an idea for a blog post and then work through it with an AI model, refining things adding stuff, taking stuff out or changing tone. The only time where I will let AI do its own thing is brief email generation, but even then I look it over before the email is sent out.

AI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've found a balance where you stay in the driver's seat while leveraging AI's capabilities.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're working as an independent artist, I'm curious about how other artists or the broader creative community has shaped your approach.

User: Well as an independent artist, I thought AI was scary at first. I was seeing alot of the comments of fellow artists stating that AI was going to take over and then artists will be out of a job. Even now most artists are very wary of AI and AI generated images. I now see it as a tool, and sure there will be people that abuse it, but that is going to be everywhere and with many different tools. I find that AI is a time saver, especially in the more monotonous parts of the job like email generation, description and tag generation ect. It also helps with the fun stuff though like reference image generation. I can't draw what's in my mind. I've never been good at that, but if I can describe what is in my mind to AI, it cant create an image that I can reference to create a unique piece of art.

AI: That evolution in your thinking is really compelling - from seeing AI as a threat to recognizing it as a tool that can actually enhance your creative process, especially for tasks you find challenging like translating mental images into visual references.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well I had one experience fairly recently. I was trying to experiment to see if Gemini could create a color palette for a dragonfly mandala drawing I made. I asked for a color palette based on greens and blues with a little bit of orange. Gemini stated that it could and even mentioned that it could provide a zip file for the color palette that I could directly import into Procreate, which is the art app I use on my iPad. I was super excited to try this out, however when I imported the file and opened up the palette, it was all black, with no colors at all. I figure it was a little more of an advance ting to ask, but thought I'd try anyways. Maybe we will eventually get there and that would be awesome!

AI: That's such a perfect example of the gap between what AI promises and what it can actually deliver! It must have been particularly disappointing since Gemini seemed so confident about creating that zip file.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well because, I am always actively collaborating in my usage of AI, I feel that I will still maintain my skills, even in areas that AI could take over such as the administrative writing tasks. I don't worry too much as I have embraced AI more as a tool rather than something to be feared. I could do all those writing tasks myself and never use AI but then there would be less time to create art. I figure, might as well let AI do the stuff it excels at, and I will do the stuff I excel at.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - using AI to free up time for what you're passionate about rather than seeing it as competition.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that it will continue to get better. I will find ways to be more efficient using AI. There may be more things that it can handle eventually like color palette generation, and I'll embrace that, but again it is a tool that I enjoy because it makes my life easier.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on evolving from viewing AI as a threat to embracing it as a tool that frees you up to focus on what you love most - creating art.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think we are good.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between AI assistance and creative control, and how you've navigated the concerns within the artist community, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
