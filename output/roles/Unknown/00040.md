Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, im ready to start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Recently I was put on a new heat exchanger, where we flowed cooling water through a tube side and hot steam through the shell side. I was tasked in developing a procedure in order to find the overall heat transfer coefficient of our machine.

AI: That sounds like an interesting project. Tell me more about what developing that procedure involved - what were the steps you went through from being assigned that task to having a working procedure?

User: I started out by laying out my objectives. I wanted to find the overall heat transfer coefficient for counter current flow in our new heat exchanger. I familiarized myself with the online equipment for changing values such as cooling water flow rate, and I determined a plan that varied with different flow rates from 10-25 gpm to find a overall heat transfer coefficient from various ranges of flow.

AI: That sounds like a systematic approach - setting clear objectives, getting familiar with the equipment, and planning your experimental range. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I experimented in the beginning with developing the plan. This involved preliminary equations such as the equation for a heat transfer coefficient and correlation for baffles on the inside of the heat exchanger. I also consulted it for error analysis.

AI: Interesting - so AI helped you with the foundational equations and correlations, plus the error analysis. 

For developing those preliminary equations and baffle correlations specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for getting that information.

User: For the baffle correlations, I found those in one of our textbooks. I mostly used AI to back up what I found since I hadn't experimented in using baffles in a heat exchanger before. For the foundational equations, I knew they'd be easy to look up, so I used AI in order to cut down on the time it took to complete this introductory task.

AI: So it sounds like AI served different purposes for you - as a backup verification tool for the baffle correlations you found in textbooks, and as a time-saver for the foundational equations you knew you could find elsewhere.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like the hands-on equipment work or data collection - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: Mostly, my company would not allow the use of AI in the actual data collection process or hands-on work; we do that all manually, especially when starting out on a new machine.

AI: That makes sense - company policy around manual data collection, especially for new equipment where you're establishing baselines.

When you used AI for those preliminary equations and to verify the baffle correlations, how did you go about checking or validating what it gave you?

User: I compared what the AI model gave me with what I had previously known, and I compared it to literature equations.

AI: That's a solid verification approach - cross-referencing with your existing knowledge and literature. 

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research work that it currently doesn't - whether due to company policy or technical limitations - what would that be and why?

User: I would love for AI to help me in making decisions about how to set up my experiment. This stage is usually very iterative and long, so AI could help me cut down on the time taken. AI can also scan for most safety concerns, which is of utmost importance.

AI: That's a really compelling vision - using AI to streamline the experimental design process and catch safety issues early. It sounds like that iterative setup phase is a real time sink for you.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI as both a verification tool and time-saver, while recognizing the boundaries around data collection, was particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can serve as both a verification backup and a time-saving tool for foundational work - while respecting the need for manual processes in data collection - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

Your point about wanting AI assistance with experimental design and safety screening was especially valuable, as it shows how AI could potentially address some of the more time-intensive and critical aspects of research planning.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
