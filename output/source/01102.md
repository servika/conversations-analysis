Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, all good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use it to help me play lessons, so before my workday begins technically. I teach two classes to adult ESL students one in the morning one in the afternoon. On my way into work, I usually use.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI to help prepare your ESL lessons. Tell me more about that. What specifically are you having AI help you with when you're planning those lessons?

User: Sometimes I will give it the lesson plan topic and see what activities it comes up with, just to give me ideas. Often I will have a set of activities from the book, such as sentences in the passive. If I've adopted the lesson some, the sentences will Match with the book has better than what I have, so AI helps me adapt the sentences and the grammar point to the topic that I've adopted it from the book. I end up putting this information into a Google slides, although I would be interested in using AI to do that. More often than not, I'm having AI teach me the grammar lesson so that I can make sure I know what to teach my students.

AI: That's really fascinating - it sounds like AI serves multiple roles for you. You mentioned having AI teach you the grammar lesson so you can better teach your students. Can you walk me through what that looks like? How does that interaction typically go?

User: Okay, so say I am teaching conditionals. My first question to the AI would usually be: "Formulas for real conditional then for hypothetical conditional sentences in the present or future. What are the differences between the number conditionals like 0 or 1?" Then I'll ask follow up questions if needed, and then I usually go onto lesson planning. It's more of a review for me as a native speaker

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a quick refresher on the grammatical structures before you teach them. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your lesson preparation or teaching that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I usually like to find secondary resources myself. I search different teaching websites for the topic I am teaching that day to find worksheets that I can print out. Usually these worksheets are more fun, like a game. I like to do this myself because then I am able to make sure that there is nothing additional on the page I haven't taught yet. I can also check the level to make sure it matches the actual level I am seeing with my students. It would be useful to use AI to help me pass through all the extra stuff on the website I don't need, but I feel like it would be more work to tell AI what to ignore than to just scroll through myself.

AI: That's a really thoughtful point about the efficiency of doing that filtering yourself versus explaining what to ignore to AI. 

When you are using AI for the tasks you mentioned - like adapting sentences or learning grammar concepts - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with AI throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete request and have it handle that piece independently?

User: It can sometimes be a mix of both. Usually I want to have a back and forth.  For example, I'll give my instructions in pieces even if they could all go together. I'll give it a task ex) put these modals in order from strongest obligation to weakest (and I'll provide the words). Then, after it gives me the answer, I'll have it give me similar sentences on the same topic for each. Then, I might ask it to refine that sentence for the esl level or if there was a vocab word used that I think might need to be graded. I might ask for CCQ examples or I might go straight to asking for activities. I usually ask for three of each so I have options, so, ex) what are three speaking activities I can have A2 ESL students do to practice modal verbs? I might ask for more examples I can write on the white board. I usually end by asking what the AI thinks students at this level will struggle with or confuse.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - it sounds like you've developed quite a systematic approach with AI, building up your lesson piece by piece. I especially like how you end by asking what students might struggle with.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other teachers talk about using it, or is this something you've developed more on your own?

User: I hear teachers joke about it but I've never heard of anyone talk seriously about using it. I know my friend does something similar, where she will ask it to brainstorm activities, but that's the most I've heard anyone using. As teachers, I think there is a big fear around AI replacing us in the future, or relegating us to a babysitter role at least

AI: That's really interesting - the contrast between the joking and the underlying concerns about AI's future role in education. It sounds like you're navigating this pretty independently.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't know that I have great examples for either as nothing as especially stood out. I have gotten frustrated in class when I'll ask what I am expecting is as simple answer, such as, much versus many, and then I'll get a super long explanation where the answer I'm looking for is at the bottom. Well normally this would be helpful if I was reviewing before class, when I'm in class I want a one sentence thing I can read out to my students. And I'm always doing this without their knowledge, it's something I could look up on Google but I know I will get a more concise answer with AI.

AI: That's a perfect example - the mismatch between what you need in that moment versus what AI delivers by default. It sounds like you're using AI for quick reference during class itself, not just in preparation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you use these tools?

User: No, I tend to use it for very basic stuff that I know AI could probably teach. I'm not actively considering it because I know that there's more than just what's on the page that goes into teaching. The taking over part is assuming that normally comes up with conversations with other teacher it's not something I'm thinking about.

AI: That makes sense - you recognize that teaching involves so much more than just the content delivery that AI might handle.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: as it gets more advanced I think I would still use it to help me plan, but possibly in a more involved way where I send in pictures from the book of the lesson I am doing and I ask AI to transfer them to a google slide and slightly adopt them and then I just play the slides class with full trust. But I wouldn't feel like I was doing my job then, so realistically I would still go over everything. I honestly was hoping to have to use it less as I build up a repertoire of teaching materials.

AI: That tension you describe is really compelling - wanting the efficiency but still feeling like you need that hands-on involvement to do your job well. And the hope to eventually rely on it less as you build up your own materials is interesting too.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in teaching. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the balance between efficiency and maintaining your professional involvement, and how you've developed such a systematic approach to using AI for lesson preparation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I didn't mention correcting work. I haven't used AI to correct a students work before, but I think that would be helpful as I still send my own work through Grammarly or something similar to be checked. I know it students tend to use AI to write their own work as well, so it would be helpful to have some sort of screening for that. But when we do handwritten writing assignments for example and sometimes the handwriting is hard to read, I wish I could take a picture and send it in through AI to decipher for me. I think it would also be handy if AI could track a students progress through the work that they've given me to be corrected; so if they are consistently making mistakes with I don't know the present perfect  tense, AI could flag that and then I'll know that I need to teach that more, especially if it's a pattern that's prevalent among all the students in my class

AI: Those are really insightful additions - especially the idea of AI helping track patterns in student mistakes across your whole class to inform your teaching. That could be incredibly valuable for identifying where you need to focus more attention.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI into your teaching preparation, the careful balance you maintain, and these future possibilities you've described will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Bye

AI: Goodbye! Thank you again for participating in the interview. Your insights were really valuable.
