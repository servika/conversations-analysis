Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have two careers and they each have an individual use for AI. As a financial advisor, I ask AI for creating follow up messages after a client meeting or help me to create ideas to expand my book. As an electronics repair business owner, I use AI to help me with creating posts about my business to increase customer outreach and brand recognition

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI across two very different professional contexts. 

When you're creating those follow-up messages for clients or working on business posts, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you and the AI work together on those tasks?

User: when creating follow up messages for clients, I will wait a few days after the last contact and ask AI then. Ill provide context of the situation and facts of the last interaction and ask how to proceed from there. For the computer repair business, I ask AI for relevant topics in the computer industry that can also be explained to a broader audience. Ill also ask to create an engaging post that is more likely to get attention of the algorithm. Lastly, I'll ask when the best time is to post the content

AI: So you're giving AI the context and having it generate content, but you mentioned asking "how to proceed" for client follow-ups. That sounds like you might be getting strategic advice rather than just having AI write the message for you.

Tell me more about that - are you typically asking AI to write the actual follow-up message, or are you more looking for guidance on what approach to take?

User: I would say its an AI assisted process. I have an idea, then ask AI to write the follow up message, then will work with AI to refine the message and make any changes I want before sending

AI: That collaborative refinement process sounds really hands-on. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in either of your businesses that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: For both careers, I prefer to call and email clients and prospects myself. I am aware that AI can make calls and send emails on my behalf, however I prefer to generate the messages with AI and call myself or use a Python script to email clients. I prefer to do the outreach myself because its more genuine and some people can tell the difference between an AI or human written message

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction - using AI to help craft the message but keeping the human touch in the actual delivery.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you collaborate back and forth quite a bit, but I'm curious - are there ever times when you delegate a complete task for AI to handle independently, or is it usually that collaborative refinement process you described?

User: I cant think of any uses where I use AI to complete a whole task by itself. The closest may be when I am doing a repair and cannot find the issue after diagnosing. The only reason I am unable to fully delegate this to AI is because the repair is a physical act and I do not have access to an AI that can do physical tasks

AI: That's a really interesting point about the physical limitation being the main barrier there. It sounds like even in your most independent AI use case, you'd still want that hands-on control if it were possible.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you have two different professional environments, I'm curious if you've noticed different attitudes or approaches between them.

User: For the financial advisor position, collegues and the industry is embracing AI to help summarize meeting notes for advisors and clients. I have spoken to other advisors who will also use AI for complex problems such as time value of money or other planning concepts. I am unaware of how others in the computer repair industry are using AI

AI: So you're seeing more open adoption and discussion in the financial advisor world. That's helpful context.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was asking AI to write an email to a prospect that ghosted me as I was trying to reignite the relationship. Unfortunately, the chatbot was not fully understanding the situation after several rounds and I ended up creating my own email to send

AI: That sounds frustrating - when you needed AI to grasp the nuance of a delicate client relationship situation, but it kept missing the mark despite your attempts to clarify.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes! I think that AI will be the next internet where everything is integrated with it. Of course, every industry will have to change, so the best way to maintain skills is to keep up with industry news in the finance and computer repair channels. If I am well informed, then I can be able to stand out. I believe that the best workers will also learn how to use AI better then their peers.

AI: That perspective of AI as the "next internet" is really insightful - treating it as a fundamental shift that will be everywhere rather than just a tool.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Given what you just said about learning to use it better than peers, what does that look like for you specifically?

User: I will continue to use AI to help develop my skills and business. For me personally, learning prompt engineering is extremely important as it enables me to get to the answer I am looking for quicker while providing valuable feedback for the model

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI being like "the next internet" and how you're thinking strategically about prompt engineering as a competitive advantage.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI across two different industries, that collaborative refinement process you described, and your forward-thinking approach to prompt engineering will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
