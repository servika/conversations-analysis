Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: All good. No questions.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI for brainstorming and gathering information.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does brainstorming with AI look like for you in practice?

User: Well, I work for an online training development company. Sometimes we create training products that demonstrate various scenarios workers will need to learn about. I could ask AI to create a scenario that demonstrates workers using a new computer system, for example.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI to help create realistic workplace scenarios for training content. When you ask AI to create these scenarios, how detailed are the scenarios it generates? Are they typically ready to use as-is, or do you find yourself needing to modify them?

User: I might use an idea. It really varies.

AI: Can you walk me through a specific example where you used an AI-generated scenario? What happened with that particular scenario - did you end up using the idea directly, or how did you adapt it?

User: Recently, we created a training video for Walmart Canada that illustrated how workers could avoid bias in the workplace. The AI model provided some ideas about language that could be used to create a more positive, inclusive environment for all workers.

AI: That sounds like a meaningful project. When the AI provided those language suggestions for creating an inclusive workplace, what did you do with those ideas? How did they end up fitting into the final training video?

User: In this case, we used the model's ideas. First, a scenario was presented that showed a manager speaking to a worker in a less-constructive way that made her feel badly about herself. Later, the video showed how a better use of language could help to build the training worker up instead of breaking down her confidence. Another idea was presented that involved the worker speaking to another worker negatively about a third employee. The scenario evolved to demonstrate that the third employee could be made to feel badly by this, and it is also unprofessional.

AI: It sounds like the AI helped you develop both the problematic and improved versions of these workplace interactions. When you were working with these AI-generated scenarios, did you collaborate with the AI throughout the process - going back and forth to refine the scenarios - or did you take the initial suggestions and then work on them independently?

User: Yes, I like to colaborate and make suggestions to refine the ideas.

AI: What does that back-and-forth process look like for you? How do you typically guide the AI when you want to refine or adjust the scenarios it suggests?

User: Basically, I would input a prompt that says something like, "How about if we tried this idea instead of that second part you mentioned. I liked the first part but the second part seems a bit forced/awkward."

AI: That's a really natural way to collaborate with AI - giving specific feedback on what's working and what isn't. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I would not ask AI to write a script. I know others disagree, and even use AI for this purpose. In the past, I was often the last-look editor of scripts heading for training product development, and I could sometimes detect that the writing was done by an AI model. Maybe this is changing. I personally prefer to write myself. I do use Grammarly, which might count as an AI product, but again, I often prefer my own judgment. It is good for catching typos, but it is often wrong as well. We are starting to use AI for voiceovers on occasion, and can almost use it for translations too, now. We are in Canada, so we often need to create French and English products, and we have no native French speakers on staff. It is a very small company with repeat outsourcing to trusted contractors. The voice artists are very expensive, so we sometimes try to get a good product without a voice artist. This can still fail sometimes. If we are using a French voice artist, we can usually get away with using AI for the translating now, and the voice artist will let us know if any errors are found in the French script. AI can't make good visual products yet, like animated training videos. At least, the products we have tried can't do this.

AI: You've touched on some really thoughtful distinctions about where you draw the line with AI assistance. When you mentioned being able to detect AI-written scripts in your editing role, what specifically tipped you off that they were AI-generated? What made them feel different from human-written content?

User: The style of  writing is a bit too "stuffy" if that makes sense. A bit too wordy, even when you are looking for professional communication. Sometimes, in contrast, the wording is not professional enough. Honestly, it is hard to pinpoint. It just doesn't seem "natural." You get used to the way that AI writes, and you can detect it sometimes.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've developed an instinct for recognizing that particular AI writing style. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned that others disagree about using AI for scriptwriting - how does that play out at your company?

User: It is usually me stating that I can detect AI was used. When this has happened, I was often the editor, as I mentioned, so I would change the wording to my own.

AI: So you're often in the position of being the one who catches and corrects AI-generated writing. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It is usually very satisfying when you have some sort of a creative block and the AI model provides some relevant ideas. Another thing that is very satisfying, as I mentioned, is having a voice product that sounds great. Occasionally, the client has come back to use and asked for a change in voice, but when the generated voice works we are saving a huge amount of time and money. The translations also save huge amounts of time and money.

AI: Those sound like really meaningful wins - breaking through creative blocks and the practical benefits of cost and time savings. On the flip side, have there been moments when working with AI felt particularly frustrating for you?

User: Yes. Sometimes AI models make mistakes. I have noticed this often when searching for general, up-to-date information about a variety of topics. For this reason, I tend to use Google to ask for current information. I don't trust AI to generate correct answers. With Google, I can see if a website is current, for example. AI might answer by providing me with information from 5 years ago, and I won't know it. Of course, now we are presented with a response from Gemini through Google as well. You can scroll past the Gemini response if you want to, to access the search results instead.

AI: That's a really important point about information currency and verification. It sounds like you've developed strategies for working around those limitations. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Absolutely. In the eLearning development space, this is a huge consideration. A lot of eLearning development is being phased out by AI models.

AI: That's a significant shift in your industry. What are you doing to navigate that change? How are you thinking about positioning yourself as AI takes over more eLearning development work?

User: Well, we decided to become experts at how AI can be used in our field. We are always testing new implementation ideas. We also focus on areas that AI isn't good at yet, like creating training videos, for example.

AI: That's a really strategic approach - becoming experts in AI implementation while focusing on areas where human expertise still has clear advantages. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I really don't know. That is a very good question. I guess we will just have to be flexible and react to what comes next.

AI: That's such an honest answer - the uncertainty really captures what many people are experiencing right now. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being able to detect AI-generated writing and how you're strategically positioning your company to work with AI rather than be replaced by it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I guess that when AI becomes better at image generation it could be a game-changer. AI has shortened the production cycle significantly for us. There could come a point where training development does not need to be outsourced in our lifetimes.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the potential trajectory of your industry. The idea that AI image generation improvements could eliminate the need for outsourcing entirely is quite significant for how work gets structured.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating this shift - from developing instincts for detecting AI writing to strategically positioning your company as AI experts - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
