Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Sure. I'm a freelance photographer. I specialize in wildlife and pet photography, but I also help with portrait photos and engagement shoots. I also am starting up a business to sell prints, but that hasn't been launched yet. I'm also trying to gain an online presence with social media

AI: That sounds like a really diverse and exciting mix of photography work. I can imagine each type - wildlife, pets, portraits, engagement shoots - probably has its own unique challenges and creative processes.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I'd say it's twofold. As I'm new to the career, it helps me drill down on best practices, especially for things like post-processing. E.g., how to do a specific thing while editing photos. 

The other key way in which I use it is to help distill search results to make research more efficient. For example, I use it to gain information about migration patterns for birds, or to consilidate and compare specs for different camera equipment to get a sense of how best to upgrade my gear.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI more as a knowledge partner and research assistant rather than directly in the creative output itself. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yeah, I tend to avoid using it for anything creative. 

Most recently, I knew I had to integrate macro photography into my portfolio, so I needed a new lens. I used AI to consolidate specs and reviews of a few different options based on my current gear, and it helped me make my decision.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it to cut through all the technical information and reviews to make an informed decision. 

When you mentioned that you tend to avoid using AI for anything creative, tell me more about that. What drives that choice for you?

User: Well, for me, a huge part of the fun of photography is capturing a moment or a subject and using post-processing to bring out the best of the dynamic range. Using AI in this process would make the art of the process less authentic

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on authenticity in your work. It sounds like there's something important to you about that hands-on creative process and making those artistic choices yourself.

When you're working with AI for the research and technical aspects - like learning post-processing techniques or researching equipment - how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the decisions in those moments?

User: In those cases, I'm using AI as a collaborator to save time with "busy work". For example, I could read all the articles and reviews about the lenses I was considering by myself, and I'd successfully make the right decision, but using AI for that part helps save time so I can move on with the most important parts of the job. Plus, I'm buying these lenses second hand, so I often need to act fast and time is of the essence.

AI: That's a really clear distinction you're making - using AI to handle the time-intensive research and technical learning so you can focus your energy on the core creative work. It sounds like you see it as freeing up your time for what matters most to you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: It hasn't really affected my creative work at all. I do my best to keep AI out of the creative side

AI: I hear you - you've been very intentional about keeping that boundary. But I'm curious about the efficiency side. Since you've been using AI for research and learning post-processing techniques, has that changed how you approach projects or manage your time as a freelance photographer?

User: Maybe slightly. Just in the sense that it allows me to cut through some of the administrative hurdles

AI: That makes sense - streamlining those administrative and research tasks. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of photography?

User: I worry specifically about denoising software. Some of this software uses AI to artificially sharpen and clean up images to a point that is far beyond what is possible given the metadata of the photo at the time of capture. It feels kind of like cheating

AI: That's a really specific and thoughtful concern - the idea that AI denoising could push images beyond what was actually captured in that moment. It sounds like there's a line for you between enhancing what was there versus creating something that wasn't.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see lots of pro photographers using this denoising AI, so I fear the art of photography will be less about the skill of capturing a moment with the technical know-how, and it'll more be about being in the right place at the right time, and there'll be less skill involved in capturing pictures

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how the field itself might be shifting. It sounds like you're concerned about a potential devaluing of the technical mastery and craft that goes into capturing that perfect shot in-camera.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI, particularly your clear boundaries around maintaining authenticity in the creative process while leveraging AI for efficiency in research and learning. I found your perspective on denoising software and its impact on the skill aspect of photography especially compelling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your photography work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authenticity while strategically using AI for efficiency, and your concerns about how AI might change the fundamental skills valued in photography, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your workflow while preserving what matters most to you about the creative process. Best of luck with your photography business and that upcoming print venture!
