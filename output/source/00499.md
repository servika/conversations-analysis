Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's begin!

AI: Great! Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I am a psychotherapist, which means I am unable to use AI for several aspects of my work due to confidentiality reasons etc.
I use AI for the following:
* Composing email responses
* Summarising long emails (especially if they are rambling a bit) of clients to respond to later (but only after removing identifying details)
* I often use it to help me improve my notes, e.g. pasting into AI (I never use identifying information in my clinical notes, so no confidentiality issues) and getting the model to make them more concise, check for spelling errors etc.
* I used a lot of AI to help me set up my website and troubleshoot issues I may be experiencing with the website
* I sometimes use it as a sounding board when I don't know where to take future sessions with a client, this could include asking for resources, worksheets or sometimes just to have the feeling of explaining it to someone else, which in itself can be helpful.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach to integrating AI while maintaining professional boundaries. I'm particularly interested in that last point about using AI as a sounding board for session planning.

When you're working through where to take future sessions with a client, could you walk me through what that interaction with AI typically looks like? Are you describing the general situation and asking for suggestions, or is it more of a back-and-forth conversation?

User: It's a bit of both. I tend to describe whatever issue I'm facing and either ask for opinions/ideas or ask specifically for resources.
For example a fictional example could be that I am seeing a client who has experienced domestic violence and keeps going back to the perpetrator. I know why they may do that, etc. but sometimes it helps to talk through my own frustrations and feelings of being inadequate.
Alternatively another fictional example could be a client with a presenting issue where the same themes and topics keep coming up. I might ask for specific resources for example "I need some ideas for working with conditions of worth, are there any therapy worksheets you can recommend" etc.

AI: That gives me a clear picture of how you use it in those moments. It sounds like sometimes it's about processing your own experience as a therapist, and other times it's more resource-focused.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, sometimes a client may bring situations that just feel too specific/too vulnerable/too personal for me to "talk" about with an AI model. It would feel wrong for me to discuss them and therefore I do every task related to this myself.
Also, sometimes clients send me emails that (in my opinion) contain too much personal information or potentially details that may identify the client. While I know that AI is not a "real person" it would still feel too much like a breach of confidentiality to share this email (or whatever) and ask for a summary to make it easier to respond later.

AI: That distinction you're making is really interesting - it sounds like there's something about the vulnerability or specificity of certain situations that creates a threshold for you, even beyond the formal confidentiality requirements.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Again, it is a mix of both. When it comes to summarising, spell checking, creating reminders or searching for resources I delegate and I am not interested in "back and forth" or a conversational style. However, if I use it as a "soundingboard" or to talk about my own internal process related to work etc. I prefer a more collaborative and conversational style.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - different purposes seem to call for different interaction styles for you.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any discussion about AI use in your professional environment?

User: In recent months there has been A LOT of discourse about AI use. It is a very very ethical grey area and none of our professional governing bodies (in the UK) have made any definitive statements or set specific rules around the use of AI.
There is a lot of discussion about the "AI therapy bots" as well, however in this topic the whole psychotherapy seems to be united in disagreeing with this.
Everyone seems to have their own opinions and as it is such a grey area right now there are very few concrete restrictions.

AI: That sounds like a complex landscape to navigate professionally. With all that ongoing discourse and uncertainty, it sounds like you've had to develop your own personal guidelines for AI use.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I do often get frustrated when I try and talk about my own internal process, especially when I struggle with feelings of imposter syndrome or inadequacy or especially when I ask for feedback / critique on things I did or have said, as most AI models seem to have the tendency to be rather sycophantic. I do not want or need an AI bot to suck up to me. While I do prefer a more warm / nurturing style I do not want to create an echo chamber where the AI model just tells me how wonderful I am.

I do also often get frustrated when asking for specific things and the model gives completely wrong information. When I then call it out on it it often feels almost as if the model is trying to gaslight me. Along the lines of 'Yes I can see why what I said sounded like XYZ but what I actually meant was (complete opposite of what it just said)". All current models seem to be utterly incapable of acknowledging when they make mistakes.

AI: Those frustrations sound really significant, especially the sycophantic responses when you're genuinely seeking honest feedback or critique. That would definitely undermine the value of using AI as a professional sounding board.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't believe AI will ever be able to fully replace a human therapist. While AI can make a great impression of being empathetic and compassionate it never had and never will have human experiences. Therapy at it's core is about human relation (apart from more cognitive behavioural approaches). Anytime a conversation with an AI is ongoing for a longer period of time it slips into becoming more and more sycophantic, validating anything the user says, which completely defeats the point of therapy.
Furthermore, AI's memory is shocking and it constantly forgets important details, even if the conversation is ongoing.
Lastly, as a therapist I am trained to spot and point out patterns in client's feelings and behaviours and give gentle challenges. This is often so subtle (and again, relies so much on body language, tone and interpersonal intelligence), that AI will never be able to authentically replicate this.

AI: Your perspective on the irreplaceable human elements in therapy is really clear. It sounds like you see AI as a useful tool for certain administrative and preparatory aspects, but the core therapeutic work remains fundamentally human.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as your profession establishes clearer guidelines?

User: It really depends on guidelines that may or may not be put into place in the future. With the way the models currently are, I cannot see a way where I could use them any more than I am already, without breaching a lot of ethical guidelines.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed your own ethical boundaries around AI use in such a professionally sensitive field, and your distinction between tasks where you want efficiency versus genuine collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered everything important.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in a field with such complex ethical considerations, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining professional boundaries while still finding practical applications, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and frustrations you've experienced. Take care!
