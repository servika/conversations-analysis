Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, Claude - go ahead!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work in two creative fields: writing and illustration. I write short stories, primarily, but also poetry. Currently, I am working on a collection of short stories for a book that I am writing. It involves brainstorming, research, and lots of editing. I also sell digital artwork and invitations, using illustrations and media created through various design interfaces. Much of my time is spent refining designs and sourcing/creating images.

AI: That's fascinating - you're working across both written and visual creative mediums. It sounds like you have quite a varied creative process between the storytelling and the commercial design work.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: For my written work, I will often use AI as a sounding board, to help brainstorm ideas, and as a superficial editor. I don't rely on it for the overall editing process, which I prefer to do myself, but I look to it as a first-check. For the art that I sell, I often employ generative AI imaging services (such as Midjourney) and combine it with details I craft. I also use AI to help in the creation of image prompts and for brainstorming more generally.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI in quite different ways across your two creative areas. It sounds like with writing, AI serves more as a collaborator or assistant, while with your visual work, it's actually generating core elements that you then build upon.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes, that's right! I most recently used AI to help in the research of my written work, specifically the history of spinsters, as the short stories I am writing are related to how women exist in the world independently from men and marriage. The AI was very helpful in pulling from several sources and finding unique perspectives that I might otherwise not have found on my own. It allowed me to focus more on the written aspect than the research.

AI: That's a really compelling example - using AI to help you dive deeper into the historical context around spinsters so you could focus your energy on the actual storytelling. It sounds like it opened up research avenues you might not have discovered otherwise.

When you're working with AI in this way - whether it's for research like this or for generating visual elements - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I generally have the main idea already in mind, but I use AI to expand on a topic, or help brainstorm related ideas. For example, if I am creating a series of artwork that features landscapes, I might ask the AI to help me conceptualize the various types of landscapes that exist (e.g., deserts, plains, coastal, etc.) and create descriptions/prompts related to those ideas. The creative decisions are ultimately mine, but AI helps bring them to life.

AI: That's a really clear way to put it - you're the creative director, and AI is helping you execute and expand your vision. It sounds like you maintain creative ownership while using AI as a powerful tool to bring your ideas to fruition.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It's definitely helped expand my creative scope. I've always found it easy to come up with an initial idea, but moving beyond that and building an actual body of work has been challenging. AI has allowed me to consider new concepts and ways of doing things. As it pertains to my writing, I find that I am more able to work on the fine-grained details, such as getting a turn of phrase just right, because I can outsource some of the broader tasks to AI.

AI: That's such an insightful perspective - AI is helping you overcome what sounds like a common creative challenge of expanding beyond that initial spark of an idea. And it's interesting how it's allowing you to focus more on the craft elements you care most about, like perfecting those turns of phrase.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: When I think of AI at its best, it is a tool that helps facilitate broader ideas and eases the burden of life's mundane tasks. I can understand why some feel that it's perhaps a "threat" to artistic endeavours and that it will replace artists in creative mediums. However, I am optimistic that human creativity will always triumph and that AI can work alongside our efforts to create even better and more meaningful work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful and optimistic perspective. It sounds like you see AI as fundamentally complementary to human creativity rather than competitive with it. You mentioned that at its best, AI helps with broader ideas and mundane tasks - that seems to align well with how you're actually using it in practice.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think I will continue to employ it much as I have, using it to assist with my writing and to help create designs. As it improves, I imagine I will consider off-loading more of the editing work, and incorporating more of its visual creations into my designs. Right now, I don't fully trust it to edit a work to completion, and its design work often requires a fair amount of oversight and re-tooling to get right. Hopefully in a few years its refinements will make it an even more useful tool.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're looking for AI to get better at the tasks you're already using it for, rather than fundamentally changing your creative approach. It sounds like you have a pretty clear sense of where the current limitations are and what improvements would be most valuable to you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you expand your creative scope and focus more on the fine-grained craft elements you care about, like perfecting those turns of phrase.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all for today, Claude! Thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative collaborator while maintaining your role as the creative director, and your optimistic view of how human creativity and AI can work together, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you described your process - from using AI for historical research on spinsters to help with your short story collection, to the way you're balancing AI-generated visual elements with your own crafted details. It's clear you've found a workflow that enhances rather than replaces your creative vision.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your short story collection and your design work!
