Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here today as part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I do not have any additional questions.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I occasionally use AI to find out how to properly edit documents in Microsoft Word and PDFs in order to create clean, legible, and professional documents.

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a guide for document formatting and editing. 

Tell me more about what "clean, legible, and professional documents" means to you in your work context.

User: I create certificates of approval for various products made in a solder paste factory. They need to look great for receipt by the customer.

AI: I see - so these certificates of approval are going directly to your customers and represent your company's quality standards. 

When you turn to AI for help with formatting these certificates, what specific challenges are you trying to solve? What happens when you try to format them without AI assistance?

User: Microsoft Word can be very tricky with document formatting. This is especially the case when graphics or tables are introduced. It can cause text to move to undesirable places and become difficult to understand.

AI: That makes complete sense - Word's formatting can be notoriously unpredictable, especially with mixed content like you're describing.

When you ask AI for help with these formatting issues, what does that interaction typically look like? Are you describing the problem you're having, or are you asking for step-by-step instructions, or something else entirely?

User: I generally understand the problem itself, so I ask the AI model directly what I can do to fix the document visually and aesthetically

AI: So you're coming to AI with a clear diagnosis of what's wrong - you know the table is pushing text around or the graphic is causing issues - and you're looking for the specific remedy.

When AI gives you those formatting solutions, how often do they actually work the first time? Do you find yourself going back and forth with follow-up questions, or does it usually nail the fix right away?

User: The tactics suggested by the AI model work the first time approximately half of the time. I usually give it follow up questions until the problem has been solved.

AI: That's a really helpful detail - so it's more of an iterative process where you're troubleshooting together until you get it right.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks related to your certificate creation that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I typically enter the information myself using a prepared Excel file where the data gets entered directly from the Excel file to the certificate of analysis template on another page. This task is simple and intuitive enough that I do not feel the need to use AI.

AI: That's a great distinction - you're comfortable handling the straightforward data entry process yourself, but when Word starts misbehaving with formatting, that's when you bring in AI as your troubleshooting partner.

When you use AI for these formatting issues, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work through the problem step-by-step with AI, or do you tend to ask for a complete solution and then implement it on your own?

User: I describe the specific fault, and then I ask for a way in which this could be avoided. In other words, I normally ask for a complete solution immediately. However, when I troubleshoot further, I normally start asking the AI questions on a step-by-step basis.

AI: So you start by going for the complete fix, but then shift into that collaborative, step-by-step mode when the first solution doesn't quite do the trick.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you use AI for similar tasks, or are you pretty much figuring this out on your own?

User: I have not discussed the usage of AI with my coworkers. So, I am figuring this out on my own.

AI: That's interesting - you're kind of pioneering this on your own without much discussion about it at work.

Can you share a time when using AI for these formatting issues made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was creating a document explaining how to properly package some of my company's solder paste, and the images of the packaged boxes kept moving all around the Word document. I then asked an AI model, and it gave me tips on how to shrink the images to make the document look neater and to make all the text easily findable and legible.

AI: That sounds like a great example of AI helping you create something that really serves its purpose - making sure the packaging instructions are clear and usable.

What made that particular interaction feel satisfying? Was it the fact that the solution worked, or something else about how the AI approached the problem?

User: It was a long document to create, and it took a lot of time. Just having that completed was reliving. It was worth the effort.

AI: I can really hear the relief in that - spending all that time on a complex document and then having the formatting finally come together must have felt like a real accomplishment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially when it comes to document formatting or other aspects of your work?

User: I am not worried about AI taking my job, because it is a very elaborate role that cannot be easily automated.

AI: That confidence in your role's complexity is really interesting. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it for more tasks, or do you think it will stay pretty much focused on these formatting challenges?

User: I do not see the role of AI at my job expanding beyond its current role. It will be focused on the current formatting challenges.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed this iterative troubleshooting approach - starting with asking for complete solutions but then shifting to step-by-step collaboration when needed.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: There is nothing else I can add.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a formatting troubleshooting partner - especially how you've learned to work with it iteratively when the first solution doesn't quite work - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your approach with me today.
