Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for a variety of tasks, but mostly brainstorming and short form writing. Specifically I use it to help me outline powerpoint presentations on general health topics (hydration, mental health, nutrition, etc.), coming up with lists of ideas (party themes, items for a scavenger hunt, words for a themed word search, etc.), and for writing short blurbs (paragraph about X historical event, 5 fun facts about snowflakes, etc.).

AI: That's a nice range of creative and content tasks. Tell me more about your brainstorming process with AI - when you're working on something like party themes or presentation outlines, how do you typically interact with the AI during that process?

User: Most of the time I already have a theme or topic I want to use and have AI help me come up with a creative title or outline. For example, "catchy titles for a family friendly halloween party" or "outline a 15 slide presentation about winter nutrition". Depending on what it gives me I usually ask for changes or give suggestions to refine the responses.

AI: So it sounds like you come in with a clear direction and use AI as a creative partner to develop those ideas further. When you're refining those responses - asking for changes or giving suggestions - what usually prompts you to want something different from what the AI first gives you?

User: The most common issue I run into is lack of creativity and repetition from the model. This improves when my prompt is very specific, but otherwise I end up with repeats between responses and very generic ideas.

AI: That's really interesting - the balance between being specific enough to get creative output but not so narrow that you lose the brainstorming value. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: For making lists of words for word search or crossword puzzles I like to do those primarily myself and just use AI for filling it when I run out of ideas. I also write a lot of "this day in history" content and I always choose the events myself. Asking AI to give me events from a certain day always results in errors with the wrong dates.

AI: That's a great example of knowing where AI's limitations are and working around them. It sounds like you've developed a pretty clear sense of when to rely on your own judgment versus when to bring AI in as backup.

When you are using AI for those tasks - whether it's the brainstorming or the short-form writing - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it the full scope and let it handle things independently?

User: I give it a set of instructions to start and then just see what it does. For the most part I've used AI for the particular task enough that I know what input it needs to be successful.  For example, "write a short paragraph about september, 16 1876 about when [REDACTED]". If I'm not specific enough it will make up something or choose the wrong event. If I'm not happy I do go back and forth, "make it one sentence longer", "try again, don't mention X", or "give me more ideas like X".

AI: That makes sense - you've developed a pretty efficient workflow where you frontload the specificity to get better initial results. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped how you approach these tasks at all?

User: I've been in my current job for a little over a year and they were already using AI to do some of the tasks when I took them over. In meetings we frequently use AI to brainstorm, so it's very common and there's no negative attitudes about using it.

AI: It sounds like you walked into a really AI-friendly environment. That's helpful context.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied: I used AI to help me come up with Halloween party theme ideas and my boss/coworkers chose a couple of them to use for our content.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you succeed in a collaborative way! The fact that your ideas were chosen by the team must have felt validating.

What about on the flip side - can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling frustrated?

User: I tried to use it to batch write a months worth of "this day in history" segments. Despite very specific instructions on word count the paragraphs got shorter and shorter. Like the first two days were good, but then it got lazy and ignored the instructions.

AI: That's such an interesting pattern - the degradation over the course of a longer task. It sounds like AI works well for you in shorter bursts but struggles with consistency across larger batches.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As useful as AI is, I don't see it being able to "take over" my job. What I do blends creativity with a background in healthcare knowledge and that kind of crossover would be difficult to replace.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you see your unique combination of healthcare expertise and creativity as something that gives you an edge. It sounds like you view AI more as a tool that enhances what you can do rather than something that threatens to replace your role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think as AI improves I'll probably use it about the same or a little more often. It definitely presents the opportunity to improve the quality of the content I produce.

AI: That's a really balanced outlook - viewing AI as a way to elevate your work quality rather than fundamentally changing how much you rely on it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've developed such a clear understanding of AI's strengths and limitations - like knowing exactly how specific your prompts need to be and recognizing when tasks like date verification require your human judgment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that sweet spot between specificity and creativity, and how you've learned to work around AI's limitations while leveraging its strengths, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
