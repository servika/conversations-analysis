Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for many many tasks. For example, vocabulary. Sometimes I give a state standard and ask the AI for vocab words that correlate. Other times I provide words and ask for a quick response with definitions, Greek and Latin roots, and sometimes pronunciation. I also use it to create lesson notes for students to record in their notebooks. For grammar I will often have it create multiple choice quizzes and or cloze type activities. For all subject areas (math, ELA, SS, Science) I will have AI create multiple choice quizzes and/or questions I can use to plug-in to a learning game like blooket. I use AI to assist with topic research, lesson planning, science experiment ideas, workflow analysis, data analysis, writing poems or short stories on the go for modeling essay writing. I often use it to determine common misconceptions among students with a standard I am about to teach. I also sometimes use it to help solve math problems or create an answer key.

AI: Wow, you're using AI across such a wide range of teaching tasks! It sounds like it's become quite integrated into your daily planning and instruction.

Tell me more about the vocabulary work you mentioned. When you give AI a state standard and ask for correlating vocab words, how does that process typically unfold?

User: Well for example science. I will give it the standard and ask for vocabulary words students should already know (based on previous grade level standards), and what vocabulary we should be working on at a 5th grade level in order to be successful within the standard. Once I approve the list and make necessary changes, I have the AI put together the definitions, roots, create notes, and sometimes create activities like a concept map or doodle notes.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow you've developed. It sounds like you're actively reviewing and editing what the AI produces rather than just using it as-is.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I try to use AI as much as I can to save on planning time. It is more difficult to use ai on kinesthetic lesson plans as they require knowledge of materials I have in my room as well as the ability to lay everything out step by step and most times with a rubric to follow.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the AI wouldn't know what physical materials you have available or the specific layout of your classroom space.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would say it's a balance of both, but heavier on collaborating throughout the task.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration. What does that back-and-forth process typically look like when you're working through a task together?

User: We might start with the standard itself, then break apart the essential skills, then build mini lessons for each of those skills, then build activities for each of those skills, while also doing vertical research of the standard to determine what they should already know and what they will need to know in 6th grade. This ensures I've covered what is needed in 5th. I will sometimes go back to previous conversations to build on the lesson as I deliver the lessons so that I can create intervention lessons.

AI: That sounds like a really systematic approach - almost like you and the AI are co-designing the entire learning progression together. The fact that you circle back to previous conversations to build interventions shows how iterative that collaboration can be.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues seem to be more skeptical of AI than me. I am much more comfortable using it.

AI: What do you think makes you more comfortable with AI compared to your colleagues? Have their attitudes affected how openly you discuss or share your AI work with them?

User: No, I share my work with AI proudly. It is very efficient. I honestly think they're afraid because they simply don't know how to generate prompts.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The biggest frustration is with lesson or activity layouts. Especially when images are involved. AI struggles to understand those types of requests and often respond with unusable content.

AI: That's really specific feedback about where AI hits its limits for you. When those layout and image situations come up, what do you typically do instead?

User: Create the layouts on my own in Canva. Then copy paste the information from AI to my Canva layout

AI: That's a smart workaround - using AI for content generation and then handling the design yourself. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think every teacher worries about AI takeover, but I don't think this will happen for awhile. I do feel keeping myself up to speed with AI will do nothing but benefit my future within my field regardless of take over areas.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I feel it will evolve to where I can spend more time teaching and less time planning

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your systematic approach to collaborating with AI on curriculum design and how you've found creative workarounds for its limitations with visual layouts.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner in curriculum development, and how you've integrated it so thoroughly across different subject areas, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated learning about your workflow and how you've become such an advocate for AI efficiency in education. Have a great rest of your day!
