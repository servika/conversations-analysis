Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope; ready to go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do a lot of writing - mainly short scripts, and I use it as a support because I'm not fully confident in my writing (grammar, syntax, punctuation) and I like to use it to ensure I'm communicating effectively and with the appropriate punctuation. I also use it for fact-checking and corroborating information in the development stages. Once I decide on an idea, I also use it to help me with dialogue and narratives, when I get stuck and cant seem to be able to progress in my storytelling.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned you're not fully confident in your writing mechanics like grammar and syntax. When you use AI for that support, how does that feel for you as a writer? Does it change your relationship with the writing process itself?

User: Well, I can say that it has made me kind of fall back in love with writing, and the way that it allows for the specific expression of a thought, emotion or observation. I think it has boosted my confidence a little, and lowered the psychological barriers Ive had based on my strength as a writer. Im less reticent to approach writing, and more comfortable exploring ides and crafting narratives knowing that if I hit a roadblock, I have a tool that can help me work around it.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has actually opened up creative possibilities for you rather than replacing your creativity. When you do hit those roadblocks and turn to AI for help with dialogue or narrative progression, what does that interaction typically look like? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth, or asking it to generate options for you to choose from?

User: I prefer to bounce bounce ideas back and forth, because I like to take ownership of them. I dont want to express my original, authentic thoughts. I dont want it to think FOR me, per se; I want it to be a wise sounding board. Kind of like a place where I can probe and ask the questions that i would want to ask of any great author or screenwriter, but would be way to uncomfortable to approach, or take up their time. I like that I can ask the most inane and seemingly obvious question to, yet experience absolutely no recoil. As an introvert, it allows me to not be bridled by my own, self-imposed boundaries.

AI: That's a really compelling way to describe it - like having access to a wise mentor without the social barriers. You mentioned wanting to maintain ownership of your authentic thoughts. Are there certain types of creative decisions or tasks where you draw a clear line and say "this is something I need to do myself, not with AI"? What makes those different?

User: Well, I try to stay always open, but inherent in the writing process is the notion of "falling in love with your own work" - which as students, were told not to do, but I do tend to feel possessive of the core idea or premise of any project. Im not against having AI create everything from "soup to nuts', but a lot of the concepts are built from my life experience, and want AI to help me mold and elevate it. Its very synonymous with a relationship where you dont want your partners identity and existence to not overshadow your own. There is a confidence and pride in the strength of an authentic idea. Thats not to say there wont be instances where Im drawing an absolute blank, and will just let AI have at it. But both of these flows need to coexist for me.

AI: That relationship analogy is really striking - not wanting your partner's identity to overshadow your own. It sounds like you've found a balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while protecting what feels most essentially yours in the creative process.

I'm curious about the workplace side of this. How have your colleagues or clients reacted to your use of AI in your writing work? Has that influenced how openly you discuss or use these tools?

User: Well, I run a small team, and Im the EP on most of the projects, so my clients rely on me to come up with ideas for scripts. While I haven't denounced AI at all, I certainly dont want to communicate, and would not ever communicate, that everything Im doing is heavily reliant on support form AI. My clients have come to me because they trust in MY abilities. If they just wanted AI generated content, its plausible they could do that on their own. I also have other responsibilities in the production process, and there have been instances when as a group, weve been stumped, and have collaboratively used AI in the process, but as a means of ideating that we can bounce off of. There is an artistic element of what we do, and being known as the EP relying on AI would be a branding faux pas. Being the EP who knows how to effectively implement AI is a different story. I think...actually know, my clients would feel great if I bring the skill of "mastering" the technology to the table, but "relying" on it...not so much.

AI: That distinction between "mastering" versus "relying on" AI is really insightful, especially from a leadership perspective. It sounds like there's a strategic element to how you position your AI use.

Can you share a specific time when using AI in your work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation that created that strong reaction?

User: Well, one of the core principles in writing is that: everything has a beginning, a middle and and end. I work on a variety of short form content, but in this instance it happened to be a corporate video, and the team was in total disagreement with how the narrative should close. The kinds of videos are for communicating very specific messaging, and can also include subtle messaging, but none of the suggestions were meshing well with the overarching theme, or the content that preceded it. Eventually we all conceded that wed hit a roadblock and in order to introduce some impartiality and objectivity, we turned to AI. While we didnt fully adopt its output, it got us moving and we were able to customize the idea to our project and get it finished.

AI: That's a perfect example of using AI to break through creative gridlock. It sounds like the impartiality was key - having something outside your team dynamics to spark new thinking.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you integrate these tools into your workflow?

User: Ive actually thought about it quite a bit. I keep coming back to the fact that there is only one human experience. I think people will either respect my vision, or they wont. Repeatedly Ive heard about AI taking over video projects, but I do believe there is a core human element that is receptive to other human elements, that cant be satisfied by a facsimile - for most. A lot of responding to visual stimuli is based on core emotions - which is in no way an exact science. For instance, I can look at a tree on a rainy day, and experience one set of unlimited emotions. I can look at at same tree on a sunny day, and have an entirely different set of responses, either just based on the visual interpretation, or even based on both the visual interpretation and the fact that right before I walked out of the house I had a delicious bite of food, THEN I saw the tree. It isnt formulaic. Theses responses are inherent to the human experience.

AI: That's beautifully put - the idea that your unique human lens and experiences are irreplaceable. The tree example really captures how personal context shapes creative vision in ways that can't be systematized.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops, or as you become more experienced with it?

User: Absolutely, and Im not afraid of the ride. As I understand the capabilities more, I fully expect to integrate into my processes. Developing a level of comfort and understanding outside of the fear-based narratives is key. I see it as additive, not a replacement. I also ironically can envision it as a partner in dealing with very human, employee focused realms, including identifying strengths, teambuilding, task delegation and scheduling based on individual productivity. Really understanding how to incorporate it is a goal.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI as a wise sounding board while protecting the authenticity of your creative vision - and that distinction between "mastering" versus "relying on" AI from a leadership standpoint.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thats all.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative partner while maintaining ownership of your authentic voice, and how you navigate that as a leader, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Ciao

AI: Ciao! Take care!
