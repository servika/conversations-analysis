## Representative Insights

### How Managers & Directors Use AI

1. "Typically I will use the AI summary to assess whether we need to dig into a particular regulation or standard further.  To ensure the AI is correct, I will ask it to provide references to specific clauses so I can confirm what it is saying matches the text in the standard. I'll fully read the scope, introduction, and selected key clauses for myself and check them against what they AI said."
   *— From conversation 00059.md*

2. "Typically I will collaborate with AI at the beginning / middle of the task then complete the task independently. This allows for a thorough review of the output and ensures it has been appropriately reviewed before it is completed. I have not yet found many use cases where I would delegate AI to completely handle a task independently."
   *— From conversation 00091.md*

3. "While I see a risk that AI can replace skillsets for the likes of coding and data administration, the same tool provides skills and learning to become advanced in these areas or enable to create something better than what you would have without it. Therefore I see AI as an enabler of being able to be better at the existing skill sets to come up with a better output, and therefore put the time in to learn how to use these AI tools to provide even more value."
   *— From conversation 00091.md*

4. "I work as a Cybersecurity Manager and use AI to help craft employee emails to my team and correct wording in documents.  I also ask it questions about technical topics I am unfamiliar with and to help me draft meeting agendas and ideas on how to implement change in my team."
   *— From conversation 00093.md*

5. "We have a very stressful environment with tremendous change and I want to always make sure everything from instructions to feedback is crystal clear and using AI has helped with that.  We are encouraged in my organization to implement AI into our work to help us write our emails and make things more efficient."
   *— From conversation 00093.md*

6. "I used AI to help me write the introduction email to my team in my new role I took on as their supervisor [REDACTED].  I gave it what I wanted to say and the AI wrote a professional yet practical message that really reflected the kind of person that I am."
   *— From conversation 00093.md*

7. "I asked it word it in a realistic and down-to-earth manner, which is me.  It used plain language and was clear and to the point."
   *— From conversation 00093.md*

8. "I work as a Restaurant Manager so I often use AI to help me with professional writing. For example, when I write emails to customers I often use AI to rewrite my email to make it sound more professional or when creating a Facebook/Instagram post I would use it help me generate a potential description for the post."
   *— From conversation 00101.md*

9. "I mainly use it for text generation or rewriting. I would never just copy an AI response and use it, I always double check it and make some edits so it is exactly how I like."
   *— From conversation 00101.md*

10. "The owners actually encourage us to use AI, especially in terms of writing something like an email or a description for a post. I would say that most of my coworkers (other managers) use AI in a similar way that I do."
   *— From conversation 00101.md*

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "I would love to use AI to read a standard (for example ISO 6469-3), pull out all the design and test requirements from the standard and place those into a template (excel, word, or something similar) so that we can put them into our requirements management system. This is an extensive copy-paste activity normally and takes a lot of time.  Why I don't do that is the few times I've tried it, AI had trouble reading the PDF files correctly, formatting in the output was not done well (data in the wrong fields), and there are licensing concerns with feeding standards under copyright into an AI"
   *— From conversation 00059.md*

2. "While I see a risk that AI can replace skillsets for the likes of coding and data administration, the same tool provides skills and learning to become advanced in these areas or enable to create something better than what you would have without it. Therefore I see AI as an enabler of being able to be better at the existing skill sets to come up with a better output, and therefore put the time in to learn how to use these AI tools to provide even more value."
   *— From conversation 00091.md*

3. "If I am writing a feedback for an employee, sometimes I feel like I need to have it come directly from what is in my head vice have AI write it for me.  I feel like the personal touch gets missing and want to reduce the risk of something being misconstrued."
   *— From conversation 00093.md*

4. "I use AI  for a variety of different tasks. These tasks can range from summarizing long emails and reports to analyzing data. Due to the risks of AI being inaccurate at times, the work still requires double checking and sensitive tasks are all done manually. Further examples of tasks could be generating ideas on how to optimize revenue, taking a data set and extracting information, or even simply editing responses to ensure they sound professional."
   *— From conversation 00126.md*

5. "I think that no matter how developed AI becomes, there will always need to be a person that can still perform the same tasks. Technology is still greatly limited by potential risks. If there were a power outage or the internet went down, someone still needs to be able to perform the necessary tasks. This is indeed a topic that I've actively considered."
   *— From conversation 00126.md*

6. "As a fairly creative minded person, I personally don't worry about losing my skills because of AI as I still enjoy it and I work with the AI to create social media captions which keeps my skills involved as well as using AI."
   *— From conversation 00134.md*

7. "I do not worry about that, as AI cannot replace my 35 years of experience. There are things that must be learned over time, and not just  fact based."
   *— From conversation 00138.md*

8. "I personally dont believe or worry about AI taking my job. I have hands-on knowledge and expertise and practical aspects of my job that AI cannot replicate. It is more of a time save than anything for me which is great!"
   *— From conversation 00158.md*

## Future Perspectives

1. "We wouldn't want any emails to be sent that include mistakes or could give a bad impression to our  clients and future clients"
   *— From conversation 00124.md*

2. "The company is aware of the potential of AI and its uses in the industry. There is even a specific department dedicated to AI sciences, who help to develop software and begin integrating AI into different areas of interest. For the revenue management department, there is little to no rules or expectations regarding AI use. Essentially, the only expectation is that if we choose to use AI, we had better be accurate. Many of my colleagues are not as savvy with technology and don't rely on AI assistance."
   *— From conversation 00126.md*

3. "Considering all of the advancements and integrations that are already coming out of the AI sciences department, I foresee an even closer relationship working with AI. As accuracy increases and the models become better at interpreting user intents, there will be less need to check their work. Even more time can be saved and much less effort would be required for analytics."
   *— From conversation 00126.md*

4. "We have a small business for which I am the business manager and accountant.  My colleagues are not involved in the AI process at this time, but in the future that may change since I hope to start using AI to create the work schedule."
   *— From conversation 00130.md*

5. "Thanks and good luck, hope I can help in the future too"
   *— From conversation 00158.md*

6. "It is already used with the chatbots and within the platforms we use, so I see it only strengthening and getting smarter, and therefore being even more helpful in the future. Maybe it will be seen almost more like a co-worker/co-creator than a useful tool, if it can really get its head around the brand voice and direction etc..and maybe co-create/collab with the whole business to get all the department's different inputs to become a more strategic partner"
   *— From conversation 00180.md*

7. "I would not rely on the AI to make the menu from scratch, or to help me with ordering food. The AI might do a decent job at producing a menu, but it also may fail to consider the specifics of the expected clients (With allergens, general taste, and menu balance).  I wouldn't ask the AI to help me with tasks related to ordering food because there is no way for the model to know all of the price points, unless I told them. I would have to inform the AI on too much data for it to help me with ordering, so it is easier to do it myself."
   *— From conversation 00190.md*

8. "Again, I believe AI is a great tool to be used in conjunction with people instead of replacing people outright. Perhaps in the future AI will get so good at mimicking humans that they could replace many skills and jobs, but right now I believe maintaining skills in those areas is more important now than ever so that humanity does not become dependent on AI."
   *— From conversation 00212.md*
