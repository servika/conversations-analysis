Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let us begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work at a District Attorney's Office. I mainly use AI on Westlaw to find case law or I'll ChatGPT to spell check emails and any work product I may create for my attorneys. I'll also use ChatGPT to make sentences and legal jargon that I read in case law more easy to understand, especially in older case law.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you with both research and communication aspects of your legal work. 

When you're using AI to simplify older case law and legal jargon, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you decide which parts need clarifying?

User: Well I usually read the entire court decision on my own first. Then I'll go back read it a second time and stop at each sentence I may not understand, copy it, paste it on ChatGPT, then ask it to simplify it. I'll continue this until I understand the entire case law. If the entire decision is written in very difficult English, I'll copy and paste the entire thing and ask Chatgpt to make it simpler to understand.  It really just depends on whether I understand it the first time I read it. If there is only a few sentences then I'll simplify that, if I don't understand most of the decision, ill ask AI to simplify everything.

AI: That's a very methodical approach. It sounds like you're making the decision about what needs simplification based on your own comprehension as you go.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer writing my arguments for motions myself. A lot of the time these arguments are the same. The only thing that changes usually is the defendant, there circumstances, and whether or not we want to argue to the court to grant them mental diversion. Still, I feel a little more satisfied with myself when I carry out this kind of work and I feel more happy with my life knowing the time I put into my education is paying off and I'm not just using AI to do my work. I also feel more safe knowing I'm writing it and not an AI which im still not completely confident

AI: That really resonates - it sounds like there's both a personal satisfaction element and a confidence factor in your decision to write those arguments yourself.

When you mention not being completely confident in AI for that type of work, what specifically concerns you about relying on it for motion arguments versus the other tasks where you do use it regularly?

User: I think the legal field requires more thinking and certainty.  Victims' lives are at stakes. I think humans need to be at the forefront still in making sure that we are taking care of our fellow human beings. Versus relying on AI for spell check or helping you find case law(as long as I verfiy) is not so dangerous and has the potential to lose a case for someome.

AI: That distinction makes a lot of sense - the stakes really do matter when it comes to how much responsibility you're willing to place on AI.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with AI for sure. I will always do the work and never rely on AI 100 percent event with spell checking and case law finding. I need be in charge at the end of the day and have the final decision.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it keeps you in control while still getting the benefits of AI assistance.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We are told not to use AI for drafting. Spell check is okay, so I make sure to follow all the rules when it comes to using AI. My workplace sees the benefits but is also cautious of the potential dangers of overreliance.

AI: It sounds like your workplace has found a middle ground - recognizing benefits while setting clear boundaries.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was satisfied for sure when I am able to find case law pretty easily using Westlaw. Normally, it would take me longer, but having that tool definitely speeds things up which frees my day for other projects.

AI: That efficiency gain sounds like it really opens up your workflow. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: not really, I have not put much thought into it.

AI: That's fair - it's not something everyone feels the need to focus on actively.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: With AI improving, I definitely see it being used more and more at work. We could probably use it for our trial calendars and any Excel sheets we may have.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining human responsibility in high-stakes legal decisions while still leveraging AI for efficiency gains.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No im all good

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with human judgment in legal work, especially given the high stakes involved, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were about explaining your decision-making process and the boundaries you've established. Have a great rest of your day!
