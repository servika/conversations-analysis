Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI for searching the internet faster and easier to find specific information, as well as researching topics that I may not be familiar with while working. I have also done some numerical analysis with AI in order to keep numbers straight while designing or computing

AI: That's really helpful to understand. It sounds like AI serves as both a research assistant and analytical tool for you. 

When you mention using AI for numerical analysis to "keep numbers straight" - can you walk me through what that typically looks like? What kind of designing or computing work are you doing where this comes up?

User: SO I use AI in order to help me with CAD. I use solidworks which has a noticeably bad help FAQ so I often have to resort to seraching online for information related to what I am doing. For instance, If I want to design something like an inset screw hole and need a refresher then I will search online how best to do so since there are often many ways to achieve the same result. As for the numerical analysis stuff, I sometimes have to make complex designs where the dimensions are in inches and solidworks doesn't effectively add them up. I can take a screenshot of the model with the dimensions and ask it a question like "do these numbers add up to 40? and is the short side at least a third smaller than the tall side"

AI: That's fascinating - you've found some really practical ways to work around Solidworks' limitations. The screenshot approach for dimension checking is clever.

When you're searching for information about CAD techniques like that inset screw hole example, how do you typically interact with the AI? Are you asking it to search and summarize results for you, or are you more collaborating with it to work through the problem step by step?

User: Currently I am asking it to find useful results for me. I find that if I work through it with the AI then it can sometimes present incorrect information as factual with no indication that it is actually incorrect. I have had a couple instances where it led me down a wild goose chase because it presented something to me as being true but it wasn't, or it was for an older version of solidworks

AI: That's a really important insight - you've learned to be strategic about when to trust AI's direct knowledge versus when to have it help you find external sources. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned being cautious about AI's direct technical knowledge - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I guess I would not defer to AI if it is something like finding dimensions for a part. If I need something like an inner diameter for a pipe I currently search for the dimension instead of ask the AI what it is. This is because there are often multiple variants or types of the same dimension and I can't yet rely on the AI to present them all to me truthfully, or to interpret them and find the exact one I am looking for.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you need precision with those specifications, and there's real risk if you get the wrong variant. It sounds like you've developed a clear sense of where AI's limitations could cause problems in your work.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For example, when you're having it search for CAD techniques or check those dimensions in screenshots - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a specific request and then take the results to work independently?

User: I will give it a specific request and then take the results and work independently. However, I do keep the chat open as I will often build a chat history throughout the day and can refer to questions I had earlier in the day just in case

AI: That's an interesting approach - building up that chat history as a reference throughout your workday. It sounds like you're treating it almost like a research log you can go back to.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you use it similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: Yes others around me use it similarity but we all kind of have our own methods. I like to double check things often, but others may skip that, or they may find the actual answer first and then use AI to double check

AI: Interesting - so there's a spectrum of verification approaches among your colleagues. Some are more trusting of AI's direct answers while you prefer to verify independently first.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: What can frustrate me a lot is when I ask a simple question like how to revolve threads around a shaft and the AI will give me pages and pages of guides. I often times just want a quick and easy explanation that I can build upon through my own research then having the AI spit out a bunch of instructions at me

AI: That's really relatable - you're looking for a concise starting point, not an overwhelming tutorial when you just need to get oriented on a topic.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given your CAD work?

User: No i have not considered that much, primarily because there are so many moving parts that I don't think AI will be able to take over with current limitations on memory and efficiency. Luckily, half of CAD is the creative aspect and that is much harder to replicate

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - the creative and complex problem-solving aspects of CAD work seem like they'll remain distinctly human for the foreseeable future.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the tools improve, or are you pretty satisfied with how you're incorporating it now?

User: I hopefully see myself leaning on the AI more, but I need it to be less incorrect in order to do so.

AI: That makes perfect sense - accuracy is really the key barrier for you to rely on it more heavily.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on developing verification strategies and how you've learned to work around AI's limitations while still finding valuable ways to use it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Sure, I will say that I think currently AI models are far too agreeable. Sometimes I want actual pushback from a model when developing an idea or working on revising something. That pushback forces you to step back and see the bigger picture. Without it, it is far too easy to get sucked into the minutae and miss overarching errors.

AI: That's a really insightful point - you're highlighting something important about the collaborative dynamic. The idea that AI being too agreeable can actually be a hindrance to good problem-solving is fascinating. You want that constructive friction that helps you think more critically about your approach.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about verification strategies, the need for more accuracy, and especially that point about wanting more constructive pushback from AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me today.

User: thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Thanks again for participating - your perspectives were really valuable. Have a great rest of your day!
