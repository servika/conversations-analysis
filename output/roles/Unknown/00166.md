Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions yet.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Not too much. I use it for sorting emails occasionally and I've used it for legal research a few times. As for a typical workday, I will occasionally use it to draft a form letter which I will then edit.

AI: That's helpful context. When you mention using AI for legal research, can you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: We had a trial of an AI specializing in legal tasks. You ask it a legal question (such as a bankruptcy question) and it would provide a decent answer. I've also used Grok for a similar purpose. For example, asking the AI to calculate which exemptions should be used in a chapter 7 if a person has lived in multiple states over the last 4-5 years.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you've experimented with different AI tools for specific legal calculations and research. 

When you're working on these types of legal questions, do you find yourself double-checking the AI's work, or do you generally trust the responses you get? What's your verification process like?

User: I always double check. I never trust the AIs answer without my own verification.

AI: That makes a lot of sense given the stakes in legal work. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Looking up cases I do myself. I've noticed AIs are terrible looking them up and prone to hallucination.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making between case lookup and other types of legal research. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: More collaboration, I haven't really worked with giving it a complete task, other than to write a memo or the like.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds quite deliberate. When you say you collaborate with AI, can you walk me through what that back-and-forth typically looks like? For instance, when you're working on something like drafting that form letter you mentioned earlier?

User: Fairly typical. An example would be "please write an email to [REDACTED] letting them know the automatic stay on XYZ property was modified yesterday and to please conact me ASAP."

AI: That's a clear example, thank you. It sounds like you give it specific, concrete instructions and then edit from there.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your firm using it similarly, or do you see different approaches?

User: I have one partner, he is distrustful of AI and never uses it. I have a colleague (different firm) who wants it to be used for more and more and he has influenced me a bit.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - having those two different perspectives around you. 

Can you tell me more about how your colleague from the other firm has influenced you? What kinds of additional uses has he encouraged you to explore?

User: Calendar integration, letting AI run my calendar. Though so far, I have been resistant as mistakes could be costly.

AI: That resistance makes complete sense given the potential consequences. The contrast between using AI for drafting that you can easily review versus something like calendar management that could create real scheduling conflicts is striking.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have been satisfied with basic memos, emails etc. I haven't really been frustrated except seeing that it is still quite limited with case research.

AI: You've mentioned case research limitations a couple of times - that seems to be a real pain point. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: If AI was actually fully reliable in certain areas, I would be happy to delegate and focus my skills to the areas where they are needed.

AI: That's a pragmatic perspective - being willing to delegate when the reliability is there, but staying engaged where it isn't yet.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or staying fairly cautious?

User: I would stay cautious but hope to expand. If it becomes reliable in areas like docket management and case research, I would gladly let it handle those areas.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the balance between cautious adoption and the potential for delegation when reliability improves - that pragmatic approach to distinguishing between high-stakes and lower-stakes tasks seems really important in legal work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Thank you all done.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the careful balance between leveraging AI's current capabilities while maintaining appropriate skepticism - especially around case research and high-stakes tasks - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
