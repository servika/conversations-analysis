Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great. Let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in customer service, so the bulk of my AI usage is allocated to making communications with customers easier. I can rely on LLMs to save me time with things like emails, texts, or pre-planning talking points for a phone conversations.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using AI for those customer communications - like emails or preparing talking points - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you? How do you go about working with the AI to create those communications?

User: It can vary depending on the urgency and importance of a given interaction, but generally I will outline my thoughts in an abstract way and ask the model to edit and structure them into whatever communication medium is needed.

AI: That's interesting - you mention that urgency and importance can change your approach. Can you tell me more about that? How does your process differ when something is more urgent or important versus routine?

User: I would give more details to the model and commit to more editing when a conversation is urgent or if the customer is significant -- this can be vendors that we frequently do reciprocating business with, or customers that have larger accounts. If I need to send a message to my colleague about a meeting and give a quick rundown of relevant information, I would be more abstract because the end product doesn't need to be very polished either way.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - tailoring your level of detail based on the stakes involved. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your customer service role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Honestly no, I think there's a certain threshold where handling something myself is more efficient, like smaller tasks that physically typing out instructions would take longer than just completing manually, or tasks where I have very intentional goals and would likely spend more time editing an adequate AI response. Otherwise, AI would likely be part of my communication process.

AI: That's a really practical way to think about it - weighing the time it takes to instruct the AI versus just doing it yourself. When you do use AI for your communications, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it the initial request and let it handle things independently?

User: I'm definitely more of a collaborative user. Like I said previously, I like to outline my thoughts, then ask the model to organize. Most of the time, I do light editing to adjust the voice/phrasing into something closer to my own, or follow up with the model to change details.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it works well for you. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any guidance, encouragement, or maybe hesitation from others about incorporating AI into customer service tasks?

User: In my experience, there's been some hesitancy from other workers. I've never been told outright to not use AI or anything, but it's certainly not talked about or explored formally or informally. I may be the only person on or staff of 10-20 to incorporate AI into my work. However, there may be others using it and just not discussing it.

AI: That's really insightful - being potentially the only one openly using AI in that environment. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I use AI a lot, so I don't really get frustrated because I know what to expect. My most satisfying achievement using AI is definitely my email template system. I compiled several frequent email requests and created drafted templates for common responses using AI. Overall this has probably saved me hours of work.

AI: That email template system sounds like a really smart solution! I'm curious about how you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI is helping you so much with communications. Is this something you actively consider - keeping your own writing and communication abilities sharp?

User: Yes. I actually worry that my own skills are degrading because my instinct is to use AI for many things. I haven't found a great solution to this problem.

AI: That's a really honest reflection, and I imagine others might share that concern. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, differently, or are you thinking about setting any boundaries?

User: I'm not thinking about setting boundaries yet. I would use it more, but right now I think I have reached a capacity that the models can handle while still being helpful. Maybe someday AI would be even better at writing where I wouldn't have to edit them as heavily, or be able to develop training plans for new employees, or exercises to keep current employees skills sharp, or write copy for outbound emails etc. If that was the case, I would use it more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest perspective about worrying that your skills might be degrading - that's such a real concern that many people probably grapple with.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being a collaborative AI user, creating that email template system, and navigating being potentially the only one using AI in your workplace will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candor throughout our conversation. Have a great rest of your day!
