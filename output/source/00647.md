Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here today as part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So my job involves working directly with foster families and foster children. while I don't have any direct uses for AI, I mainly use it for creative inspiration. for instance, i am always looking for craft, activity or game ideas to play with the children while they are in my care, and using AI, i can find new ideas that are specifically tailored  to each child. especially if im working with multiple children with different behavioral issues, likes and dislikes, i can input these facts and have something else work the details out for me, or even come up with something i have never heard of.  I also like to use AI for my administrative tasks, such as email mockups and lesson plans

AI: That's really interesting - you've found some creative ways to incorporate AI into your work with foster children. 

Tell me more about how you go about getting those tailored activity ideas. When you're inputting information about the children's different needs and preferences, what does that process look like for you?

User: My main priority is always privacy when it comes to the children. But after I get to know the children and discover what types of activities I think would be beneficial, i describe the task as more of a brainstorming project than a simple question and answer. Lets say i have two children, a boy and a girl, and i want a fun Halloween craft project. I know my boy cannot have access to scissors due to behavioral issues, and my girl is not a fan of coloring. they both have loved playing with sand during sensory play, so i may include that detail too. the AI will generate ideas for me that factor all of these aspects in, and we can work together to plan out a craft!

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful approach, especially how you prioritize privacy while still getting personalized suggestions. I like how you describe it as working together with the AI to plan things out.

When you say you work together with the AI on planning a craft - what does that back-and-forth collaboration typically look like? Are you refining the ideas, asking follow-up questions, or something else?

User: I find that I can refine better than I can design. So, if Im stuck on an idea, i use AI as sort of my jumping off point. I find that the suggestions AI presents is more general, so using that as a base, i will then use the information i have about the children to personalize it. maybe we have a good idea, i tailor it to the kids but one element is missing, or there is one part I can't quite figure out. I will then go back to the AI and see if we can work together to  make it complete.

AI: That's a really insightful way to describe your process - using AI as a jumping off point and then personalizing from there. It sounds like you've developed a good sense of where AI excels versus where your expertise with the children really matters.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Actually, I more so wish the opposite. Because everything I do is so personal and hands-on, there is not a lot of room for AI in my profession. Its more of a tool than a replacement. However, i do wish AI could handle some of the more tiring administrative tasks.  Working with foster children means a lot of paperwork... and while ai can assist in writing and collaborating, it cannot fill out an incident report for me, nor can it complete my monthly hourly report.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the hands-on, personal nature of your work with the children really does require your direct involvement and expertise. It sounds like you see AI as a helpful tool within the constraints of what's possible in your field.

When you do use AI for those administrative tasks like email mockups and lesson plans, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: For those tasks, I will let the AI do as much as it can. I tend to make my own revisions after it has completed the task for me, rather than going back and forth until I like it.

AI: That's an interesting difference in how you approach different types of tasks - more collaborative for the activity planning but more delegated for the administrative work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or policies around AI use in your organization?

User: There isn't much discourse around AI in my profession, at least to my knowledge. I think the conversations surrounding AI are more of how it may or may not be affecting the children who have access to it, rather than the workplace. I think at because each day in this profession is so personalized, it really depends on what needs the family and you as a worker need at that time. I am curious to see how the conversation evolves as AI becomes more and more mainstream.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about how the focus is more on AI's impact on the children rather than workplace applications. It makes sense given the individualized nature of your work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: during my first year working full time, i began working with a foster family with two autistic children. I was struggling a lot with their behavioral issues, so i turned to AI for some problem solving. I described a scenario where the kids were fighting over a toy and i could not figure out how to make it stop. The AI kept giving me very general pieces of advice, things i had already tried and knew were not the right approach with these children. it was a time where i felt a block with technology. i realize now that i was not giving the chatbot enough information but even when i would point out an error or repetition it did not seem to recognize that

AI: That sounds like a really challenging situation - both dealing with the behavioral issues and feeling like the AI wasn't understanding the complexity of what you were facing. It's interesting that you mention realizing later that you might not have been giving enough information, but also that it didn't seem to recognize when you pointed out errors.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your work?

User: Maybe not a skill persay, but one of the things i truly love about this job is the connections you foster with the kids, and i believe that taking the time to plan these thoughtful activities for/with them is a great way to make those connections. I think that if we begin to mass produce lesson plans and schedules, we aren't honing our "skill" of connecting and helping our clients

AI: That's a really profound point about the connection between thoughtfully planning activities and building relationships with the children. It sounds like you see that personal investment in the planning process as integral to your role.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops or as your field potentially adapts to it?

User: I really wish i had a clear answer on that. What I do know is that i would like to envision us using ai to create more platforms to help people in my profession connect with eachother. One thing that people dont understand is that working with foster children is not easy. we see and deal with a lot of issues that are heartbreaking, and they can be a lot for us to process too. currently there are not a lot of resources for us to get help or support, and if we were to adopt AI in any capacity, i would hope it could be for this.

AI: That's such an important perspective - using AI to help build support networks for people doing incredibly challenging and emotionally demanding work. It sounds like you've identified a real gap in resources for people in your profession.

Those are all the questions I had prepared, and you've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the personal, hands-on nature of your work with foster children creates both opportunities and limitations for AI use, and your vision for using AI to support the workers themselves.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I found that when trying to use my Ai for working training it was VERY hit or miss. somethings it got absolutely incorrect while other times it gave me great insight. Just to consider..... thank you for listening!

AI: Thank you so much for sharing that additional insight about the inconsistency with training materials - that's really valuable information for us to know about. And thank you for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly throughout our conversation. 

Your perspective on working with foster children and how AI fits into such deeply personal, relationship-based work has been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how thoughtful you were in describing both the possibilities and the limitations you've encountered.

Take care, and thank you again!
