Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI basically daily. I am an Early Years Educator, and I take observations daily of the children's learning. These observations must be written with the activity the child has undertaken, what skills they have learned from it, and any next steps for learning or any ideas for extending the learning. There's a pretty specific format. I have fed an AI examples of my own personal observations as an example template, and the AI now uses this template to write my observations for me with me giving it my bullet point notes on what happened. It saves me SO MUCH TIME. Before it took me 30 minutes to complete one, now it's not even 5. Similarly, I use AI to help me prepare progress reports and end of year reports. I use it often to come up with ideas of future activities to undertake with children, and it very helpfully prepares the learning objectives for me too. It's been very handy indeed.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become deeply integrated into your documentation process. The time savings you're describing are really significant - from 30 minutes down to 5 minutes per observation.

Tell me more about that process where you feed the AI your bullet point notes. What does that interaction typically look like?

User: Now that the AI chatbot has my template ready, I copy and paste my notes from my ipad directly into the AI. I will give it the child's first name only, where the activity took place, and the very basic details of the interaction and activity. The AI fills in all the skills learnt for me, though I do check it and read it thoroughly to make sure that it is accurate and that there are no hallucinations, which does happen sometimes.

AI: That's a really clear workflow. You mentioned that hallucinations do happen sometimes - can you walk me through what that looks like? How do you catch them, and what kinds of inaccuracies tend to come up?

User: Occasionally in the AI's efforts to me super helpful and create a good observation, the AI will occasionally add in things like quotes from the children, like "Look what I did", or "this is so much fun", which just didn't happen and I did not write. It will also add in slight details such as "you were fantastic at this..." or "you showed great confidence..." which also just isn't true, and I did not indicate that. I catch them by proof reading the AI outputs instead of blindly copy and pasting. I also find myself deleting the MANY MANY em-dashes, no one uses the em-dash in real life, and it's super obvious that it's AI generated if I leave them in there so I delete them.

AI: That's really insightful - the fabricated quotes and added details that weren't in your notes, plus those telltale em-dashes! It sounds like you've developed a good eye for spotting these patterns.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your role as an Early Years Educator that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Not so much, being an Early Years Educator is very busy physically, and there is so much paperwork at the end of the day, it's a relief when I can just use AI to do that kind of hard work for me when my brain is already fried from the day.

AI: I can really hear how valuable that relief is after a demanding day. You mentioned the physical demands and having a "fried" brain by the time you get to paperwork.

When you're using AI for these tasks, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more collaborating back-and-forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it your notes and let it handle the task independently?

User: It's collaborative when it hallucinates or embellishes details. I'll give it a little reminder like "Hey, I didn't say this" or "remove this detail you've just made up". I suppose it is more collaborative at the beginning, having to feed it templates and details to get the observation just right. I like it to use my style of writing so that my work doesn't *look* AI generated, there's a bit of stigma around it, I don't tell my colleagues that I use it.

AI: That's really interesting - the stigma piece and keeping it private from colleagues. Can you tell me more about that workplace dynamic? What do you think drives that stigma in your setting?

User: A lot of people in this field believe that if you need an AI to do the work for you, then you shouldn't be doing it in the first place. Some people also claim that it's not very personal, parents like a nice little personalised observation and report on their children, which I understand. However, I see it like, I've already done the work, we did the activity, and now parents are getting MORE observations of their children because my output has increased. I've also had praise on the quality of my written work, I suppose I'd feel a little silly if they realised that it was actually an AI that wrote it for me!

AI: That tension you're describing is really compelling - the idea that you're actually able to provide MORE observations to parents because of the efficiency gains, versus the perception that it's less personal. And then there's that mixed feeling about receiving praise for the writing quality.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I am more satisfied than frustrated. One example is writing my end of year reports for my children at work. They take so long, looking at a years worth of learning, and condensing that down into one small report. It takes SO LONG. What I did this year was, I fed an AI the observations with copy/paste, and gave the AI a template example of my previ0ous years end of term report and asked it to generate a report for me. It can be quite frustrating again when it adds details that are embellished or just not true, I always need to be cautious of that, because accidentally providing a parent a report of fake news just wouldn't be ok. Again, the MANY em-dashes are always frustrating.

AI: The frustration with those embellishments is really understandable, especially when it's parent-facing documents where accuracy is so critical. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yeah I absolutely do consider that. I do worry that using it too often for this kind of work will slow my brain down a little, because I haven't done my "own" paper work the old way for so long, I'm worried that my own observations and reports just would not be up to par. I also worry that if I write my own, someone will notice the difference in quality! Which is a little silly, I did use my own language and observations as the template after all.

AI: That's such a thoughtful reflection - the worry about your skills atrophying, but also that almost paradoxical concern that your own writing might not be "good enough" compared to the AI version, even though it's based on your template and observations.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm not sure how well it will fit into education. I am aware that many of my colleagues do use it, though not many admit it. I think that parents and management might be concerned about privacy issues, even though I never share any PII, first names only. But, the reality is that we're now starting to be overloaded with paperwork that it seems like using AI might be inevitable. It's also GREAT for coming up with learning and activity ideas, not just paperwork. Sometimes it's hard to think of new or original ideas.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that tension between the efficiency gains and the workplace stigma, and how you're navigating the balance between maintaining your skills while managing an overwhelming paperwork load.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of using AI in Early Years Education - from the time savings and increased output to the challenges with hallucinations and workplace dynamics - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the complexities you're navigating. Take care!
