**Transcript ID:** AI: That's really specific - so when you're asking about ""Ghee

---

" the AI might think you're asking about the letter "G" or some other completely unrelated thing. And it sounds like this happens particularly with items that have foreign names.

How do you think about maintaining your product knowledge in areas where AI could potentially help you learn more? Is building up that familiarity with different products something you actively consider?

User: There are 60,000 or more products in our store, and we are in an area with a large international population. Ghee I know from culinary experience, but there are too many items to be familiar with them all or to recall on a second's notice. If I am curious about a product, I might search for more information in my off-time if I remember what I had been looking earlier.

AI: Wow, 60,000 products and serving a diverse international community - that really puts the challenge in perspective. It makes complete sense why you'd turn to AI for those quick answers about unfamiliar products.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it continuing to help in this same way, or do you think there might be other ways it could be useful for your work?

User: I don't see it evolving into other areas. This is all we can use it for.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you navigate those 60-second decisions with such a vast product inventory and diverse customer base - that's a really unique use case that highlights both the potential and the limitations of AI in fast-paced retail environments.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for quick product substitutions in such a time-pressured environment, especially the challenges with voice recognition and foreign product names, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
