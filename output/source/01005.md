Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I do not have any further questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI has become an increasingly large part of my workday. I use it for the following tasks:
* Refining emails
   * If I am composing a new email, I begin by writing an outline email and ask for it to be improved. I also ask if there is any information that the AI believes would be useful for me to add.
   * If I am replying to an email chain, I input the conversation to date into the AI prompt, and then write an outline of how I would like to respond, and ask the AI to improve it for me
      * In all cases, I usually have to edit these email responses to ensure that they firstly sound like they have come from a human, and secondly have the exact tone that it looks and feels like it has come from me.

AI: That's really helpful context about your email workflow. I can see you've developed a specific approach where AI helps with the initial drafting but you maintain control over the final tone and voice.

You mentioned that AI has become an "increasingly large part" of your workday. Beyond emails, what other tasks do you find yourself turning to AI for?

User: Thank you, I accidentally submitted my answer before I was finished. This is because different AI prompts are submitted on pressing the enter key, and others by pressing shift and the enter key.

Other ways in which I use AI include:
* Creating and defining the company strategy
   * As the founder and COO of a start-up, my role involves defining, creating and amending the company strategy. In order to develop the strategy, I provide AI a prompt that includes an in-depth overview of the company, our wider goal, target market, research that we have done to date, and ask it to help shape a strategic position. I sometimes find the responses slightly generic, but they tend to give a good overview
* Marketing strategy
   * I use AI to develop a marketing plan and strategy
      * I provide the AI models with the same in-depth company overview, explain the current approach, the time available to put into marketing, and ask for advice and marketing plans for certain time periods.
* Content creation
   * I have started using AI to generate content. This tends to be graphics and infographics to support the marketing plan.
   * I rely heavily on AI to create captions, blog posts and thought pieces. I always provide a lot of information, but use AI to structure and refine my writing
* Market research and competition
   * I use AI to provide an overview of the wider markets relevant to my company and competitors in the space, both direct and indirect
* Sales and pricing
   * I have used AI to help understand the pricing of products and how that fits into the wider landscape 
* Finances, taxes, and shares
   * I use AI to help me understand the financial aspects of running a business, how things like shares, vesting shares, options, etc. work. I have used this to help create packages and deals with early starters. 
   * I also use AI to better understand how the tax system works, for example, the use of R&D credits, to be able to fund our start up
* Grant finding and writing
   * I use AI to both find grants, but also help me write the applications and make sure I am hitting the target points that the assessors are looking for.

AI: Wow, you're using AI across virtually every aspect of running your startup - that's quite comprehensive. It sounds like you've really integrated it into the core operations of your business.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that sometimes the strategy responses feel "slightly generic," and that you always edit emails to sound more human and match your tone. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Once I have built a rapport with a contact, I tend to steer clear of AI. It feels more disengenuous, and that building a relationship with another human, who you are likely to interact with in the real world, should be built on true human-human interactions.
I never use AI to carry out the final tweaks, as it seems to find it difficult to capture the correct tone and feel completely.
There are no tasks that I leave fully to AI, as I believe it is important to have a strong understanding of the tasks that are being carried out, and that it is very important not to make catastrophic mistakes through a lack of understanding.
I do not use AI to make final decisions, to make legal decisions, or to advise on safety regulations relating to the product.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - the distinction you make about rapport and genuine human relationships is particularly interesting. It sounds like authenticity in relationships is important to you.

When you do use AI for these various tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I never delegate complete tasks, I like to provide an overview of the work I have done first and ask for opinions, improvements or a starting point. I then make edits, send it back through the AI and work in an iterative pattern. I find that often, at some point, the responses move further away from what I was originally looking for. Sometimes I feel that this is due to poor prompt writing, and other times I feel this is model failure. Sometimes I will go back to an early iteration and try again; other times I take the best iteration and finish the work myself.

AI: That iterative approach sounds like a real partnership where you're guiding the process throughout. It's interesting that you notice when the responses start to drift away from your original vision - that seems to require you to stay quite engaged and evaluative.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? As a founder and COO, I imagine you might be setting some of the tone around AI use for others as well.

User: My other colleagues are more on the product development and tech side of things; they do use AI when creating basic code for the software of the product, but have made it clear that it still requires a lot of hand-holding, editing, and bug fixing. The developers need to have an extremely good understanding of the software and firmware they are creating, and we cannot rely on AI for this solely yet. I am beginning to work with 2 marketing and advertising colleagues, and I do not particularly like that they rely heavily on AI, as I feel I send them a brief that I have spent a good quantity of time focusing on, and they run it through an AI to create their ideas. I could do this myself, and it makes me feel as though their work is less valuable. Additionally, it takes more time for me to ensure the outside team understand the product, the goal, the market and the key messaging than it does for me to explain it to the AI. It becomes time-consuming to send the outside team the brief, have them run it through an AI, adding their own spin on things, and then they edit it, often editing out some of the important technical content that they do not understand, and then send that back to me to further edit, and then I run it back through an AI. As a team, we are currently deciding whether or not to keep them on. As AI is improving, the team is beginning to try to understand how much of the work we can do in-house.

AI: That's a really revealing contrast - you're comfortable using AI as a tool when you maintain deep understanding and control, but you're frustrated when external colleagues seem to use AI as a substitute for that understanding. It sounds like there's a difference between AI enhancing expertise versus potentially replacing it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt particularly satisfied when I used AI to create a visual representation of a LinkedIn post that I wanted. I had a vision that I did not have the skills to create, and instead of having to relay it to the external team and wait days or weeks for a response, I was able to get a good enough image that I could edit to be excellent within 1 hour. Equally, I have since used it for similar workflows and have been frustrated at the image generation quality and lack of ability to follow simple requests, such as add a raised flower bed to the outside of the property. Or ensure the cable is plugged into a standard 3-pin socket rather than a dedicated 7kW EV charger.

I have also been frustrated when supplying an AI with a large amount of information and asking for it to be compressed or used as a guide for certain strategies. The AI fails to handle such large quantities of information, and the outcome becomes quite tangential to the initial prompt.

AI: That satisfaction with the visual creation really stands out - having that immediate creative control versus waiting on external teams sounds empowering. But those specificity issues with image generation and information processing seem like real limitations when you need precision.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, it is something I actively consider and discuss at length with friends and colleagues. 

I believe those who can use AI to assist and further their productivity will remain necessary and important to the success of the wider company. Those who only use AI will begin to fall short and will be replaced. AI is an extremely powerful tool; however, it does not take away from true understanding, deep knowledge and the ability to apply the results in the real world. I do think that it is a threat to a large number of very specific jobs. A lot of business is building relationships, understanding real-world problems and solving these problems effectively and efficiently. I plan to use AI to enhance skills that I do not have, such as content creation and visual design, and use it to help signpost me to important information quickly, but not rely on it for all of my problem-solving and understanding. 

I am very happy for AI to do them jobs that I feel take a lot of time, such as refining and editing emails and grants. However, I expect I will continue to edit and check over these outputs before using them.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - using AI as a productivity multiplier while maintaining your core expertise and judgment. The distinction you make between using AI versus only using AI seems central to how you're thinking about this.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine there will be a closer relationship between me and the AI tools that I use. I expect it will help me drive strategy, determine how to work with colleagues, and increase my productivity. I imagine I will more or less use AI as a continuous consultant, which has a much broader knowledge and understanding than I do in most topics. I will then use this broad knowledge to apply it to my own business. I expect it will help our company keep our team small and agile for longer.

AI: That vision of AI as a "continuous consultant" with broad knowledge that you can apply to your specific context is fascinating - it really captures that collaborative dynamic you've described throughout our conversation.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the difference between using AI to enhance expertise versus replace it, and how that plays out in your frustrations with external teams.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while preserving human expertise and authentic relationships will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes and frustrations - that kind of honest feedback is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are actually being used in the real world. Have a great rest of your day!
