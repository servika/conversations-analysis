Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: There are two ways I typically use AI during work. First, I use it to draft things that are mostly repetitive but I can't just reuse existing things. The most frequent thing I do is write rubrics with AI. I tell it the total points, give it the assignment, and let it draft. I also use it to draft or proofread emails to students. The second thing I do is having the AI generate ideas for me. For example, I help students with researching. Sometimes they have their topic, but it's in plain language or a topic I don't need anything about. I use AI to generate a list of suggested keywords and combinations to use to search in the library databases.

AI: That's really helpful - I can see you're using AI in some very specific ways. You mentioned writing rubrics and generating research keywords. 

Tell me more about that rubric creation process. What does that interaction typically look like between you and the AI?

User: In my prompt I'll include the total points I want the assignment to be worth, a copy of the assignment, and the class i'm writing it for. I always say if it's an [REDACTED] course, for example. Then I ask it to write me a rubric. Once it's given me a draft I'll make adjustments going back and forth with the AI to adjust or correct.

AI: Interesting - so you're doing some back-and-forth refinement. When you're making those adjustments with the AI, what kinds of changes do you typically find yourself asking for?

User: The AI has a tendency to use language that's too academic for the students I'm teaching.

AI: That makes a lot of sense. So you're having to translate it into more accessible language for your students.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think there's a lot AI could help me with that I prefer to do myself. I don't use AI at all for student feedback, even though there are certain things I could draft with it, because I prefer to make myself engage fully with the process by doing it myself. I expect students to not use AI to write their assignments wholesale (although they're welcome to use it during the research stages) so I feel compelled to do my feedback without using AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - maintaining that parallel standard between what you expect from students and what you do yourself. 

Tell me more about that decision to engage fully with the feedback process. What does that mean to you?

User: I read the submission in full, and I write up the feedback to the student without using AI at any point in the process.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Probably collaborate in the way I've already described? But a lot of times I delegate the job of generating search terms because it's a repetitive task and it's a timesaver to work from an imperfect list vs. do it perfectly myself.

AI: That's interesting - so you have different approaches depending on the task. With rubrics you collaborate and refine, but with search terms you're more comfortable delegating that initial generation.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I'm in a funny place as a faculty librarian who teaches, but always in a secondary role--I'm not the instructor of record for the classes I see. I might see them once, or I might be embedded for the whole semester. So if I'm working with an instructor of record who has a strict no-AI policy I have to adjust my instruction to that.

AI: That's a really unique position - having to navigate different instructors' policies while still being able to use AI for your own work behind the scenes.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'd rather teach students how to use it correctly instead of pretending we can control whether they do it or not. Faculty are super divided on it and I actually work at a school that just introduced a new AI degree program so it's probably more progressive in that regard than elsewhere.

AI: That tension between different approaches to AI sounds really challenging to navigate. It sounds like you'd prefer a more pragmatic approach - teaching proper use rather than prohibition.

Can you think of a specific moment when using AI yourself felt either really satisfying or particularly frustrating?

User: Sorry I'll answer the part about satisfaction. I think the most satisfying thing is when students are attempting a search library databases on their own but aren't using good search terms, and I'm not super familiar with the topic, so I can use AI to generate and print out a quick list of terms for them. It's satisfying because it's a good teaching moment about using AI to enhance their research, not replace it

AI: That's a great example - using AI as a teaching tool in the moment while showing students how it can enhance rather than replace their own research skills.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not sure I think about losing skills so much as I am people not understanding AI's current limitations and cutting jobs prematurely. I don't believe excellent education or library reference and research can be provided completely by AI. But if it's cheaper, and easier than in-person experts, schools might do it anyway.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you're less concerned about personal skill atrophy and more about institutional decisions that might undervalue the expertise you bring that AI can't replicate.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I suspect I'll remain a bit ahead of my peers in terms of use and ability. It's not like we can go back. But I think right now our expectations are so sky-high it's inevitably we'll have to readjust it at some point.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that parallel standard with students - doing your own feedback without AI because you expect them to write without it wholesale. That ethical consistency really stood out.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating different institutional policies, using AI as a teaching tool, and thinking critically about its limitations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
