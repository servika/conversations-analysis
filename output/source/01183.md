Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds fine to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: Well, I work in a couple of areas. One is graphic design where I need to create personalised prints and designs, the other is written. The written work is normally a presentation that needs to fit a particular theme or piece of writing. usually religious in nature. It may sometimes be an application for a grant or fund. Research is very important in order to ensure that the written work has integrity. The writing needs to be informative, engaging and connect with people in a way that hopefully leaves them feeling changed in some way.

AI: That's really interesting - you're working across both visual and written mediums with some pretty meaningful objectives around connecting with people and creating impact. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I still feel that AI is lacking a bit for the visual process, it appears to struggle when it comes to using fonts and writing. It's really helpful for the writing process. I can use it to give me inspiration. For example providing an idea, theme or piece of writing to the model, it often then provides some insights or thoughts. It's particularly helpful to bounce ideas off, check if certain thoughts or insights are factually accurate, or to help build on ideas. Sometimes, if I have a bit of a block and I don't know where to go next, I can upload what I have and ask for some ideas for what is is missing from the written piece.

AI: Tell me more about that process of bouncing ideas off AI - what does that typically look like when you're in the middle of working on a piece?

User: It may be asking about historical context for a piece of writing (particularly religious writing). Often this may lead to asking further questions about specific people, cultures, religions or practices. This all feeds into gaining a deeper understanding of the piece of writing that is being studied. An example of this may be starting with "give me the historical context of 'passage x'". The response from the model may lead me on to the follow up question "Tell me more about y". Alternatively I may ask the model to rephrase a certain part of my writing to make it clearer, or ask if what I have included in my writing is factually accurate.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic back-and-forth process, especially with the research element. Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: A recent project began with my question "why did Paul feel the need to write these words to the church in Thessaloniki 'make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, 12 so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.'"  This question began the process for me to understand more of what the passage was trying to say, rather than what may at first appear obvious to a modern day western reader. It helped me to get inside the mind of the author of the text. The information provided helped me to begin to find areas of interest and relevance that I could then hang a presentation on, ensuring that I was not misrepresenting the intended message. It was incredibly helpful. Not only did it help give me a starting point, but it also meant that I had a good amount of evidence and information to support my angle.

AI: That's a fascinating example - it sounds like AI helped you move beyond surface-level interpretation to really understand the deeper context and intent. When you're working with AI in that way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am driving the creative decisions. The AI is a great asset to achieving what I want to achieve.

AI: What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: My research has sped up massively. Rather than scrawling through web searches and looking through books, I can ask more direct questions for the specific answers I want. This helps to engage my creativity quicker as well, as I have more time for the creative process and a partner to bounce ideas off.

AI: That's a significant efficiency gain. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: The concerns would be that it becomes so good that there is a temptation to bypass the human element altogether. Whether that is through busyness in other areas, laziness, or that it appears to do a better job without the human input.

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about maintaining that human element. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it may develop into a place where it could become a recorder of thoughts and notes (a bit like a dictaphone), from there it provides suggestions for how to order the thoughts and make sense of them. I think it will also get better at writing specifically in the tone and voice of a particular user (i.e. me). It may be able to produce helpful slides to accompany a talk or presentation, and hopefully improve with fonts and text.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has transformed your research process - moving from "scrawling through web searches" to having that direct, conversational partner for exploring deeper contexts, especially in your religious writing work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing springs to mind

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research partner and collaborator - particularly how it helps you get to the deeper meaning behind texts rather than just surface interpretations - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you're seeing and your concerns about maintaining that essential human element in the creative process. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
