Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good. I have no questions before we start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: One way in which I use AI is to help me draft an improved message to a student or co-worker by asking the model to deliver the message in a more professional tone.

AI: That's interesting - using AI to refine your communication tone. 

Tell me more about that. What kind of messages do you typically ask AI to help you make more professional, and what does that process look like for you?

User: Sure. For instance, if a student sends me an e-mail upset about why they do not have their acceptance letter yet, I have to explain that the student has not met requirements needed before the acceptance letter can be delivered. This subject has to be handled professionally to not upset the student further. I will draft the message I am thinking of delivering and then I paste it to the AI model and ask it to refine the message.

AI: That sounds like a delicate situation to navigate. When you're working with the AI to refine these messages, what happens after you get the refined version back? Do you use it as-is, or do you typically make additional changes before sending it to the student?

User: Sometimes I use it as-is, but if my question was phrased too simple, I will ask AI to re-write the passage with an additional request.

AI: I see - so you sometimes go back and forth with the AI to get it just right. 

Can you walk me through what those additional requests usually look like? What kinds of things do you find yourself asking for in that second round?

User: Sure. I may have forgotten to include the deadline, for example. This would help the upset student understand a timeline for getting their missing requirements completed. AI will then incorporate the deadline into body of the message and suggest a checklist for the student.a

AI: That's helpful - it sounds like AI is doing more than just adjusting tone, but actually helping structure the information in a useful way with checklists.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, there are certain tasks I prefer to handle myself. One of these tasks is finding locations near a student's home that they can go get their fingerprints scanned. Usually, I prefer handling it myself as the AI model may not have complete up-to-date information. For example, a livescan provider may have closed their business in the last month and I would be worried that AI would suggest that location as part of their research.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you need current, reliable information for something that directly affects the student's ability to complete their requirements.

When you do handle those location searches yourself, what's your process? How do you go about finding and verifying those fingerprint locations for students?

User: It depends on the information I am trying to find for the student. It can be as simple as utilizing a search engine and diving into some simple research. Or, I could use credible sources to see an updated list. For instance, I may visit the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's website to see the up-to-date list of approved live scan providers in the United States.

AI: That's a great example of knowing when to rely on authoritative sources versus AI. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would say I mostly collaborate with AI, but sometimes I will delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently. For example, a student may reach out to me stating their schedule for the nursing program is confusing because the days a course takes place on campus is not fixed for the whole quarter. So, I will spend time listing all the days by week that each course takes place on campus. Once I have a long list, I will collaborate with AI on making it into a weekly planner that is easy to understand for the student. But sometimes, I will be assigned a task that I think AI can handle faster than me, such as ideas for a flyer.

AI: Those are really different approaches depending on the task. With that weekly planner example where you collaborated - what did that back-and-forth process look like? How did you and the AI work together to transform your list into something the student could easily use?

User: Once I created the schedule, the AI model created a weekly planner dated between weeks 1-11. I then provided Ai with dates of when classes actually begin and end to make the planner more specific and up-to-date.

AI: That's a nice example of combining your knowledge with AI's formatting capabilities. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others around you use it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: I have seen different approaches. I have colleagues who probably don't use AI at all and other colleagues who also add AI into their daily work tasks. For those that I have seen use AI, we use similar approaches for sure.

AI: Interesting that there's such a range - from no use to regular integration. 

For the colleagues who do use AI similarly to you, have you ever discussed your approaches with them, or learned new ways to use it from watching how they work with it?

User: Yes, I have learned from them 100%. For instance, I did not know I can use AI to summarize a transcript for me. This has been helpful when I have to miss a meeting and instead of watching the 1 hour meeting, I will ask AI to review the transcript to provide me key details. This has helped me save time, put more focus on other tasks, and remain up to date with team announcements.

AI: That's a great time-saver! It sounds like you've really benefited from seeing how others use AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I felt particularly satisfied with AI was when I first started in my role, I was not comfortable with delivering details of why a document a student submitted was not acceptable. These document rejections can upset students, as it may have been rejected because it is an outdated shot/testing and they have renew it/spend more money. When this instance first occurred, I asked AI to review the rejection and help me draft a paragraph for each rejection detailing why it doesn't meet the guidelines. I asked AI to deliver the message in a tone that is both direct yet shows that I am available as a resource to find solutions. In an instant, AI crafted the response I had spent a long time going back and forth in my e-mail drafts trying to type.

AI: That sounds like AI really helped you navigate a difficult communication challenge when you were new to the role. It's clear you found a lot of value in having that support for sensitive conversations.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would say for my role it is not something I actively consider. My role involves a lot of phone calls and on-campus meetings with students and really being someone to lean on as they navigate their decision to start college. I think AI has its place in helping my administrative tasks and responsibilities for sure, but it wouldn't necessary be capable of filling in the importance of the role as a whole. I do think its important to maintain your skills where AI could take over, but really appreciate the assistance for AI. I think of it the same way as I feel about self-driving cars. The idea of a system that can take me from A to B is amazing, but I still think the abillity to operate the vehicle in absence of that feature is a necessity.

AI: That's a really thoughtful analogy with self-driving cars - maintaining the core skills while appreciating the assistance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think the way you use it will change over time?

User: Oh, I absolutely see my relationship with AI evolving. The more I learn about the capabilities of AI, the more eager I am to apply it to my daily work tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI for sensitive student communications while maintaining those essential human connections through phone calls and meetings.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, looks like we have covered everything. thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with human connection, especially in student services, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
