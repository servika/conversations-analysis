Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for caption ideas and generation for social media posts, writing product descriptions for items I am selling and I use it for finding the latest social media trends and what platform they are trending on. Sometimes I will also use it for business help, such as pricing strategies and marketing ideas.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of creative and strategic tasks. When you're working on something like caption ideas or product descriptions, how do you typically approach that? Do you come to AI with a rough idea and build on it together, or do you give it the full brief and let it handle the writing from start to finish?

User: With the caption generation, I come with a post in mind for the content that I have and use AI to build on the captions together. With the product description, I state what the item is and let it write the whole description and just get it to make minor tweaks at the end.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - collaborating on captions but delegating the full product descriptions. What makes you approach those two writing tasks so differently?

User: With the captions, I want them to be as exciting/humorous/eye catching as possible so sometimes the AI will provide me with a caption that gives me a new idea for that content so we build on it together to streamline it as much as possible so I use the AI more for creativity whereas with the product descriptions, there isn't as much creativity required as I just need a description of a product that is grammatically sound and sounds professional.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a creative partner when you want that spark of inspiration, versus as a professional writing assistant for more straightforward tasks.

Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I could use AI for social media content in terms of images and videos that I could create using AI, however, I prefer to do this myself as I enjoy taking photos and staging content so I wouldn't want to stop doing it. I could also use AI for the business side of my work more but I like to know that I have done it accurately and correctly and I'm not ready to trust an AI to help me with it just yet. That isn't to mean I don't ever see myself using it for that stuff as there is a high chance I could.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like enjoyment and trust are key factors in what you keep for yourself. You mentioned you're not quite ready to trust AI with more of the business side yet, but you might be open to it in the future.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing AI use with others in your field?

User: Being in the social media management and content creation world, AI is a topic that comes up regularly and it is something that it seems a lot of people are getting onboard with using in order to speed up the time it takes to create and post content so within the field, I believe it is being used more. However, I do also know that a lot of people are still wary that AI content can still be quite obvious and they don't want it to impact their viewership if people believe some of the content is AI generated.

AI: That tension between efficiency and authenticity seems really central to your field. You mentioned people worry about AI content being obvious to viewers.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I came back from holiday and I had a lot of work to catch up on and I had some new items I needed to put up for sale and I needed a weeks worth of social media posts to create and have ready so I used AI to generate me a weeks worth of captions and it was very satisfying as it provided which caption would suit each day of the week and varied them completely so they didn't sound like they had been generated at the same time and it saved me about 2 hours of work.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI stepping in when you really needed it most. The fact that it varied the captions so they didn't all sound the same - that attention to authenticity seems particularly important in your line of work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As a fairly creative minded person, I personally don't worry about losing my skills because of AI as I still enjoy it and I work with the AI to create social media captions which keeps my skills involved as well as using AI.

AI: That confidence in your creative skills really comes through - it sounds like you see AI more as a tool that enhances what you do rather than something that might replace you.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see myself using AI more, for different aspects of my job, like using it to assist me with business models and admin tasks which I don't utilise at the moment.

AI: That's a natural progression from where you started. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've found that balance between collaboration and delegation based on what each task needs, and your perspective on maintaining authenticity in the social media space.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the creative versus professional sides of AI use, and especially that balance between efficiency and authenticity in social media, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your approach - it's clear you've developed a thoughtful strategy for integrating AI into your workflow while keeping the parts you truly value doing yourself.

Thanks again, and have a great rest of your day!
