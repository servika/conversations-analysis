## Representative Insights

### How Healthcare Professionals Use AI

1. "Yes, AI tools were used mainly for propensity for mortality evaluation to narrow the target population and for data evaluation."
   *— From conversation 00028.md*

2. "Machine learning was used to generate a singular propensity score, whereas traditional approaches used by the medical team was ranking based on the number of risk factors the patient had. AI was also used to help isolate correlated features."
   *— From conversation 00028.md*

3. "I use AI for quick conversions of course, researching material products, keeping up to date with new advances that the industry is working on to stay up to date, a lot more with the proposal section, rewording or rephrasing my thoughts.."
   *— From conversation 00043.md*

4. "with AI, i focus more on the links and then use AI to get me the sources more than anything I guess, traditionally it would be mainly google, which I still use as well, AI in support, but if there are things along the way that I am reading that I need some clarification on, then I will ask AI"
   *— From conversation 00043.md*

5. "simply because I do not think AI is familiar with how that process works, and it would end up wasting my time, it is not familiar with the steps, maybe if I have some time in the future, I can come up with something that I can upload like a step by step instructions/formulas to use, but I find it a task I can excel more at the moment with excel, power BI, matlab"
   *— From conversation 00043.md*

6. "I was working on a life science project in which I aim to develop a therapeutic approach to treat a rare neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a loss-of-function gene mutation. The project was derived from previous identifications of a cohort of patients which exhibit autism-like symptoms and possess a common gene mutation."
   *— From conversation 00084.md*

7. "We did exosome sequencing using their skin tissue samples and we found they all had mutation on the same gene which regulates splicing. And we used iPSCs derived from the patients as a disease model and we found the neurogenic differentiation is impaired. Then we developed anti-sense oligo to target mutated transcripts aiming to eliminate the disease-causing mutated mRNA."
   *— From conversation 00084.md*

8. "I mainly used AI tools to troubleshoot experimental problems. And I also used AI to help me gather information on past research."
   *— From conversation 00084.md*

9. "I consulted AI to understand how to design an ASO. Traditionally, I need to consult expert in this field but I have limited access to them. But AI can help me and can provide sources that can back up its reasoning."
   *— From conversation 00084.md*

10. "I wish it could help me analyse NGS sequencing dataset like this: I upload the fastq raw data to the model and ask it to do read mapping, data analysis and it will do that. Currently, we need to rely on bioinformatician's help with this type of analysis and it's really time consuming and requires much effort in communication. I wish AI can help me analyse these datasets."

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "Machine learning was used to generate a singular propensity score, whereas traditional approaches used by the medical team was ranking based on the number of risk factors the patient had. AI was also used to help isolate correlated features."
   *— From conversation 00028.md*

2. "I always need to ask follow up questions to refine the data or to format it specifically for output into a Google Sheet. For example, I might ask for the last five locations for the annual meeting for the American Medical Association and all available data regarding each of those meetings concerning attendance, room blocks, and other pertinent information. For a visitor scenario I would ask how many travelers visited a place like Greenville, SC for example and for any available data regarding their demographics and interests."
   *— From conversation 00094.md*

3. "I hope that it becomes more normalised to have AI assist in daily duties as i've outlined previously. Currently, the only friction in my relationship with AI comes from colleagues that do not see the benefits or have irrational concerns."
   *— From conversation 00342.md*

4. "There aren't really any parts that I choose to work on myself by preference, but I am limited in the information I can provide the AI due to privacy concerns. For that reason, there are some aspects that I am required to work on myself without the assistance of an AI assistant."
   *— From conversation 00414.md*

5. "I don't use it very often, mainly for research about local community services that can support people with various challenges."
   *— From conversation 00422.md*

## Future Perspectives

1. "simply because I do not think AI is familiar with how that process works, and it would end up wasting my time, it is not familiar with the steps, maybe if I have some time in the future, I can come up with something that I can upload like a step by step instructions/formulas to use, but I find it a task I can excel more at the moment with excel, power BI, matlab"
   *— From conversation 00043.md*

2. "AI was able to quickly gather details regarding all of the meetings held by the American Medical Association, including details regarding upcoming locations and RFP's for future events. I was very happy with that. I still struggle getting it to format information in a way that I intend, either I'm not presenting the details accurately enough or the formatting options for the models are limited."
   *— From conversation 00094.md*

3. "Afterwards with the more dramatic reactions because in those moments I am completely focused at the situation at hand. But for other moments I describe the situation and what I said and how I can handle it better in the future."
   *— From conversation 00127.md*

4. "not really no, I would welcome being replaced in tasks that AI could do better if it means freeing more time for me to apply myself to tasks that AI cannot assist with. In my work, there is extensive patient facing duties that AI would not be able to take over in any meaningful way, at least not in the near future."
