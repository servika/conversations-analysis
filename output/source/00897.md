Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: that sounds good to me. i am ready.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: i use to AI regularly to help me create and plan. i work with children and scheduling is a huge part of what i do. my specific area of focus is early childhood development and creating effective and mindful approaches that go beyond the day to day necessities is essential. i use AI to stay in line with recent research and very often discover new initiatives through the references it provides.

AI: That sounds like AI is playing a really integral role in your work with children. When you mention using it for creating and planning - could you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you go about working with AI when you're developing those mindful approaches?

User: Daily schedules play a key role in a childs development - particularly in their sense of security and also secure attachments. blending what children need for their emotional development with what they need for basic function in society and in every day life in paramount and ever evolving. So typically i remake a schedule on a weekly basis (or as needed) to suit the natural ebb and flow of the children. i start with the basics like meals, snacks, bathroom breaks. Then around these i use AI to fill in additional activities that vary from high energy to low. I often recruit AI to compose coloring or puzzle printables that follow a specific theme for the week and assist the children in practicing focus and mindfulness. i also use AI to search for themed developmental activities that will fit into the childrens schedule- brainstorming with AI is incredubly useful as this helps me to take an idea that i like and reshape it in a way that suits my specific needs.

AI: That's fascinating how you've integrated AI into such a thoughtful, child-centered approach. You mentioned brainstorming with AI and reshaping ideas to suit your specific needs - can you tell me more about what that collaboration process feels like? How do you typically work back and forth with AI when you're developing these activities?

User: I usually start by giving the model as much detail as possible about what i am searching for. for example: "I am looking for a sensory craft project using clay and finger paints. this week we have been focusing on emotional awareness, sharing, counting, and have also had a fieldtrip tp learn about sea life at the auqaurium where the children were able to meet several types of turtles from around the world. i would like the craft to integrate one or more of these ideas or themes."
When the AI provides me with ideas, i select one or two that i favor most and continue to build on it noting what i like and what i want to change.

AI: That's a really detailed way to set up the collaboration. When you select those one or two ideas you favor most and start building on them - what happens next in that process? How do you typically communicate to the AI what you like and what you want to change?

User: i say it directly and as clearly as possible. for example "i really like the clay turtle shell ideas, but id really like to add an element of sharing to the project. I want to encourage the children to give their shells to someone else once they are completed."
The AI then makes suggestions on incorporating my tweeks.

AI: That direct communication style sounds really effective. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work with children that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: not really. aside from my physical presence, i happily use AI as a daily assistant to help me navigate my daily tasks.

AI: That's really interesting that you're so open to using AI across your work tasks. When you do use AI for your daily work, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task like we've been discussing with the craft activities, or do you sometimes delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: i do not delegate complete tasks to AI

AI: Tell me more about that. What leads you to choose collaboration over delegation? What does that look like in practice for you?

User: i do not trust AI to handle tasks entirely alone without my collaboration or continual input. not only does this exclude me from my own job make it harder to work effectively, but AI lack human nuance necesary for working with very young children and requiring constant pivots and adaptation to their specific needs.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the human nuance and adaptability you mention seems crucial in your field. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others around you using it similarly, or do you find yourself approaching it differently?

User: We all use it about the same way. There are a few i have met that refuse to use it all, but none that i have come across delegating whole tasks to it. But i do feel that is the direction it is headed.

AI: You mentioned feeling like delegation to AI is the direction things are headed. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI has been particularly helpful in managing the needs to individual children- it has allowed me to treat each one of them in my care (usually 6 to 7) as unique individuals with their own needs and learning styles, and abilities. the schedules i make are not for everyone- i make one for each child based on their needs and development. while one child may need a high energy task after snack time, another may need a calm down task - this is just one example where i would use AI to plan and schedule multiple bespoke tasks to not only line up the "basics schedule" of snack, lunch, etc, but also to ensure that they can be performed in reasonable proxitmity to one another.

AI: That sounds incredibly thoughtful - creating individualized schedules for 6 to 7 children simultaneously. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No. The connection and relationship that i develop with the chidlren is my most valuable resource and not one that AI is capable of mimicking. it is my professional opinion that while adults may often confuse interactions with AI as a genuine social outlet, children are much more sensitive to their biological need to real life human interactions. everything about their development starts first with attachments - whether they be secure or insecure - it can define almost everything moving forward.

AI: That perspective on attachment and children's sensitivity to genuine human interaction is really compelling. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it continuing in this collaborative assistant role, or do you anticipate changes?

User: i plan to continue utilizing it in a collaborative role and know that several of my collegues intend the same. My concern are those who may over use it without collaboration - removing the human aspect of collaboration would jeopardize the value of that caregivers relationship with children.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you create individualized schedules for each child while maintaining that crucial human element of attachment and relationship-building.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that balance between AI assistance and essential human connection in early childhood development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
