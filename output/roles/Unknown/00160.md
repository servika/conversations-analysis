Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use for mainly for reviewing documents and writing things. I also use it often to figure out alternative ways to write different sentences.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like writing and communication are central to how you use AI. 

Can you walk me through what document reviewing looks like for you? What specific aspects of documents are you having AI help you with?

User: Yes, sometimes I give it a document, like a Comprehensive Plan or Complete Streets Policy and ask it to review it in regards to a request I am writing a staff report about. I then can insert the findings into my staff report that goes to Commissions or Council.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application - using AI to analyze policy documents for staff reports. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're having AI review something like a Comprehensive Plan, what specifically are you asking it to look for or identify in relation to your staff report?

User: Typically like "X person is seeking to rezone land at X location, tell me how this fits into the Comprehensive Plan"

AI: I see - so you're using AI to help you analyze the alignment between specific development requests and existing policy frameworks. That makes a lot of sense for that type of work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, reports on specific policy decisions or recommendations are tough at the local government level. You want to closely review what you are recommending or sending to someone. If I use AI for those things, I have to very closely review the outputs myself.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the difference between using AI for analysis versus for making actual policy recommendations. It sounds like there's a level of responsibility and local context that makes you want to maintain direct control over certain outputs.

When you do use AI for those more sensitive policy recommendations, what does that close review process look like for you? How do you approach checking the AI's work?

User: I usually only use for things where I have a general sense of what I want to say already and just want the ease of writing it with AI so I'll just ensure it follows what I was planning to discuss anyways. Otherwise I might review the documents or plans I ask AI to look at myself as well.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you use AI more as a writing assistant when you already have the substance mapped out, rather than relying on it to generate the core ideas or recommendations.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Yes that's spot on. I would collaborate, adding prompts or clarifying changes as I go.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it gives you a lot of control over the process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have there been any discussions or policies around AI use in your local government role?

User: There have been no discussions or policies about AI use. Myself and a couple other younger staff members are the most familiar with AI at this time.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're somewhat of an early adopter in your workplace environment. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, I have not found accessible AI that is good at interpreting maps. This means anything that would require reviewing a map does not work well with AI. For instance I can't have it review a future land use map.

AI: That's a really specific limitation that must be particularly frustrating in your line of work, where maps and spatial analysis seem so central to what you do.

When you hit those mapping limitations, how do you work around them? Do you find yourself having to switch back and forth between AI-assisted tasks and manual map review, or have you developed other approaches?

User: I just do it myself and maybe use AI to help me write later (focusing on word choice, sentence structure, etc.).

AI: That makes sense - so you've developed a workflow where you handle the spatial analysis yourself and then bring AI back in for the communication piece.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. As a community development director/City Planner there needs to be personal input when dealing with people and communities. There are so many variables and politics involved in crafting policies, ordinances, and making decisions that AI could never replace.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the human judgment and community relationship aspects of your role seem like they require a level of contextual understanding and interpersonal skill that goes well beyond what AI can provide.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think it will stay focused on the areas where you're already finding it helpful?

User: I could see myself using it more. I've found that feeding AI writing samples has helped quite a bit.

AI: That's interesting - using your own writing samples as a way to train AI to match your style or approach. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the human judgment and community relationship aspects of planning work create natural boundaries for where AI fits in your role.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative writing tool while maintaining direct control over policy decisions, and especially your observations about the limitations with spatial analysis, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how you've integrated AI into your planning work. Have a great rest of your day!
