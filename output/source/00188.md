Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's go

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical workday, I use AI for a few things.

Since I'm a product owner with a technical team, I use it to learn about some of the engineering terms and technology that are being used by the engineers developing the features. I like to be able to hold a decent conversation with the team and ask relevant questions to the development of the feature especially in terms of future-proofing and understanding the complexity.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a bridge to better communicate with your engineering team. 

Can you tell me more about what that looks like in practice? When you're learning about these engineering terms and technologies, how do you typically interact with AI to get that understanding?

User: I currently work the a Cloud Engineering team and specifically one that mainly uses AWS as our main service provider. Since AWS has multiple services and features, this can get quite confusing. I use AI to ask more details about a service, what are the main methods of interacting with it, what would it cost the business and also how it interacts with other services. 

Sometimes I also function as a Software Applications Engineer where I actually try to use our team's APIs, services and libraries in code. As I did not major in programming but I do understand the basics of it, I use AI to help me run test code or our user's code and help me understand parts of the code or how to debug. This then helps me with identifying any user frustrations or issues with user guides.

AI: That's fascinating how you're using AI in both those technical roles. It sounds like AI is helping you navigate complexity in different ways - whether it's understanding AWS services or debugging code.

When you're working through code or trying to understand these technical concepts, do you find yourself going back and forth with AI - like having a conversation to build your understanding - or do you tend to ask it to handle complete tasks for you?

User: I usually go back and forth, because I am wanting to fully learn and understand the code or workflow or process. However, I do sometimes just let it handle complete tasks especially when I am very busy with meetings.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like your approach shifts based on what you need in the moment.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, some administrative tasks like generating user stories or tasks or even create powerpoint decks. It is just faster at the moment than dealing with formatting or sorting out details to tune the AI to how the team works and what stakeholders specifically want to see.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like the overhead of getting AI aligned with your specific team dynamics and stakeholder expectations sometimes outweighs the potential benefits.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped how you approach using it?

User: Some colleagues have been trying to use AI to do competitive analysis and product insights which is great. However, we find that AI sometimes hallucinate quite a bit here and does not tell us that it is hallucinating.

AI: That hallucination issue sounds like it could be particularly problematic when you're relying on that analysis for business decisions.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: On the same topic of hallucinations really. We were trying to craft a prompt for AI to gather a monthly competitive analysis of the latest market trend and technologies for kitchen appliances. A few of us were having a go at crafting different prompts however we pretty much failed to generate a response that either did not have any hallucinations or would inform us if it was hallucinating. It was pretty frustrating because we thought it was a great way to get AI to help with this part of our job without us having to spend much time on it as it does require a significant amount of time searching and collecting data.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you can see the potential value but keep running into that reliability issue with hallucinations. It's like having a promising solution that you can't quite trust.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Very much so. So I think that the easier admin side of my skills will definitely be taken over by AI, which is why I would like to develop more and more of my technical skills. I believe that having both product and technical engineering skills will then be very useful in the future.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - building on the technical side while recognizing that some of the admin work might become more automated.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I want to use it more as I believe that if I don't master this skill now, my current skills will no longer be relevant in 5 years. I envision using AI more to automate more of my work and also using AI to create proof-of-concepts of the features themselves without the need of the development team. Once I have tested the POCs with the users, the development team can then be the ones to implement the feature properly.

AI: That's a really strategic vision - using AI to create proof-of-concepts that you can test with users before involving the development team. That could really streamline the product development process.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you're actively developing technical skills while recognizing which parts of your role AI might handle, and your vision for using AI for proof-of-concepts.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: My work unfortunately takes its IP very seriously and so it takes time to use the latest versions of AI models. I wish that it wasn't so but there you go. Something for you to bear in mind with working with businesses.

AI: That's a really valuable point - the tension between wanting to use the latest AI capabilities and the very real IP and security concerns that businesses have. That lag time between what's available and what you can actually use at work must add another layer of complexity to staying current with AI tools.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating technical communication, the challenges with hallucinations in competitive analysis, and especially that reality of IP restrictions in business environments will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the potential and the practical limitations you're encountering.

User: thanks

AI: You're very welcome! Thanks again for participating - your insights were really valuable. Have a great rest of your day!
