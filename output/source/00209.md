AI: That last point is really striking - that AI became integral to your creative work in ways you never expected, even while maintaining those clear boundaries around the actual creative output.

You've shared some incredibly thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can provide a different kind of support - one that's focused purely on your needs without the emotional reciprocity or judgment that comes with human interaction, while still maintaining your creative authenticity.

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experiences so openly. Your insights about the emotional and practical aspects of working with AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: My pleasure!

AI: Thank you again! This was really valuable. Have a great rest of your day!
