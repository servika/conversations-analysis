Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in real estate. My CRM has an AI powered drip feature that automatically follows up with my contacts. I also use NARRPR which has an AI market insight reports analyzer that converts these market reports into social media posts, emails, and other pieces of content. I frequently give AI models like Gemini spreadsheets of market data I pull so that it can summarize the info for me. I also frequently use ChatGPT to draft emails & texts to clients. I've also used it to draft documents like LOIs. Lately, I've been using Gemini and ChatGPT to brainstorm business ideas and deal structure scenarios.

AI: That's quite a range of AI applications across your real estate work. You mentioned using AI for everything from automated follow-ups to brainstorming deal structures.

When you're working with these different AI tools, are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I depends. I'm an introvert, so I like that my CRM can follow up with leads without me. It means I only have to talk to that person if we have something specific to talk about. I'm also busy, so I like that AI can summarize data for me and I don't have to take the time to read it - which can be very time consuming. I do enjoy analyzing deals & I still do that manually. But I'm finding I like to go over my underwriting with AI to brainstorm potential creative deal structures that I may not have thought of, myself.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found AI helps with the parts of your work that drain your energy as an introvert, while you still enjoy the analytical deal work yourself.

When you do work with AI - like when you're brainstorming deal structures or having it summarize data - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm collaborating with it. Even if it was possible for AI to analyze & pitch a deal for me, I wouldn't trust it to do so. I wouldn't want the AI to legally tie me to a price or terms I didn't actually want because it got something wrong about the deal or miscommunicated something to my client. I'm sure there are tasks that I could use AI to automate, but honestly I can't think of anything in my business that could be automated with AI right now. Even with my CRM, the AI is sending emails & texts that I pre-wrote, it doesn't create the content itself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining control over anything that could have legal or financial implications for your clients. It sounds like trust and accuracy are really important factors in how you decide to work with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in real estate around you using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: Other real estate agents use AI a little bit. However, statistically real estate agents are older folks that aren't very tech savvy or open to change. I know that I use AI & tech in general far more than my average real estate peer does.

AI: It sounds like you're ahead of the curve compared to many of your peers in the industry.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. I love that I usually know some market insight or deal strategy right off the top of my head - because it was given to me by AI at some point. I can feed AI reports from huge consulting and real estate firms and it gives me clean, simple to remember data I can use in conversations. Helps me to appear like a legit expert. My main frustration is how easily AI can get with numbers when underwriting deals or calculating something like "if I skip trace and validate a cold lead list with 1,000 records & send cold emails to all the valid emails & direct mail in an handwritten envelop, statistically, how many deals might I close in 12 months". I understand a question likes that required the AI the research varies things, like reply rates for handwritten envelopes & reply-to-closing ratio, but most of this data is online... If I could do this research, do the math, and determine the correct answer, then it's frustrating that AI struggles to do this and provide a consistent accurate answer. In fact, I've asked this question a few times, to the same AI model, but in different conversations and would almost always get a different answer.

AI: That's a fascinating contrast - AI helping you appear more expert by distilling complex reports, but then struggling with the numerical calculations that seem like they should be straightforward for a computer.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No, I figure if AI can do it, then I should let AI do it... Time has value & I don't like spending my time on things I don't need to. So, the only skills I work on with AI is how to get the most out of AI to save me the most time.

AI: That's a very practical approach - focusing on optimizing your AI skills rather than protecting skills that might become redundant.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I actually have an tech start-up idea to make AI a massive part of the typical real estate agents daily workflow. My thought is, if it's something I could hire an VA to do, then I should be able to get AI to do it. I eventually would like to be able to use AI like my executive assistant. Meaning, I don't want to have to prompt AI step-by-step & for every little task, I would like to be able to give AI a basic instruction, order, or command & it follow through on all the steps it needs to get the task done. For example, I could tell my human assistant "get the paper work together for 123 Main St" & a human would know, based off previous tasks or notes in a CRM, where the property was in the transaction cycle & so which docs to pull, how to properly fill them in, and deliver them to me ready to review.

AI: That vision of AI as an executive assistant that understands context and can handle multi-step processes without constant direction is really compelling. It sounds like you're thinking about moving from the current collaboration model to something much more autonomous.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with the energy-draining aspects of your work as an introvert, while you maintain control over the high-stakes decision making.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. That's it. Thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've strategically integrated AI into different aspects of your real estate work - from lead follow-up to market analysis - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great day!
