Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds great; go ahead!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure. I'm a secondary school librarian. AI is definitely not a necessity at my job - I could get by just fine without it - but I do use ChatGPT for a number of tasks. I find it particularly useful for editing emails or other communications I'm going to send out, for tone and clarity, e.g. sending out requests to parents for library fine payments, drafting permission slips for parents to sign to allow their children access to restricted materials, or when I'm sending an all-staff email and I want to get the tone just right. I usually tweak what ChatGPT sends me, but it's useful for getting that baseline. 
Other things I use it for are brainstorming - for example, thinking up titles for a student poetry anthology, or coming up with image cover concepts.
I also sometimes use it for book recommendations when I don't know much about the genre, e.g. graphic novels or sports fiction. It's useful for getting tailored, age-appropriate  recommendations sometimes.

AI: That's really interesting how you've found these specific niches where AI helps enhance your work. 

Tell me more about the email editing process - when you say you usually tweak what ChatGPT sends you, what kinds of changes do you typically find yourself making?

User: Sure. So usually, it's making the email sound less "AI". ChatGPT is really fond of certain things (em-dashes, the rule of three, bullet points and bolding key words) so I adjust those. Otherwise, I just tweak depending on the audience, e.g. making it slightly more informal, adding in personalisation (e.g. if it's going to someone I know I'll put in an icebreaking sentence or two) - just generally making it sound more "me". It's mainly word choice I find useful; when I'm struggling to find the precise vocabulary for what I want to convey, or how to summarise a convoluted set of instructions.

AI: That's a fascinating insight about recognizing AI's "fingerprints" in the writing style. It sounds like you've developed a good sense of how to blend AI assistance with your own voice.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, so anything creative or visual for sure. I run a creative writing club, and we use visual prompts for that - e.g. pictures of people, or settings, or situations, to spark stories / poems. I like to source my own images from open source websites rather than generating them via AI. Students (particularly the creative ones) have an aversion to AI images and won't use them. Some of them won't even read books with covers that have the "feel" of AI-generated images! I have in the past tried sometimes to use AI to adjust images for use on displays - for example, I wanted "mugshot" style images of famous literary characters to use for a murder-mystery themed display - but the results were disappointing and I ended up just using a photo editing app on my phone to create them instead.
I also don't use AI for anything that includes students' personal information.
I've found AI can give incorrect answers to queries about Dewey Decimal classmarks, so don't bother using it for that either.

AI: That's really telling about the students' reactions to AI-generated images - it sounds like they have a pretty keen eye for spotting them. 

When you mention not using AI for anything with students' personal information, could you walk me through your thinking there? What drives that boundary for you?

User: Sure. I suppose it's a distrust of where the data will end up. Obviously schools are very strict on cybersecurity.

AI: That makes complete sense from a school security perspective.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Oh, totally collaborative - I generally dip in and out of it to tweak stuff, or edit things I've already made a start on, and I always check / refine the output myself. I'd never delegate a complete task to it.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it really fits with how you've described using it so far. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Generally my colleagues are very negative re. AI - at least, the ones I've spoken to about it.  Obviously it's a touchy subject in an education setting because of concerns over academic dishonesty. LLMs are blocked for students on the school network.  As a school librarian I'm kind of out of the loop with how the teaching staff use AI; I'm sure lots of them do use it but I've never heard anyone openly admit it.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - being in an environment where there's wariness about AI, but you've found your own practical ways to use it. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure. So a recent example was sending an email to the English department, asking them to bring their students' work down so we could make a display out of it. This was what I requested: "Hello - please could you polish this for me? Hello English dept. colleagues, We're currently refreshing the library's displays. If you have any materials from your classes that you'd like us to include in our Reading Project display, please bring them down to us." The LLM gave me a nice, polished, slightly warmer version of the email that I didn't need to edit at all.
One time I was very frustrated was when I'd made a spelling mistake on a poster. I didn't have the original file so couldn't edit it directly, so asked ChatGPT to edit the image - adjusting the spelling but not anything else about the image. No matter how many times I asked it, it kept changing other things about the image, e.g. colours, size of elements in the background, etc. In the end I just gave up and made a new image from scratch.

AI: Those are such clear examples of when AI hits the sweet spot versus when it misses the mark completely. The email example sounds like it saved you time and mental energy, while the image editing must have been incredibly frustrating when it kept changing things you specifically asked it not to touch.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think staying on top of research skills and how to use AI as a learning / research tool is critical. And staying in the loop with how students are using it.  I recently taught a workshop to sixth-form students on academic research skills, and critically evaluating sources, and use of AI was a big part of that.  In general, I don't think there's a huge amount of scope for AI to take over in school librarianship; I think the threats to the job come from other areas and have existed long before the advent of AI (funding cuts meaning that libraries are turned into self-service "study centres" and book repositories instead). I think AI has the potential to help speed up lots of the "mundane intellectual labour" we do, e.g. cataloguing, classifying, etc.

AI: That's such a thoughtful perspective - seeing AI as potentially helpful for the routine tasks while recognizing that the real challenges to your profession come from completely different directions.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I suppose if the company who provides our cataloguing software / online platform etc adopt it, that would be a potential change. But honestly I don't see it changing much day-to-day. I've been working as a librarian in various contexts for well over a decade now and change is very incremental. We thought eBooks would be a huge revolution - they were, in a way, for higher education -  but in secondary school they've been a dud. I think in the secondary school context students still want what they've always wanted from a library - a welcoming, quiet space, well-stocked shelves, knowledgeable and friendly staff.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective about the pace of change in your field. It sounds like you've seen plenty of "revolutionary" technologies that turned out to have more modest impacts than predicted.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've carved out specific uses for AI while maintaining clear boundaries, and how your students' reactions actually influence some of your decisions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I've just thought of one area AI has been useful - I work in a job-share with a colleague, and sometimes we have differences of opinion over what stock should stay and what should go. E.g. we have a lot of non-fiction that is outdated. Weeding can be a little fraught sometimes, as I'm of the opinion that less can sometimes be more (over-stuffed shelves are visually noisy, physically uncomfortable to work with, and having outdated information is categorically a bad thing), whereas my job-share partner is loath to throw anything out. Being able to plug in a shelf-s with of titles to an LLM and have it do a quick sanity check on what is worth keeping / chucking and why was really useful for getting some clarity!

AI: That's such a clever use case I wouldn't have thought of! Using AI as almost a neutral third party to help resolve those tricky professional disagreements about collection management. It sounds like it gave you both some objective perspective on what can be quite subjective decisions.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that sweet spot between useful AI assistance and maintaining your professional judgment - along with being so attuned to your students' perspectives - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
