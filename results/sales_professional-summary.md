## Representative Insights

### How Sales Professionals Use AI

1. "I will use an AI service or just a chat model to help me come up with tags for my Etsy listings. Etsy has specific parameters for tagging listings, so I use AI to try to come up with product tags that will promote my listings"
   *— From conversation 00026.md*

2. "They usually sound very formulaic, like you can tell they were written by a robot. They don't have much personality, and I feel like my art has personality. The responses sound sterilized.  I usually will copy & paste the whole response and edit it to sound more personable. I keep the keywords that help with SEO or performance, but I edit out the filler stuff that sounds cookie cutter."
   *— From conversation 00026.md*

3. "I don't use AI to create art. I've spoken with a chatbot before to braintorm concepts, but I have really mixed feelings about letting AI generate art itself."
   *— From conversation 00026.md*

4. "It feels like I'd be letting down my community by using AI in my art process. I think there are probably certain areas where AI can be used meaningfully in art, but right now, it feels like AI art only hurts artists. Viewers are now skeptical that anybody's art could be AI-generated, and I think AI art lends itself to plagiarism and the unfair treatment of artists who don't want anything to do with AI."
   *— From conversation 00026.md*

5. "I feed the AI a concept, and it helps me spitball similar ideas, but I still have to make the art. There's no visual or graphic creation, just discussion."
   *— From conversation 00026.md*

6. "I primarily sell gently used books online, on sites like eBay. I use AI primarily when crafting descriptions of said books. I really dislike this part of my job and am grateful that AI tools help me out here."
   *— From conversation 00162.md*

7. "I like to take my own photos of each book, when possible, but if there was an AI tool to help with that process, that would be great. Taking clear, detailed photos of each book is time consuming. I enjoy it, though. For the most part. It's actually one of the reasons I got into book selling. Photography is just as much a passion of mine as books are."
   *— From conversation 00162.md*

8. "Yes, the photography aspect is what I like most about my job. Besides the books themselves! As for using the AI itself, I generally just go ahead and use whatever it's drafted as it's spot on more times than not. It's a very basic process, but I like that about it. The simpler AI is to use, the more I like it."
   *— From conversation 00162.md*

9. "I used to write out all my descriptions myself and it was just so time-consuming. I finally decided to use AI to help write the descriptions and it's been a real game-changer. My output has increased and as a result I'm seeing more sales, which has been a real blessing."
   *— From conversation 00162.md*

10. "I'd love to incorporate it into my business as long as I'm able and it's helpful. I'd especially like to use an AI tool to help me take better pictures."
   *— From conversation 00162.md*

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "Yes, this is something I have been thinking about a little more in recent times. Whilst my workflows and efficiency have definitely improved with AI, I do worry about the cognitive effect it might be having on me."
   *— From conversation 00242.md*

2. "I worry that as I'm increasingly challenging my brain less and less to problem solve, I might be losing the ability to think critically in the same way I used to be. A similar example is when I was younger I used to read vociferously, but as I grew older and became more exposed to instagram reels/tik toks etc, I know find it quite difficult to concentrate on a good book as my attention span is damaged. I worry this could also be the case with AI, if i was to conduct an in depth research project without the use of AI, I worry that i'd be able to."
   *— From conversation 00242.md*

3. "I have only had conversations about AI with my freelancers in regards to potentially asking them to edit AI-generated transcripts, which they are all in favor of. I did have one client ask about AI transcripts, but they opted to go with human-powered services because HIPAA was a concern. Other than that, no conversations around AI usage."
   *— From conversation 00314.md*

4. "The actual sales outreach to clients I prefer to do myself, I'm sure that AI could help with it but I'm confident in my own abilities and quite enjoy the challenge of working out a person through calls/emails rather than letting AI tell me how to proceed."
   *— From conversation 00329.md*

5. "I have been thinking about utlizing AI for more routine, menial tasks, however I do have concern that new people joining will then not learn properly how to do these tasks on their own, and will therefore not know how to identify if there is an error with the AI or be able to modify and correct where needed"
   *— From conversation 00425.md*

## Future Perspectives

1. "I see other sellers using the same tools I do, it's hard not to notice, as it provides descriptions in a very typical format, but we don't really discuss it. Well, at least I don't. I think using AI is kind of expected, though. It's more beneficial than harmful. I believe that's the general consensus."
   *— From conversation 00162.md*

2. "I'd welcome it if it made my job taking photos easier. I really do enjoy that part of my job, but like I said before, what's most important to me is saving time. If AI helps me do that, I'm 100% on board. I can use the free time AI saves me to pursue other creative aspects outside of work! Overall, I'm super happy with the way AI has been able to help me accomplish so much more at work, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for it."
   *— From conversation 00162.md*

3. "I definitely like to decide what pieces I will be making patterns for without asking AI for ideas.  Ultimately, hand-knitting and crochet are quite hard to get assistance from an AI for as it is very visual, but I like to use it as a guide."
   *— From conversation 00184.md*

4. "No I think that just about covers, but just a final note that it seems strange that even with the release of Chat GPT 5, it seems less reliable than previous models, perhaps this is a sign that the rise of AI will be not be as inevitable as I previously thought."
   *— From conversation 00242.md*

5. "I believe soon I will be able to use AI for even more tasks. Ideally, I would like an AI that just watches and learns how I run my business, and then see how it is able to replicate the choices I would make in regards to prices, sale events, and product sourcing."
   *— From conversation 00284.md*

6. "I think I am just more familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of the models. I use it so much in my private life ( it has become the new google for me), that I just kinda know when it will be hepful and when it wont."
   *— From conversation 00312.md*

7. "I am usually focusing on one area for each day. So one day I will work on several blog posts, and then the next day of AI use I will be working solely on lead generation."
   *— From conversation 00314.md*

8. "I wouldn't mind expanding it, but I'm not sure in what ways. I think I would need guidance to show how it could help my specific business, which is 100% online. I do think it was expected in my industry that AI would completely take over transcription services by now, but we are still getting clients, so thankfully that hasn't been an issue so far. But I do see that it could be in the future."
   *— From conversation 00314.md*
