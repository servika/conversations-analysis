Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope this sounds great, let's begin!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a teacher, so I use AI for research and lesson planning. Traditionally, I have worked as a substitute teacher. For this role, I use AI to ask for advice managing tricky situations. For instance, if I have a student with ODD (oppositional defiant disorder), what is the best way to handle outbursts, especially as a new person in the room? I have also recently begun working as an educational resource teacher. Since I'm new to this role, I ask AI questions about new terminology. I may also ask for advice on how to create an IEP or email a parent to set up a meeting. I have also used AI to ask for suggestions for websites or materials to use with students who struggle academically.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like AI is serving multiple roles for you - from immediate classroom management advice to helping you navigate your new position as an educational resource teacher.

When you're asking AI for advice about managing challenging situations like ODD outbursts, how do you typically frame those questions? Do you find yourself providing a lot of specific context about the particular student or situation?

User: I try to provide enough context about the situation so that the AI can be helpful; however, I never mention personal information about the student, such as names or the school's location. I find that providing enough information yields the best feedback or advice. For example, I may phrase a question like this: "I'm a substitute teacher and was working with a new student today. The teacher notes mentioned that a student has ODD and may try to test my limits and see what he could get away with. Within 10 minutes of class starting, the student used inappropriate language and was speaking loudly to ensure that I would hear and react. Any advice on how I could manage this behaviour to prevent the situation from escalating?"

AI: That's a thoughtful approach to balancing useful context with student privacy. 

Tell me more about how you use that advice once you get it from AI. Do you find yourself following the suggestions directly, or do you tend to adapt them based on your own judgment and experience in the moment?

User: I just use the suggestions to get some unbiased advice that I may not have considered from my past experiences or training; however, I often adapt the suggestions. For instance, I may talk with other teachers who have worked with the student and get their feedback about what has worked for that particular student. So I'd say I use a combination of AI advice, my own experiences, and valid suggestions from other professionals!

AI: That's a really interesting way of integrating different sources of guidance. It sounds like you're using AI as one voice in a larger conversation rather than as the definitive answer.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I'd say I prefer to handle tasks that I am used to performing without AI. For example, for report card comments that rely on a specific format, I am more likely to just do those myself, following the template that I've been provided. I think for these tasks, I like to come up with my own feedback since I know the students best. Asking for an AI model to create all comments about one of my students seems impersonal.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's something about those personal assessments that feels like it needs your direct knowledge of the student.

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have back-and-forth conversations with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask for something specific and then take that output to work with on your own?

User: I think my style of interaction depends on the type of conversation that I am having. When I'm seeking advice or reflecting on my teaching pedagogy, I'm more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation. However, if I'm hoping to draft an email to a parent, I will provide the necessary context upfront and then take that output to finish with specifics on my own. If, for instance, I'm looking for suggestions for lesson materials, I will ask follow-up questions if I need to. If the model doesn't provide me with the types of resources that I was initially looking for, I will clarify to hopefully get a better response on the next conversation turn.

AI: That distinction between reflective conversations versus more transactional requests is really clear. It sounds like the nature of what you're trying to accomplish shapes how you engage.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or policies around AI use in education?

User: There are policies in place when it comes to student use of AI. At the beginning of each class, students are often asked to sign contracts attesting that they will not plagiarize information or misattribute AI compositions for their own work. If students are caught cheating, they will have to redo the assignment, or they will receive no credit for this work. There is definitely a balance in using AI as an educational tool and students using it to cheat.

AI: That's interesting how the focus seems to be primarily on student use. 

What about among your fellow teachers - have you had conversations with colleagues about how they're using AI in their own work? Do you get the sense that other educators are incorporating it into lesson planning or classroom management like you are?

User: Sorry, you meant specifically for teachers! I know that my school board has run seminars on how to use AI as an educational tool for lesson planning and resources. I have heard some of the younger teachers mention that they use it; however, there is some resistance among older teachers. Whether this is because they aren't aware of how to implement the technology or they don't like the idea of it, I'm not too sure. As far as I know, there are no specific restrictions on teachers using AI in their work practice.

AI: That generational divide you're noticing is really interesting. It sounds like there's quite a range of adoption among your colleagues.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'd say that AI can make me feel satisfied when it provides a very specific answer that would have taken me a long time to find on my own. Sometimes when researching a specific topic or question, the AI model can pull the answer for me in seconds, while a Google search would require going through many sites. I'd say I feel frustrated when the AI model provides me with information that is false but presents it as true. Sometimes the model confidently presents an answer to a question, but there is no factual basis for it.

AI: That contrast is really stark - the efficiency when it works well versus the confidence it shows even when it's wrong. 

When you encounter those situations where AI presents false information confidently, how do you handle that? Do you find yourself double-checking AI responses more in certain types of tasks than others?

User: I'd say when AI presents false information confidently, but I feel that it may be incorrect, I have to do my own online search. Once I find what I was looking for, I will often correct the model and continue with the conversation. I'd say I only double-check AI responses when I have a suspicion that the information is hard to find or the response doesn't sound entirely plausible or genuine.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using your own judgment to decide when to verify. It sounds like you've developed a sense for when something might need fact-checking.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you use these tools in your teaching work?

User: I think that many teachers are overworked and underfunded, so anything that can streamline the experience and help students is beneficial. I definitely think that AI could primarily take over curriculum development, but teachers will still be needed in the classroom to work with students and deliver the curriculum. In order to maintain teaching skills, using a balance of self-driven materials and AI derived resources will be the most beneficial practice.

AI: That balance you mention sounds really thoughtful - using AI as a support while keeping the human connection at the center of teaching.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you become more experienced in your new role as an educational resource teacher?

User: I'd say as I become more experienced, I won't need to use AI as much to ask basic questions about the role! I will feel more confident in my day-to-day interactions with students, staff, and parents that completing my own work without this additional support will become easier. In the future, I think I will still use AI to research new concepts and potentially troubleshoot materials for new students with exceptionalities.

AI: That progression makes a lot of sense - moving from needing support with fundamentals to using AI more selectively for specialized challenges.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance AI advice with input from colleagues and your own judgment, and how you're thinking about maintaining that human connection in teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No other questions, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as one voice among many in your decision-making, and how you're navigating the balance between efficiency and maintaining those personal connections with students, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your experiences with me today. Have a great rest of your day!
