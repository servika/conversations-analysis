Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a maths lecturer in a sixth form college in the United Kingdom (16-18 years). I deliver on A-Level maths and further maths. The majority of tasks I use AI for is creating resources such as additional starter questions, worksheet, exam style questions and homeworks. Even though the current specification I teach on started in 2017, I find that there's still a limited pool of questions for particular topics. A lot of questions in textbooks are good at getting students used to basics but often students can be stumped by some of the questions in the exam because they seem quite different. I will often screenshot questions students are struggling with and ask AI to create more of these style of questions. This way, the students get lots of practice on these particular types of questions and then we can still use some of the actual exam questions in reserve. Also generally creating worksheets in activities (I used it to create an escape room style activity using Microsoft OneNote recently!) allows me to save lots of time as creating math questions can be time consuming especially at A-Level because of the more advanced algebra. I also use AI if I just want to quickly check the answer to a question or quickly fact check something. There will be more things I use it for but the main one is mostly question creation and sometimes for checking problems/facts.

AI: That's really helpful context - it sounds like you've found AI particularly valuable for expanding your question bank beyond what's available in textbooks. 

When you mention that textbook questions are good for basics but students get stumped by exam-style questions that "seem quite different" - can you tell me more about that gap? What makes those exam questions feel so different from what students have practiced?

User: A lot of textbook questions require knowledge and recall. It may be 'differentiate this' or 'solve this'. Students tend to be pretty good at the knowledge and recall side of things (although sometimes it is helpful to get AI to quickly give me some more questions on a particular topic if they do get stuck) but will struggle with the problem solving/application or just the general wording of questions. Creating more questions gives students a chance to experience a wider range of style of question and push them to questions that require a higher level of reasoning.

AI: That distinction between knowledge recall and problem-solving reasoning makes a lot of sense. It sounds like the AI is helping you bridge that gap by generating questions that require more sophisticated thinking.

When you screenshot a question that students are struggling with and ask AI to create similar ones, how do you typically approach that interaction? Do you find yourself giving the AI specific instructions about what to focus on, or do you let it interpret the question type on its own?

User: It will depend, if they are really struggling, I will get AI to create one that is close to the original but if they are getting more confident, I will try and use AI to add extra layers of difficultly. So I will often give certain constraints on what type of question I want it to create. I also should have mentioned before, I will often get the AI to give me the LaTeX code, that way I can edit this if there are parts I want to slightly change. I also get the AI to provide worked solutions and even additional examples. Yet again, it is about giving students access to a wide range of resources.

AI: That's a smart approach - using LaTeX code so you can make tweaks as needed. It sounds like you have quite a bit of control over the final output.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you're happy to delegate?

User: I still need to solve problems myself and I will still provide my own solutions as it will appear more authentic and will appear in a more familiar style to students who are used to me delivering in that way. I don't use AI for admin as much as I would like to, this mostly due to the system we use wouldn't be compatible because the AI wouldn't be able to edit on these systems.

AI: That makes sense - maintaining your authentic voice in solutions so students recognize your familiar teaching style. And the technical limitations with admin systems are a practical barrier.

When you do use AI for creating those questions and resources, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, refining and adjusting as you go, or do you tend to give it clear instructions upfront and let it handle the complete task independently?

User: It depends on what it produces, sometimes it will give exactly what I want on first go. Sometimes it will be good enough but I still may need to tweak some things in the LaTeX code. Other times I may need to follow up with more instructions, I might use some of the examples it's given me and say 'I like this example, can you give me more like this' for example. So I tend to start minimal to see what it will produce and if that isn't to my standard, I will give some follow ups.

AI: That iterative approach sounds very efficient - starting minimal and then refining based on what works. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other teachers at your college using it similarly, or have you found yourself navigating this more independently?

User: Whilst some of my colleagues will use AI, I'm confident I'm the only one that uses in this way but I do share my resources with them. I know one of my colleagues will use it more than others but they mostly use for checking answers.

AI: Interesting - so you've become something of a pioneer in this particular application, but you're sharing the benefits with your colleagues through the resources you create.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think creating the escape room activity recently went really well recently, creating all the questions would have taken a long time for me to do as creating questions that mathematically work in the first place is time consuming and then I would also have to type them out as well. The AI also gave a contextual story which isn't really my strength so not only did it save time but created a higher quality resource as a result.

AI: That escape room example is fascinating - it sounds like the AI didn't just save you time but actually enhanced the final product with elements you might not have created yourself, like that contextual story.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: In the last few years I've considered my role as an educator to be one of a facilitator rather than a lecturer. What I mean by this, is there is less I need to deliver as students will be using AI more and more to learn and do work but it is still my job a the educator to guide them to use AI reasonably and check they are still learning and understanding the content. There still is that need from students to have that human interaction from a human expert.

AI: That shift from lecturer to facilitator is a really thoughtful way to evolve with the technology. It sounds like you see your expertise becoming more about guiding students in how to learn and use these tools effectively, rather than just delivering content.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding into other areas, or refining how you use it for the tasks you're already doing?

User: I think using it for more admin tasks will be the way. Marking is an area in particular I want to explore more. It's getting close but it's not quite there yet in a way where it is easy to automate the entire process well.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on evolving from lecturer to facilitator and how you're using AI to create higher-quality resources that you then share with colleagues.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI to bridge the gap between basic textbook questions and complex exam-style problems, and especially how you've evolved your teaching role to become more of a facilitator, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've found such creative applications - from escape rooms to expanding question banks - while still maintaining your authentic teaching voice. Thanks again!
