Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Lets begin

AI: Perfect. Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a senior software engineer, AI is a large part of my work. I use AI when trying to understand large API specifications. I also use Copilot in my IDE to assist with coding. That can range from implementing models that fit an API spec, assisting with unit tests, finding bugs or fixing bugs in code.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses. You mentioned understanding large API specifications - that sounds like it could be quite complex work. 

Can you walk me through what that process looks like when you're using AI for that task?

User: I normally begin with opening the API documentation on their website. Take cybersource for instance, I will navigate to their developer docs and get AI to summarise the usages, and general flows. If there is an OpenAPI spec then I might also plug that into an AI and get them to summarise the intended usages, or convert it to code.

AI: That's a really practical approach. It sounds like you're using AI as a kind of analysis tool to break down complex information into something more digestible.

When you're doing this kind of work - analyzing API specs and understanding flows - are there parts of that process you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Yes. When making decisions around PCI DSS compliance I will always do that analysis myself. It is not something we can afford to get wrong.

AI: That makes complete sense - compliance is critical. It sounds like you draw a clear line there between what you delegate and what you keep for yourself.

When you are using AI for those other tasks - like implementing models or working with unit tests - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it back and forth throughout a task, or do you tend to give it complete tasks to handle independently?

User: I normally give it a complete task. For instance, I might give it an open api spec and say "Implement a redis client that integrates with x, y, z endpoints using bearer authentication.' I will then let the AI do it's best attempt and normally have to give it small follow up prompts to get it right.

AI: So you're delegating the full scope but then refining through follow-ups. That's an interesting workflow.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has particular approaches or attitudes toward AI tools?

User: Our company is very open and encouraging the use of AI. My immediate office are all using it, however I do worry about how it might negatively affect our jobs in the future. For instance, I want AI to help me deliver the same amount of work in a shorter amount of time so that I can spend more time with my family, but I don't see it going that way.

AI: That's a really honest perspective. You're experiencing the tension between the immediate benefits and longer-term concerns about how this might change work itself.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When modifying some code I broke a bunch of unit tests. Through manual testing I knew that the code changes were necessary. I asked Copilot (Claude) to fix all of the unit tests and it made suitable modifications and got it right first try. That saved me a lot of time and brain power.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of win you were hoping for - AI handling the tedious but necessary work so you could focus on the more important decisions.

You mentioned earlier worrying about the future impact on jobs. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have already found myself getting lazier when it comes to learning new technologies. In fact, I went to a tech talk the other day and someone gave an example that their team are now delivering code in Python and Javascript when they used to be entirely writing in C#. I worry that they are delivering potentially problem riddled code because they don't understand what the AI is delivering. People need to continuously be learning and understanding code, before asking AI to make changes otherwise they won't know if the changes are suitable or safe.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the risk of becoming disconnected from understanding the code itself. It sounds like you see a real danger in losing that foundational knowledge.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think this is all heading for you personally?

User: I believe that AI will always be a tool that I can use when delivering features. I work in an extremely legacy codebase that AI can often struggle to make suitable changes in. I would be surprised if it ever gets to a point where I can just let it deliver entire features for me.

AI: That's really valuable insight about the limitations you see, especially with legacy systems. It sounds like you expect AI to remain a productivity tool rather than something that fundamentally changes the nature of your role.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining your own understanding of the code and technologies.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical applications, the benefits you're seeing, and especially your thoughtful concerns about skill development and job security will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the positive impacts and the challenges you're navigating. Have a great rest of your day!
