Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good! I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, I work in banking, so AI fits into my workday in a lot of ways but not in many of the ways that people typically think of. I work with high net worth clients and do creative lending, so I have to run risk rating models that depend on my human inputs and calculations when I am assessing risk or preparing documentation to present packages to a committee. I also use LLMs to help me gather qualitative information to complete large credit write ups. For example, I might use something like Claude to gather data on locations of real estate properties to support a deal. Recently, I gathered population and growth data on Hampstead, North Carolina, to support the financing of a real estate property there.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're using AI in some really specific and strategic ways for your lending work. 

Tell me more about that process of gathering qualitative information for credit write-ups. When you were researching Hampstead, North Carolina, for example, how did you work with Claude to get what you needed?

User: I asked about Hampstead's population growth, how the area was impacted by COVID (This is a huge indicator of the soundness of a deal. An area's resilience during the greatest economic threat of our time speaks to the ability of an area to resist or recover from unavoidable challenges!), and even what occupancy rates looked like at similar real estate projects.

AI: That's really insightful - I hadn't thought about COVID resilience as such a key indicator for real estate deals. It makes complete sense though.

When you're working with Claude on this type of research, how do you typically structure that interaction? Are you going back and forth with follow-up questions, or do you tend to give it a comprehensive request and let it handle the research independently?

User: I ask the questions in segments, because I am structuring my write-ups and making sure they sound natural and human. I guess you could say going back and forth with follow up questions is how I do it. I have to be very careful only to include information that cannot be tied back to our client in my queries.

AI: That makes perfect sense - both the privacy concerns and wanting to maintain that natural, human flow in your writing.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are a lot of things I wish I could get AI to handle that would free up my time to do other things- like dealing with customers who need small tasks to be done like re-pinning a debit card or opening a new money market account. Some of the reason the company hasn't rolled that out or can't is because of course, consumer privacy and having to make sure they follow government regulations surrounding privacy and also because a lot of people just prefer human interaction for certain tasks.

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like there are some tasks you'd actually welcome AI taking on, but regulatory and customer preference barriers prevent that.

What about in the work you do have control over - the credit analysis and write-ups? Are there parts of that process where you deliberately choose to handle things yourself rather than using AI, even when it might be able to help?

User: A lot of that has to do with human instinct or qualitative factors that the models are not great at accounting for yet. This is evidenced by the fact that probably 60% of all my risk ratings have to be overridden. There are just inputs that have not been properly processed. I'm not sure if that can change or improve, and part of me doubts that anyone is trying because it's so industry-specific.

AI: That 60% override rate is really striking - it shows just how much specialized human judgment is still essential in your field.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The risk rating model that I was referring to can be really frustrating. It was not developed internally, only customized, so there are a lot of inputs that don't align perfectly with the way we do business. In contrast, some of our internally developed spreadsheets that use macros to calculate inputs are really efficient. I think for an Ai model to be truly effective in the financial sector, it would be best closely developed by the company that is going to use it. But that's expensive and time consuming.

AI: That distinction between the externally-developed risk model versus your internally-developed tools is really telling. It sounds like the fit and customization make all the difference in effectiveness.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find people are generally open to it, hesitant, or is there variation?

User: I think executive leadership has done a great job of communicating that they are pro AI and that we are already using it, just not in the sense that people think of. It seems to be lower level employees like tellers that seem to be very against using it. Im not sure if that's because they're worried about their jobs or they get customer feedback and hear about customer hesitance.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic - the leadership being pro-AI while frontline staff are more resistant. The customer feedback angle you mention is particularly compelling.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think that because of the human instinct factor of risk analysis we discussed, my job is safe. People like me have to figure out the inputs that AI need to be effective. I don't worry about it, but I can understand why some people in the banking sector do.

AI: That confidence makes sense given what you've shared about the limitations you see in current AI models for your specific work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in the coming years?

User: I would love to find out that my company has invested heavily into developing a model that could deliver the kind of results we need. I think it would optimize our workflow and maybe even mitigate some loss that could be attributed to bad human judgement. I personally have never had a loss, but I deal with low risk clientele. I welcome that, but I am also familiar with how AI is trained and feel safe using it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI effectiveness really depends on industry-specific customization and the critical role of human judgment in risk assessment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's all I have to say for now. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuances of AI in banking - especially the distinction between external versus internal tools, the importance of industry-specific development, and how human judgment still plays such a critical role in risk assessment - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
