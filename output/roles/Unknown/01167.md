Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I currently have a small business where I paint and sell paper banners for events and occasions. Typically, I receive an order from a customer, sketch out a design digitally, and then paint the banner as requested.

AI: That sounds like a really hands-on, personal creative process. I can imagine each banner being quite unique.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I typically use AI tools in the brainstorming process. Additionally, I implement AI tools in planning and organizing social media posts and scheduling.

AI: That's interesting - so AI is helping you both with the creative ideation and the business side of things. 

Tell me more about that brainstorming process. What does using AI for brainstorming actually look like for you when you're working on a new banner design?

User: If I am looking to create designs for a certain holiday or more general event, I will ask the AI tool or service for some key motifs or design elements/ slogans that I can implement in the design. Same goes for whatever may be trending currently that I would like to sketch to draw attention to my social pages.

AI: So you're using AI as a kind of creative partner to surface ideas and elements you might not have thought of on your own. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you as the creative process unfolded?

User: Just this past week I wanted to put out a post running a sale on mini banners for the final episode of The Summer I Turned Pretty. I haven't watched the show, so I asked for some key themes of the show that I could use on a banner. The AI told me that the trending topics are Team Conrad vs. Team Jeremiah and gave me a quote from each character that I then drew up n a banner. I felt okay with this because I was just using the AI as a helping tool, and not to make the design for me.

AI: That's a really helpful example - it sounds like you used AI to quickly get up to speed on something you weren't familiar with, but then translated that knowledge into your own creative work.

When you're working with AI in that brainstorming role, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: Because of my own thoughts about AI and the way it impacts workers in creative spaces, I lead the creative process primarily. I will occasionally ask for a list of ideas from the AI, but I almost always turn the conversation towards business planning or research.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - it sounds like you have some clear boundaries about how you engage with AI in your creative work.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Because of the way I have used AI in my social media calendar planning, I know tailor my designs to share best and gain engagement on social platforms. For example, I plan designs further in advance and am typically operating on a 8/12 week out schedule. Because of a brainstorming conversation I had with AI a few weeks ago, I am currently putting out christmas designs.

AI: That's fascinating - so AI has essentially helped you shift from reactive to proactive in your business planning. Being 8-12 weeks ahead and already working on Christmas designs in what I assume is still summer shows a real strategic shift.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Yes! I do not currently have concerns. I think AI is a helpful tool in creative fields when used properly. Since my field is one that is highly personal, AI is not a threat.

AI: That's an interesting distinction you're making - that the personal nature of your work provides some protection. You mentioned earlier having "thoughts about AI and the way it impacts workers in creative spaces."

Tell me more about what you mean by AI being helpful "when used properly" - what does proper use look like to you versus improper use?

User: I think that it is improper for people to use AI to create images and pass them off as their own. It is okay to use AI for inspiration, but not to do your work for you.

AI: That's a clear line you've drawn - using AI for inspiration and support versus letting it do the actual creative work. It sounds like maintaining your role as the artist and creator is really important to you.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: It is really important to me. Unfortunately, I do not think that other feel the same way and I think lines will continue to be blurred.

AI: That's a thoughtful and honest perspective - that while you've found a way to use AI that feels right to you, you're concerned about how others in the creative space might be approaching it differently.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've defined your boundaries around using AI for inspiration and business planning while keeping yourself as the primary creative force behind your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I do not have anything else to share at this time! Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency while strategically using AI for business planning and inspiration have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciated hearing how you've developed such clear principles around AI use in your work, and your perspective on the challenges facing the broader creative community. Your approach of staying 8-12 weeks ahead with your designs while keeping the actual creative work firmly in your own hands is a fascinating example of thoughtful AI integration.

Thanks again for participating in this research - your insights will definitely inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.
