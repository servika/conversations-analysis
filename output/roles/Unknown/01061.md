Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, that sounds good to me :-)

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Most of my work is face-to-face with customers so I don't use AI regularly, but on occasion a customer will fill in a contact form which requires us to email a response. I will use AI to help me format this, as often what I type will not sound professional enough.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI helps you bridge that gap between your natural communication style and what feels appropriate for written customer responses. 

Can you tell me more about what "not professional enough" looks like? What specifically are you changing when you use AI to help format those emails?

User: In general, my emails are written in the style that I speak, but AI can 'polish' my response by using words or phrases that mean the same thing but sound less colloquial - if I have a lot of time, I could phrase the email better myself but often I need to send the response quickly so I can get on with other things and AI thinks much more quickly than I do!

AI: That makes a lot of sense - so it's really about efficiency and speed when you're juggling multiple tasks. 

When you say AI "thinks much more quickly" than you do for this particular task, what does that process actually look like? Do you write out your full response first and then ask AI to polish it, or do you work with it differently?

User: No, I do exactly that - write a quick response as it comes to me, and then ask AI to re-word it to sound more professional.

AI: Got it - so you draft it in your natural voice first, then hand it over for that professional polish.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: We will often provide an invoice for the customer once they've had work done, which perhaps could be done by AI. The invoice will contain information on the name of the service and what that entailed, so AI could do this part - but I worry that it might get some details wrong, meaning I have to check it anyway and so it wouldn't save me any time in the long run.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - the trust factor and the need to verify accuracy. It sounds like with email formatting, you can easily spot if something's off, but with invoices, the stakes feel different.

Tell me more about that worry of getting details wrong. What kinds of details are you most concerned AI might miss or misinterpret when it comes to invoicing?

User: On the occasions where the customer requires the invoice to be 100% accurate because they are claiming money back from a warranty company, I would worry that AI might miss something or make a mistake, meaning that the customers claim is delayed - this would probably cause the customer to complain to us, and we want to avoid this kind of situation as it could lead to us losing customers. For example, if a customer had a suspension component replaced, AI may not include the full details about the part or any supplementary work that was also needed, meaning that the customer does not get the full cost refunded.

AI: That really highlights the high stakes involved - where a small error could cascade into customer complaints and potentially lost business. It sounds like those invoice details require very specific domain knowledge about parts and supplementary work that you'd be concerned AI might not capture accurately.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Yes, although I do love how AI can give me an almost instant response, I always want to check it for accuracy meaning it does not save me the amount of time I need it to - so yes, when I use it, it's in collaboration with me also carrying out elements to make sure that everything is 100% accurate.

AI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense given your concerns about accuracy. It sounds like you've found this sweet spot with email polishing where the collaboration works well, but for other tasks the verification step might actually slow things down rather than speed them up.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: AI is not widely used in our workplace as the majority of the work carried out is manual, and to integrate AI would mean large financial investment which the business cannot/doesn't want to pay out currently. As I carry out admin tasks there is more scope for me to use AI, but my other admin colleagues are more reluctant as they've had less exposure and so are more unsure of the capabilities.

AI: That paints a really clear picture - you're almost a pioneer in AI use within your workplace because of both the nature of your role and your comfort level with the technology.

When you say your admin colleagues are "more unsure of the capabilities," what do you think they're most uncertain about? Is it more about not knowing what AI can do, or concerns about what might go wrong?

User: I think it's a combination of the two elements - their exposure so far has been limited to people telling them about how AI helped them re-design their garden, or helped their child with a school project, so they find it hard to see how it can translate to help us with what we do. Then there is the worry that AI cannot know everything that we know and so they will have to get involved anyway.

AI: That's fascinating - so there's this gap between the consumer uses they've heard about and seeing the professional applications, plus that same concern you mentioned about still needing to verify everything anyway.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently, I tried using AI to generate an invoice for a customer. The next day, they emailed to say that the type of service they had asked for was different to what they had received, according to the invoice. This was frustrating, because the customer had received what they had asked for, but the AI invoice had just used the standard information, whereas if I had generated it myself, I would have tailored it to the customers expectations, avoiding any complaints.

AI: That's a perfect example of what you were describing earlier - where AI missed those nuanced details that you would have naturally included. It sounds like you understand not just the technical aspects of what was done, but also how to frame it in a way that matches the customer's mental model of what they requested.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do worry sometimes that roles like mine could be made obsolete by AI, but I also think that it will be many years before that happens, due to situations like the one above. I have considered growing my skillset to include more technological capabilities, but haven't decided on which route to take yet.

AI: That balance between recognizing the potential threat but also seeing the current limitations is really thoughtful. It sounds like you're in this interesting position where you can see both AI's capabilities and its current gaps pretty clearly.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will continue to use it for the tasks we know it can do well (such as emails to customers) and I will probably use it more frequently for this than I do now. But I also think that some elements such as invoicing will remain a person specific activity to ensure accuracy.

AI: That makes perfect sense - leaning more into what's already working well while maintaining human oversight where accuracy is critical.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how trust and verification needs vary so much depending on the task and the stakes involved.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think I've shared everything relevant.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced differences between tasks - where AI works well versus where human expertise is still essential - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective, especially as someone navigating AI adoption in a workplace where you're somewhat of a pioneer. Thanks again!
