Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good. Lets begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a substitute instructional aid for a school district. The only time I am currently using AI is to ask quick questions if needed.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI more as a quick reference tool. Can you tell me more about what kinds of questions you find yourself asking when you're working as a substitute instructional aid?

User: Sometimes I may ask for ways to help or handle a child when there is conflict. The most appropriate way, since you cannot handle it the same way you many handle things at home with your own children.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - needing guidance on professional approaches that are appropriate for the school environment. When you're in those conflict situations with students, what leads you to turn to AI rather than asking a colleague or supervisor for advice?

User: Sometimes I do not agree with how other people handle situations with the children. Sometimes they talk to harshly, or brush things off when they should be taken more seriously.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - it sounds like you're using AI as a way to get guidance that aligns with your own values about how children should be treated. When you get advice from AI in those moments, how do you typically use that information? Do you apply it right away in the situation, or does it help you think through your approach?

User: I would say both. Sometimes it is just useful to have information that i have already looked up ready for me when I need it. Sometimes I may use it for particular students who need more attention or get into more trouble.

AI: That's helpful - so you're using AI both in the moment when situations arise, and also proactively to prepare for working with specific students who might need different approaches. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I am not really sure what AI could help with other than what I already use it for. Maybe i am just Naive in thinking that. Is there more that I could use it for when it comes to teaching/helping children in a school setting, while not being the actual teacher?

AI: That's actually a great question, and it shows you're thinking carefully about your role. Rather than me suggesting what you could use it for, I'm more interested in understanding your current approach. 

Are there aspects of working with the students - whether it's explaining concepts, managing classroom situations, or interacting with the kids - where you feel like you want to rely on your own judgment or instincts rather than seeking outside input?

User: Yes there are times i would rather rely on my own judgement. Like I mentioned previously, sometimes i do not agree with how others handle situations. I also like to have things be a learning experience for me and I like to work through things myself sometimes.

AI: That's really insightful - you're balancing getting helpful guidance with maintaining your own professional growth and judgment. When you do choose to work through situations yourself rather than asking AI for advice, what helps you make that decision in the moment?

User: Whether or not it would be appropriate in that moment. It would be rude if i am talking with a child and then just turn on my phone and start asking questions. That is why there are times i will ask questions preemptively so I can prepare.

AI: That makes perfect sense - you're being mindful of staying present with the students and not disrupting those important interactions. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it to work through a situation, or do you tend to ask a specific question and use that response?

User: I tend to use that a specific response to a specific question. There may be times i may have to follow up with more questions, but i do not always have to do that

AI: Got it - so you're usually looking for targeted, practical advice rather than extended conversations. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about using these tools, or is it something you've figured out on your own?

User: They have not influenced it at all actually. I have figured it out myself. I started using AI to ask questions and have conversations before i got the job. I have always found it easier than googling the information.

AI: That's interesting that you came to this approach independently. You mentioned finding it easier than googling - what makes the AI interaction work better for you compared to searching online?

User: I do not have to search through different links for the answer. I can speak the question and get a quick response, which is a lot of the time, exactly what I need. I am a busy person. i have children, pets, a home to take care of, and multiple jobs I do. most of the time quick is what i need

AI: That efficiency factor sounds crucial given everything you're juggling. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There have been a couple times when I have used it after a situation because i was curious if i did/said the right things in the moments. Sometimes it is satisfying knowing i took the right approach. And sometimes it is frustrating to see where maybe i was lacking and could have taken a different approach that may have been better for the situation. Some kids need different approaches, and sometimes when you are in the moment, you may not think of somthing

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to use it - almost like a reflection tool to learn from your interactions. When you discover through AI that there might have been a better approach, how does that affect how you handle similar situations going forward?

User: Its a great learning experience. I would then have new tools i could use. and even though i might have not done the best i could have done in that moment, knowing that i have that new knowledge is relieving and encouraging.

AI: That's a wonderful perspective on learning and growth. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you gain more experience in your role?

User: at this moment I am not sure how it would evolve. I think there will always be new questions to ask, so i am sure i would continue to use it; I am just not sure if the ways i use it would change. Only time will tell

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as both a preparation tool and a reflection tool to learn from your interactions with students - that shows a lot of intentionality about your professional growth.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a quick, efficient resource while still maintaining your own professional judgment and growth will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about balancing getting helpful guidance with staying present for the students and continuing to develop your own skills. Take care!
