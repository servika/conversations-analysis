Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm good, let's do it

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI helps me with writing internal and external emails to help sound a bit more professional. It also helps me come up with different ideas to try inside the banking world.

AI: That's interesting - you're using it both for communication and creative ideation in banking. 

When you say it helps you come up with different ideas to try in the banking world, can you tell me more about that? What kind of ideas are you typically looking for?

User: I will typically be given tasks or just have some tasks to complete usually revolving around opening or doing maintenance on personal bank accounts.

AI: I see, so you're working on tasks around personal bank account management. 

When you use AI to help generate ideas for these account opening or maintenance tasks, what does that process look like? Are you asking it to suggest different approaches to handle a specific situation, or something else?

User: I will give it a situation and have it generate some approaches or ideas to complete whatever I need.

AI: That makes sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. 

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Its not really preference, but it is a requirement. I cannot put PII into any AI models for legal and privacy reasons. So any task where it would directly need to know this information, I will not use AI for.

AI: That's a really important distinction - the legal and privacy constraints around PII in banking. 

Beyond those required limitations with sensitive information, when you do use AI for the tasks where it's allowed, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it the situation and let it generate ideas independently?

User: The only form of collaboration is giving it feedback on what ideas I do or dont like and just telling it to generate new ideas from those constraints

AI: So you're using more of an iterative feedback approach - giving it constraints based on what works or doesn't work for you.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or do you see different approaches?

User: I am pretty much the only one to use AI. I have slowly been able to get people to use it more frequently for things but for the most part I am the only one that uses it in my work that I know of.

AI: That's fascinating that you're essentially pioneering AI use in your workplace. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had to write a very stern email to a client of ours and I could not make it sound very professional without sounding very mean and rude. I asked an AI to help me write it, I redacted the PII from the original email I wrote and tried to have it phrase it better. It could not give me anything useful without removing all the important bits of information. I ended up having to get a coworker I know is good at writing to rewrite it for me and she came up with a much better email.

AI: That sounds like a really frustrating experience - especially when you needed to balance being firm but professional, and the AI couldn't help without the context it needed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, particularly given that you're one of the early adopters at your workplace?

User: I feel as if maintaining certain skills that AI can essentially automate is going to be really difficult and I have found I have to have a balance of using AI and not just so I don't lose out on being able to effectively think freely.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about needing that balance to preserve your ability to think freely.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as your workplace becomes more comfortable with it, or in other ways?

User: I think the banking industry will be forced to include more AI features and uses. They will have to self-host AI models to ensure data stays within the bank and doesn't accidentally get leaked via a 3rd party AI hosting service

AI: That's a really insightful prediction about the banking industry's direction - the need for self-hosted models to maintain data security makes a lot of sense given those PII constraints you mentioned earlier.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on needing to balance AI use with maintaining your own thinking skills, and your prediction about how banking will need to adapt with self-hosted solutions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think thats all

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being an early adopter in a highly regulated industry, the challenges with PII limitations, and your thoughts on maintaining cognitive skills while using AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
