Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions at the moment, please continue.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive in.

To start, I'd love to get a sense of your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: Recently I commissioned a 150MW BESS and substation project. In addition to the electrical design in AutoCAD, I created an insulation coordination study for surge arresters and harmonics study for inverters from first principles. The final output of the project was an active substation and BESS.

AI: That sounds like a substantial project with a lot of technical complexity. So you went from the initial design work in AutoCAD through those specialized studies - the insulation coordination and harmonics analysis - all the way to commissioning the actual facility.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI in a few places. Here is a list of things I recall:
1. AutoCAD error fixes. I had an unusual error in AutoCAD MEP where my command line was not working and none of my schematics symbols - which are MEP objects - were showing.

AI: That's really interesting - you used AI for troubleshooting that specific AutoCAD MEP issue. Tell me more about that. How did you decide to turn to AI for that particular problem rather than using your usual approach when you hit technical issues?

User: Excuse me, I pressed enter instead of Alt+Enter. The list continued:
1. I used it to learn more about how different surge arresters could be used and the roles TOV and MCOV play in surge arrester selection.
2. Harmonics study: I asked about triplen harmonics, differences in inverters, and whether current or voltage magnitude harmonics are useful to utilities.

AI: Thanks for the full list! So you used AI for the AutoCAD troubleshooting, learning about surge arrester specifications, and getting clarity on harmonics analysis concepts.

Let's dig into one of these - for the surge arrester selection where you were learning about TOV and MCOV, how did you decide to use AI versus your traditional approach for getting that technical information?

User: The IEEE code I was using was C62.11-1999 - if I remember correctly. This code has some graphs in Annex B that can be used in conjunction with impedance ratios from ETAP. However, before I knew what code to find this in, I asked AI to help me find these curves. It was a quick search tool in IEEE libraries.

AI: That's a really practical use case - using AI as a search tool to help you navigate to the right IEEE standard before diving into the technical details. It sounds like it helped you locate C62.11-1999 and those Annex B curves more efficiently than you might have found them otherwise.

Thinking about the parts of your research and design work where you haven't used AI - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: Specificity - although the upper hand that AI has over classical search tools like Google is the ability to customise responses based on exact user inputs and constraints, it sometimes word vomits and feels overwhelming to use. The second reason was to have a more in-depth understanding of a topic instead of jumping to an answer or output.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making. The word vomit issue is interesting - it sounds like sometimes AI gives you more than you need when you're looking for something specific.

And I'm curious about that second point - wanting deeper understanding rather than jumping to an answer. Can you tell me more about how that plays into your decision-making? Are there specific types of problems where you feel like working through it yourself is more valuable than getting an AI-generated response?

User: The thing with learning is that without struggle or alternative options being considered, it is difficult to retain information. AI usually gives the correct answer without alternative thought processes. This kills creativity and also makes it difficult to defend decisions made about research topics. For example, if I choose a Siemens surge arrester because an AI tool tells me to, I do not consider all possible options - ABB, Hubbell, Richards, etc. Perhaps I can ask an AI tool to compare common available ones for me but then one must consider what information they may be missing if they do not look at the datasheet themeselves.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the learning process. You're highlighting something important - that the struggle of working through alternatives yourself is actually valuable for both retention and being able to defend your technical decisions later.

When you have used AI for something like the harmonics study questions, how do you verify or validate what it produces? Do you have a process for checking that information before you rely on it?

User: I do check information - sometimes information is not available in AI tools such as specific values from datasheets which are only distributed under an NDA so that information cannot be used. However, sometimes if something "seems" right, and is in the ballpark of being correct then I might trust it. For example, if an AI tells me that 50kg is 120lbs, I would not question it too much.

AI: That makes sense - you have this intuitive calibration where if something falls within your expected range, you're more likely to trust it without extensive verification.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research or engineering work that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: Probably formatting in AutoCAD. I feel like I waste a lot of time making things look pretty when it is something I could delegate to an AI.

AI: That's fascinating - so it's the presentation layer where you see the biggest opportunity. It sounds like you're spending valuable engineering time on formatting tasks that could potentially be automated.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on balancing AI efficiency with deep learning, and how you calibrate trust based on your technical intuition, was particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your engineering work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I would say Excel calculators. We have calculators for all sorts of things - battery calculations, load calculations, CT saturation, and load flow. If one could give relevant information and have an excel sheet filled out and updated, that would be useful.

AI: That's a really valuable addition - the idea of AI being able to populate and update those specialized Excel calculators based on project parameters you provide. It sounds like another area where AI could handle the routine data entry and formatting while you focus on the engineering judgment.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI efficiency and maintaining that deep technical understanding - especially your point about needing to consider all the Siemens, ABB, Hubbell alternatives yourself - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real engineering work. 

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

User: Thank yo

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you so much for your time and thoughtful responses. Your perspective as an electrical engineer working on these complex power systems projects has been incredibly valuable for our research. Take care!
