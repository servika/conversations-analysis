Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yes that sounds good, and no questions!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a web content editor and use AI in a number of ways. One of the most basic ways is to ensure that the content I'm putting online adheres to our house style. To do that, I have a specific GPT in ChatGPT, where I've fed in our extensive style guide, as well as examples of where it's been used in practice, and examples of our brand voice. I then run content through this to make sure it's optimised for publishing on the web. 

I also use AI to help me bring down the reading age of material and rework it so that it's web-friendly. I have been doing this manually for years but find that I can save time this way. For example, I have recently been sent content for university level modules (I work at a university)  but it's often written in a way that fellow academics can understand, but that applicants/new students would struggle with. AI can help me quickly simplify this, although it usually needs human edits in addition. 

Another way I'll use AI is to help me draw up reports and insights based on our analytics data that I can share with colleagues. For example, I recently fed in the analytics for our graduation website to see what conclusions it could draw from the data and whether it had any suggestions for how we could optimise the website in future. I do the same with SEO pieces to see if can highlight ways to improve.

I'm finding I'm using it more and more to save time and to get more work done, particularly since there has been a voluntary severance scheme at my place of work, meaning there are now fewer people in our team, yet the same amount of work to get through.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've found some very practical applications across different aspects of your role. I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about the content needing human edits in addition to the AI simplification.

When you're working on those university module materials, what specifically do you find yourself needing to adjust after the AI has simplified the content?

User: The biggest thing for me is to make it sound less 'AI'. I find that AI tends to reuse the same phrases - it will often want to 'dive in' to a topic for instance - and also the rhythm of the writing and the sentence patterns that it uses can sound quite formulaic. I often need to manually intervene here to break sentences up, make it sound a little choppier sometimes, so it sounds human written. Additionally, there are occasionally times when, particularly with very specialist modules, the AI will lose the exact nuance that we're trying to convey.  So often it's a bit of a balancing act with making it readable but not losing that specificity.

AI: That's a fascinating balance you're describing - maintaining readability while preserving academic nuance. It sounds like you've developed a real sensitivity to AI's particular writing patterns.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: If I'm writing content from scratch, e.g. I recently wrote an article on 'Tips for an open day', I prefer to do the bulk of the writing myself and then perhaps use an AI for its advice or to help polish. But I find if I go to it first then it can use a very AI voice which is hard to break out of.

I tend to write all emails myself too as it just seems quicker to type out the email rather than tell the AI what to say.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've found that starting with your own voice gives you better control over the final outcome.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I never let it handle stuff independently as I don't feel it is quite there yet and still needs a lot of oversight. I definitely collaborate with it throughout. I work from home a lot of the time (which I do prefer) but it is nice to have someone  - or something - to offer an extra pair of eyes on what I've written.  I'll also often add in extra instructions to the AI as I go. So with the modules I started off quite simply just getting it to reformat so I could stick it straight up on the web with things like correct capitalisation for bullets, using html for nested bullets etc, but then gradually got it to do more with the actual content itself, bringing down the reading age, etc. However, it did often struggle to remember all the instructions at one time so often needed reminding. I couldn't have just fed in all my original modules and got a perfect result back.

AI: That collaborative approach really comes through - and it's interesting how you've gradually expanded what you ask it to do as you've learned its capabilities and limitations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Our workplace is actually really split on the use of it. I am one of the older people in my workplace and we've found that we're actually keener on its use than our younger colleagues, some of whom are very hostile. However there are a lot of people interested in it now and there are lots of discussions about how we can make it work for us. I also find that AI is coming baked in to some of the software that we use for things like SEO so we're interacting with it all the time regardless.

AI: That's really interesting - the age split you're describing is quite different from what many people might expect. It sounds like there's quite a range of attitudes in your workplace.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I remember being a little frustrated the other day when I was asking it for advice on the Open Day tips article that I mentioned earlier. I sent it my draft, and then it made comments, then I shared the pdf of the webpage when I put it online to ask for feedback on page layout etc. It was capable of reading the pdf, and did so eventually, but it kept giving me comments on the initial draft rather than the pdf I'd just shared. This was quite annoying.

AI: That does sound frustrating - especially when you're trying to get feedback on the specific final version you've created. It's like it wasn't keeping track of where you were in the process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Colleagues do worry that AI might take over writing content for the web. However I don't think that will happen any time soon as it tends to write in a very AI voice and is too vague. It could churn out articles but right now I feel we need a lot of human input too to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. I am trying to make sure I am skilled at working with AI so that we can collaborate in future rather than it taking over.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - positioning yourself as someone who can work effectively with AI rather than seeing it as competition.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think as AI gets better and doesn't need to be corrected and checked so much, I may let it do a little more for me. That would actually free me up to do other things that I don't get as much time for in my job but which would be beneficial, such as user testing.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective - seeing AI as potentially freeing up time for higher-value activities like user testing that you'd like to do more of.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've gradually expanded AI's role while maintaining that collaborative oversight, and how you're thinking strategically about positioning yourself to work with AI rather than against it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: One thing I forgot to say is that I've tried to use it to edit images for me - often the ones we're sent to go on the web don't quite work unless they're tweaked a bit - but so far it's always done a really poor job. I hope in the future this improves, as I am not trained in photo editing so it would be really useful. But that's all, I think.

AI: That's a great addition - and it highlights how AI capabilities vary so much across different types of tasks. It sounds like while it's become quite useful for your text-based work, the visual editing still has a long way to go to meet your needs.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach you've developed, the workplace dynamics around AI adoption, and how you're thinking about skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
