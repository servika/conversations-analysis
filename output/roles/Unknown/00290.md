Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a special needs paraprofessional, I sometimes use AI to help me to better care for our autistic or differently abled students, to understand their needs or behaviors. The children I work with are at an elementary school level, many are severely autistic, and non-verbal.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work. I'd love to understand more about how AI helps you in those situations.

When you're trying to understand a student's needs or behaviors, what does that process look like for you when you involve AI?

User: I might ask it for advice for finding ways to help to calm a child's meltdown, when the regular methods are not working. Sometimes a child will display repetitive, and destructive behaviors and I am seeking ways to replace those behaviors with healthier ones.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're looking for additional strategies when your usual approaches aren't effective. 

Can you walk me through what a specific interaction with AI might look like in one of those moments? For instance, when you're dealing with a child's meltdown or trying to redirect destructive behaviors?

User: Usually, it is after the fact, upon reflecting on the behavior, I will look up strategies for future handling of those events.

AI: Ah, so it's more of a reflective process after the situation has occurred. That's really thoughtful planning on your part.

When you're doing that reflection and research, what kind of information do you typically share with the AI to get helpful strategies? How do you describe what happened?

User: I usually try to describe the things that led up to the behavior, the environment in which it happened, or describe when I might typically see such a behavior. If I am privy to the info, I might provide the known conditions the child has, such as autism, cerebral palsy, or ADHD, which would affect the approach.

If I am privy to the info, I might provide the known conditions the child has, such as autism, cerebral palsy, or ADHD, which would affect the approach.

AI: That's a very comprehensive approach - considering the triggers, environment, and the child's specific conditions. It sounds like you're really painting a full picture to get relevant guidance.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI in this context. Are there aspects of working with these students that you prefer to handle entirely on your own, even though AI might be able to offer input?

User: Some instances are too intricate to fully explain in an efficient, yet thorough way, so I would tend to use my training or ask coworkers for support.

AI: That makes complete sense - there are those nuanced, complex situations that really require the human judgment and experience you bring, or the insight from colleagues who know the specific context.

When you do use AI for work, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it as you work through strategies, or do you tend to present a situation and let it provide a complete response?

User: I tend to do the ladder, present a situation then let it provide a complete response, though I do tend to refine and after the initial complete response.

AI: So you start with that full situation description, get a comprehensive response, and then refine from there. That sounds like an efficient approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others in your school are using it similarly, or is this more of an individual approach you've developed?

User: I am not aware of others in my workplace using this approach.

AI: So you've kind of pioneered this approach on your own. That's interesting - it shows you're being really proactive in finding tools to better support your students.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I found out we would be getting a new student who had a health condition that I had no previous experience working with. I chatted with AI to discover typical needs for children who have this condition, so that I might better prepare myself for their mental and physical needs. I found it fairly beneficial because I was given specific information not only about the condition itself but also things to consider when a child with this condition is in a school setting.

AI: That sounds like it was really valuable preparation - getting both the general understanding of the condition and the specific school-setting considerations. It sounds like you felt well-equipped when that student arrived.

How do you think about maintaining your skills and expertise in areas where AI could potentially provide guidance? Is this something you actively consider as you use these tools?

User: I have not specifically thought about using AI to maintain skills as we go through regular training at my job, however I do see where this could be beneficial.

AI: That's a fair point - you already have that regular training structure in place. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different purposes as you continue in your role?

User: I don't see using it for different purposes in my current role other than what I am currently doing. The administration and teachers themselves are more involved with shaping our procedures and practices, but I do see use for it in roles just above mine. I think it could be beneficial for SPED teachers to help with the plethora of forms and documentation that needs to be worked through regarding these students, like IEP forms and the like.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI as a reflective tool to better prepare for future situations with your students - that shows such dedication to continuous improvement in supporting them.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a preparation and reflection tool in special education will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. 

It's clear you're doing really important work supporting these students, and it's been valuable to understand how you've thoughtfully integrated AI into that process.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
