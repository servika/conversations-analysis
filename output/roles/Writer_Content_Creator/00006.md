Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a copywriter. A typical project would be researching, drafting, and editing a piece of writing and using the necessary tone and format for the piece. I generally write copy for websites and blogs, but I have also written a couple of articles for magazines.

AI: That's really interesting work. I can imagine each piece requires adapting to quite different audiences and styles.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I have reached for them to brainstorm ideas for certain projects or to help create catchy headings if my creative juices aren't flowing. A couple of times, if I've been particularly short on time, I've used them to create first drafts that I've then gone in to edit (usually quite heavily). I use AI more as a collaborator. I don't like to hand over the reins entirely!

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - using AI as a collaborator rather than handing over the reins. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was tasked with writing some financial content for a website recently, which isn't something I'm particularly clued up on. I asked some LLMs to explain the concepts to me in a simplified manner so that I had a clearer idea before I started writing. I found this really helpful and insightful. I did do some online research, too, but the amount of information felt overwhelming, so it was nice to get some clarity.

AI: That sounds like a really practical use case - using AI to help you get your bearings in an unfamiliar subject area before diving into the writing itself.

When you're working with AI in situations like that, or when you're brainstorming or creating first drafts, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'd like to think it's me who is driving the decisions. I provide some sort of input about the kind of content I want in terms of tone, format, length, etc. I can then ask the AI to alter its creative output to my preference. I never just take what the AI gives me at face value; there is always substantial editing and human input. I  always feel in control, and wouldn't want the AI to be doing everything for me.

AI: That sense of maintaining control sounds really important to you. It's interesting how you describe providing the parameters and direction, then shaping what comes back.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: In some ways, I feel that it has helped me to become more efficient. Rather than spending time on things that might matter a bit less, such as headings, my time can be spent on the body of the text.

AI: That's a really practical efficiency gain - being able to focus your creative energy on the more substantive parts of the writing.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Honestly, I worry that it will make copywriting obsolete in the next few years. I have seen the improvements LLMs have made over quite a short period of time, and the output in terms of writing quality has improved substantially. If companies can get AI to produce writing that is up to or even beyond the standard of humans, why would they pay a human?

AI: That's a very real concern, and I can understand how the rapid improvements you've witnessed would make that feel quite pressing.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think there are ways you might adapt or change how you approach your work?

User: I imagine it will become an even more collaborative process, but I will continue to use it as I have, like an assistant rather than letting it do my job for me. I will continue to be proactive and have a high level of accountability in my work. I hope that people will still want that human connection with writing and that relationships that have been forged with my clients based on trust will continue.

AI: That emphasis on human connection and the trust you've built with clients is really compelling. It sounds like you see those relationships as something uniquely valuable that you bring to the work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining control while still leveraging AI as a collaborator, and how you're thinking about preserving that human element even as the technology evolves.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so! Thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative assistant while maintaining creative control, and your thoughtful perspective on balancing efficiency gains with concerns about the future of the field, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits you're seeing and the very real concerns you have. Take care!
