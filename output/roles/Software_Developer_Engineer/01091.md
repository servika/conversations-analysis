Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use it for simple or repetitive tasks for which AI could complete them easily and quickly. Occasionally, I will use AI to complete more complex tasks such as completing code, finding the source of a bug, or providing a method signature.

AI: That's helpful context. Tell me more about those simple or repetitive tasks - what are some specific examples of what you're having AI handle in that category?

User: Converting raw data from a table into a graph, generating excel cell scripts, or reformatting swathes of code without changing the content.

AI: I see - so data visualization, Excel formulas, and code reformatting. When you mention these tasks that AI could complete "easily and quickly," I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle code creation and documentation myself, as I find that AI performs poorly in these aspects. AI does not often create good self-documenting code, and does not create good, explanatory documentation in the format that would be needed when fitting into a huge, dynamic codebase such as the one at work. Additionally, there would be a breach of privacy and ethical concerns if more sensitive work was done with AI, as a third-party company would have access to some parts of sensitive company data.

AI: That's really insightful - you're drawing distinctions based on both quality concerns and privacy considerations. When you do use AI for those tasks you mentioned earlier - like the data visualization or code reformatting - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I don't tend to delegate any tasks, I guide the AI to producing the exact answer I want, and then check it carefully for factual errors.

AI: So you're taking a very hands-on approach - guiding and then verifying. That sounds like careful oversight. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: It hasn't. My workplace does not encourage the use or promote AI whatsoever, despite a divison of my company producing an AI product. Simultaneously, my workplace nor my colleagues discuss AI, or discourage it.

AI: That's fascinating - a hands-off approach even within a company that has an AI division. So it sounds like you've developed your own approach to using AI at work without much organizational guidance either way.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When struggling to understand a specific topic within my field of work, I asked AI the answer to a question I was struggling with. It was a niche question, and the AI answered poorly, leading to some frustration.

AI: Tell me more about that situation - what made the AI's answer poor? Was it inaccurate information, or was there something else about the response that didn't meet your needs?

User: The answer was poor as it lacked critical information which I later learned from internal documentation of this tool. While this information was semi-public, the AI could not have known this easily, and lacked the prerequisite knowledge to answer with enough detail.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like the AI was missing crucial domain-specific knowledge that only existed in your company's internal resources. Given experiences like that, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't consider it deeply, as I don't think AI will be capable of the nuances of all the job aspects of a software engineer. AI has yet to impress me in documentation, self-documenting code, test-driven development, critical business deployment, or requirements analysis. AI is good at coding, and it may replace some aspects of this sector, but I don't think it will replace other skills that I have as a software engineer.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on where you see the boundaries of AI capability. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision my relationship with AI remaining roughly the same. I may begin to delegate more simple tasks to AI as I begin to trust the output it can produce more, but the human element is the most important element to me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the distinction between tasks where AI excels versus the more nuanced aspects of software engineering that require human judgment.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining careful oversight of AI outputs, the importance of domain-specific knowledge, and your thoughtful approach to where AI fits versus where human expertise remains essential will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
