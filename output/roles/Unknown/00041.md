Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions, sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I am currently investigating the potential of novel compounds isolated from Goldenseal (*Hydrastis canadensis*) to reverse resistance to the antibiotic Tetracycline in E. coli. I have just submitted my research proposal and start my research soon. The bacteria I have chosen to study is *E.Coli *NCTC 12241, a K-12 derivative. For routine culturing, the bacteria will be grown in LB broth or on agar plates. The antibiotic that will be tested for their ability to inhibit or kill the bacteria is tetracycline. This will be used in both MIC and disk diffusion assays to evaluate antibacterial effectiveness. Goldenseal will be ground using a mortar and pestle in 100% ethanol and incubated for 4 hours to extract phytochemicals. The mixture will then be filtered through the Whatman No 1 filter paper. The resulting filtrate will be evaporated to dryness, and the residue will be reconstituted in DMSO to a final concentration of 10mg/ml. Before experimental use, the solution will be sterilised by filtration through a 0.2μm filter. Overnight bacterial cultures will be diluted to an absorbance of 0.1 at 600nm and distributed into 96-well plates at 100 μl per well. Antibiotic and natural product extract dilutions will be prepared separately in sterile 96-well plates, and 100 μl of each dilution will be added to the bacterial cultures. Following a 24-hour incubation at 37 °C, absorbance at 600nm will be recorded using a microplate spectrophotometer. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) will be defined as the lowest concentration of tetracycline that completely inhibits bacterial growth at this time point. Paper discs measuring 5mm in diameter will be soaked with 10µl of either an aqueous tetracycline solution or a natural product extract dissolved in DMSO, then left to dry. LB agar plates (90mm, antibiotic-free) will be uniformly inoculated with bacterial cultures to form a lawn, and the prepared disks will be placed onto the agar surface approximately 3cm apart. After 24 hours of incubation at 37 °C, zones of inhibition around the disks will be measured using a ruler. I will then be able to see the effect of goldenseal and compare it with tetracycline. The experiment will be repeated 4 times for repeatability and accuracy. Major measurements include Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, defined as the lowest concentration of tetracycline that completely inhibits bacterial growth at this time point, which is assessed by measuring optical density at 600nm after 24 hours of incubation. Next is absorbance, which is used to quantify bacterial growth in liquid culture; a spectrophotometer will measure absorbance at 600nm to determine growth levels in each well. Finally, the zone of inhibition will evaluate the antibacterial effect, by measuring the diameter of the clear zone around each disk (tetracycline alone, goldenseal alone, or both). This reflects the extent of bacterial growth inhibition. Comparisons of two means will be carried out using student's T-test, more than two with ANOVA and Dunnet's post-test.

AI: That's a fascinating research project - investigating how natural compounds might help combat antibiotic resistance is such important work. I can see you've thought through the methodology very thoroughly, from the extraction process all the way through to your statistical analysis plan.

Now I'm curious - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: well, this is my research proposal, so I am yet to do the research. But planning, I would probably use AI as guidance for helping me calculate concentrations and dilutions, to write up a data table, data analysis and for my comparisons of measn using student's t test etc

AI: That makes sense - so you're thinking ahead about where AI might fit into your workflow once you start the actual research. 

Tell me more about using AI for calculating concentrations and dilutions. What draws you to that particular application - is it something about the complexity of the calculations, or more about double-checking your work?

User: mainly just to check my work, as it is an integral part of my research and if the calculations are wrong, my research will be inaccurate. I mainly use AI to double-check my work as I don't fully have faith in it.

AI: That's really interesting - you mention that you don't fully have faith in AI, yet you're planning to use it as a check on your work. Can you tell me more about that tension? What makes you feel like it's useful for double-checking even though you don't fully trust it?

User: More just to validate my work and to have a second opinion, however i am becoming more trusting.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using it for validation while your trust is still developing. You mentioned you're becoming more trusting. What's been changing your perspective on that? Have you had particular experiences with AI that are building that trust?

User: Yes, whenever I use it to check my work it has never faulted. I also find ai quite creative, when I ask for ideas regarding my research it gives some interesting ideas.

AI: That's great that it's been consistently reliable for you in checking your work - that kind of track record definitely builds confidence. And it sounds like you've discovered AI can be helpful beyond just verification.

When you say it gives you interesting ideas for your research, can you give me an example of the kind of creative input you've gotten? What did that look like?

User: For example, when I was looking for a plant to use for my research, it gave me some very unique plants I hadn't heard of, but also backed its answers up, explaining why it would be good for my research.

AI: That sounds like it was really helpful in your research planning. We're about a third of the way through our conversation now.

Thinking about the parts of your research process where you haven't considered using AI - like maybe the hands-on lab work, the actual experimental procedures, or interpreting your final results - what's kept you from thinking about trying AI there?

User: I do my research at a university lab, hence we don't have the equipment to be able to use AI for hands-on lab work or the actual experimental procedures. Though I do use AI to help me interpret my final result by finding patterns in the data.

AI: That makes perfect sense about the equipment limitations for hands-on work. It sounds like you are already planning to use AI for interpreting results and finding patterns in data though.

When you do use AI for finding patterns in your data, how do you verify or validate what it tells you? What's your process for making sure those patterns it identifies are actually meaningful?

User: By doing my own research on Google Scholar or PubMed, using past research articles to justify similar results.

AI: That's a solid approach - cross-referencing with the published literature to validate AI insights. 

Here's my last main question: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't or can't, what would that be and why?

User: If AI could generate me a list of existing references of research articles that I can use in my analysis and introduction, it would be most helpful. It is extremely time-consuming to find research papers that fit my research and what I'm looking for, and sometimes I feel as though better-suited documents exist but I cannot find them. If AI could generate a list of material that is relevant to my research, it would be very helpful and save those in the field vast amounts of time and therefore money. Currently, if I ask AI, it generates fake articles or makes up references which don't exist.

AI: That would be incredibly valuable - having AI generate accurate, real references would definitely save researchers like yourself enormous amounts of time. The fact that it currently makes up citations is clearly a major barrier.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on using AI as a validation tool while your trust develops, and especially your insights about the citation problem, were particularly helpful for us to understand.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for validation and cross-checking while building trust gradually, and especially your point about the critical need for accurate literature search capabilities, really help us understand how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's clear you've found a thoughtful balance - leveraging AI's strengths for calculations and creative input while maintaining rigorous verification practices through traditional academic sources. That approach seems both practical and scientifically sound.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
