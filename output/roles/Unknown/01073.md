Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me. Let's get started

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As an audiobook narrator, I don't use AI specifically for narrating tasks. However, if I want an explanation of a word, the pronunciation of a word, or want to get an idea of if a sentence has to be edited to make more sense, I would use AI for that reason.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI more as a research and clarification tool rather than for the core narration work itself. 

Can you walk me through what a typical situation looks like when you turn to AI for help with pronunciation or sentence clarity? What prompts you to seek that assistance?

User: Correct. And since Chatbots like ChatGPT have voice-functions, I would either use the live voice feature to get the correct pronunciation within a conversation, or I would ask for the right pronunciation, then press the "audio" button on Chat GPT to get an idea of how it's pronounced. If that doesn't work, I would check YouTube to get the right pronunciation. Pronunciation is very crucial in narration

AI: That makes a lot of sense - pronunciation accuracy would be absolutely critical in your work. It sounds like you've developed a systematic approach with multiple fallback options.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Absolutely. I do the narration, editing, and mastering myself for audiobook narration, as there are settings needed in order to get the ideal sound, noise floor, etc.

It may be possible for AI to help with editing and mastering, and I wouldn't be surprised, but I haven't looked into those options.

AI: That's a great point about the technical expertise required for those specialized audio tasks. It sounds like you maintain control over the aspects that require your professional judgment and technical knowledge.

When you do use AI for work - like those pronunciation checks or sentence clarity questions - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have back-and-forth conversations with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask specific questions and get what you need quickly?

User: It would usually be me asking a specific question to get what I need quickly, then get back to work. When working on a narration task, I don't have detailed conversations with AI at those points.

AI: That sounds very focused and efficient - you're using AI as a quick reference tool rather than a collaborator. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other narrators you know approach AI differently, or is there any particular attitude toward AI tools in the audiobook industry?

User: Other narrators have a scared or angry view of AI, thinking that it will replace their work in the future or that it already has a lot of the time, causing upset.

AI: That's a really significant perspective difference. You seem to have found a way to use AI as a tool that enhances your work without threatening it, while your colleagues see it more as competition.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was one time I came across a pronunciation for a word that didn't seem right...so I checked another source and the other source was correct. That was not satisfying initially.

AI: That sounds frustrating - especially when pronunciation accuracy is so crucial to your work. 

What happened after you discovered the AI had given you the incorrect pronunciation? How did that experience affect how you approach using AI for pronunciation help going forward?

User: It made me realize that I couldn't use it as the only source, but I could use it initially, then follow-up with a YouTube video to verify if it is correct or not.

AI: That's a really practical adaptation - building in that verification step. It sounds like you've developed a healthy skepticism while still finding AI useful as a starting point.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given what you mentioned about other narrators' concerns?

User: I feel like it's still necessary for an audiobook narrator to have the essential skills to effectively perform their word, knowing how to use their DAW, use punch-and-roll, have good mic technique, and learn other aspects of it, since we are not just narrators, but producers. Also, I don't know if AI will be able to replicate the tones, passion, voice acting, range and overall humanness of a narrator, so I don't know if AI could take over that.

But still, this is a concern that other narrators have, since it's cheaper to use AI instead of getting a human narrator.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you're focusing on the uniquely human elements that you bring to the work. You seem to see a distinction between what AI can do efficiently versus the creative and emotional aspects that require human skill.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll find new ways to incorporate it, or do you expect it will remain primarily this focused, reference-tool approach?

User: For now, I see it as a reference tool. But I can see the possibility of AI being used to automate the editing and mastering process

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've found a practical middle ground - using AI as a reference tool while maintaining the human elements that make your work valuable, and how you've adapted your verification process after that pronunciation experience.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's all. Thank you

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI as a helpful reference tool while maintaining the uniquely human aspects of your craft will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've navigated both the practical benefits and limitations of AI in such a specialized field. Thanks again!
