Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI in legal research and also in just general searching on the internet.

AI: That's interesting - legal research and general internet searching. Tell me more about what that looks like in practice. When you're doing legal research, what specific things are you asking AI to help you with?

User: For legal research the AI used by Lexis Nexis will make searching easier as you can now ask a question that you need answered for a brief or other argument instead of just searching for cases by legal terms.

AI: That sounds like a significant shift from traditional legal research methods. When you're using that Lexis Nexis AI to ask questions for your briefs, how does that change your research process compared to the old way of searching by legal terms?

User: The process is streamlined significantly.

AI: Can you walk me through what "streamlined significantly" means for you? What used to take a long time that now happens more quickly?

User: In the old days I would first have to try to think of the legal theories or terms that were applicable to my specific issue which would take time.  Then you would search for cases that had that term.  Then you would have to read through those cases to see if the usage of that term was relevant to your issue.  Now you can just type in your issue and the AI will quickly bring up cases that are responsive to your issue.

AI: That's a fascinating change - going from having to anticipate the right legal terminology to just describing your actual issue. When the AI brings up those responsive cases, what do you do next? Do you still read through them yourself, or has that part of the process changed too?

User: The AI will also provide a summary of the case which I will read first to further eliminate irrelevant cases.  But at the end of the day I still need to read the entire case if I am going to use it in a brief.  To not do so would be unethical in my opinion.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using the AI summary as a filter but maintaining that ethical standard of reading the full case yourself. It sounds like you've found a way to let AI help with efficiency while keeping the critical analysis in your own hands.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Lexis (and others) have AI that will draft briefs and arguments for you.  I am still not comfortable using those services as I feel like it is an abdication of a lawyer's professional responsibility.  Plus there have been instances in the past where lawyers did rely on AI to draft briefs for them and it turned out that the AI made up cases.  This resulted in serious consequences for those attorneys.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - using AI as a research tool versus letting it actually draft your arguments. The cases you're referencing where AI fabricated citations definitely made headlines in the legal community.

What is it about the brief writing process specifically that feels like it crosses that line of professional responsibility for you? How do you think about where that boundary sits?

User: It's kind of like plagiarism.  It is one thing to have someone (or AI) draft arguments for you to include in your brief which is your work product.  But it is entirely different to just have someone (or AI) draft something for you that you just put your name on and hand in.  Similar to using AI to write a research paper for you in school, etc.  I know that educators now use AI to detect AI created papers so it probably will not be too long before courts are using AI to detect AI created briefs.

AI: That plagiarism analogy is really compelling - the distinction between using AI to help inform your own work versus having it create the work product itself. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like with the Lexis research you're collaborating with it throughout the process - you ask questions, review summaries, then do your own reading. Is that how you generally approach working with AI tools?

User: For research yes.  For general internet browser searches I will use the AI summary first to see if my search terms are actually going to send me to sites that have the answer that I am looking for.  After that, if the AI summary seems to have what I am looking for I will go to the sources that they are siting.

AI: That's a smart way to validate what you're getting from AI - using it as an initial filter but then going to the actual sources. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people in your firm talking about these tools, or do you find yourself navigating this pretty independently?

User: We talked about it at length after one of those cases came down where an attorney was sanctioned for submitting an AI created brief with false citations.  Otherwise we do not really discuss it but I know that different attorneys will use AI differently.  Some refuse to use it at all while others use it extensively (including initial drafting of arguments).

AI: That's really interesting that there's such a range - from complete refusal to extensive use including drafting. It sounds like your firm is letting people find their own comfort level rather than having strict policies.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time I used it for research was extremely satisfying because it cut down my research time significantly.

AI: What made that first experience so satisfying? Can you tell me more about what that research session was like and how much time you think it actually saved you?

User: I was researching a legal point for a brief that I was writing but the legal terms were not as apparent to me so instead of guessing on a few terms that I thought would be applicable I just typed in the point heading that I wanted to use and the AI quickly came up with relevant cases.

AI: That sounds like it removed a lot of the guesswork and uncertainty from the process. You mentioned it cut down your research time significantly - do you have a sense of how much time something like that used to take versus how long it takes now?

User: In that situation I would say that it cut at least an hour off of my research time because in addition to eliminating the guesswork the case summaries also allowed me to further hone in on the specific cases that I wanted to read and ultimately use in my brief.

AI: An hour saved on a single research task is substantial - that really adds up over time. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am not concerned about it in my line of work because at the end of the day AI is not permitted to draft and submit arguments to court.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - that there are certain professional gatekeeping functions that AI simply can't perform. But even in areas where AI is helping with research and case summaries, do you think about whether your research skills might change over time, or is that not something that concerns you?

User: I think that AI will help with researching over time so it is a good thing in my field.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding how you use it, or do you think you'll pretty much stick with the current approach of using it for research but not drafting?

User: I probably will eventually relent and take a shot at using it for drafting.  But if it ends up taking more time because I end up rewriting the entire draft to put it in my own words than that will not be time saved it will be time wasted.

AI: That's a really practical way to think about it - the true test being whether it actually saves time in the end, not just at the initial drafting stage. It sounds like you'd want to see a clear efficiency gain before changing your current approach.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on where you draw the ethical line between using AI as a research tool versus having it create work product.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing else from my experiences.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you navigate the balance between efficiency and professional responsibility, and the way you've integrated AI into your research workflow while maintaining clear ethical boundaries, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your approach today.

User: You're welcome.

AI: Thank you so much! Have a great rest of your day.
