Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great! I have no questions at this time.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in public accounting/audit, so much of the AI that I incorporate involves using it to improve efficiency around analyze large sets of data quickly (such as journal entries and trial balances). I also use it to help automate certain emails and calendar appointments, as I have to host may walkthrough meetings.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across different aspects of your audit work. 

When you mention analyzing large sets of data like journal entries and trial balances, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does the AI help you work through that data?

User: The Controllers Department of whichever client we are working with will send us the log of all journal entries for the fiscal period (usually quarter-end, or year-end). We upload this to an AI system/platform, such as MindBridge AI and tag key dates, descriptions, and terms that could be considered "high risk" (for instance, journal entries made on weekends or holidays). The AI platform quickly identifies different "moderate" to "high" risk journal entries to investigate further, as well as the overall risk profile.

AI: That's fascinating - so the AI is essentially acting as your first line of screening to flag potentially problematic entries based on patterns and risk indicators.

Tell me more about what happens after MindBridge identifies those moderate to high-risk entries. How do you work with those results - do you take the AI's risk assessment at face value, or do you have your own process for evaluating what it flags?

User: We tend to have our own process for evaluating what the system flags. Since we use the AI platforms for fraud management, we don't want to immediately assume that the client is committing fraud, as this could negatively affect the working relationship. We instead try to add layers of human judgment, such as first inquiring about the journal entries we identified with our main point of contact at the business.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're being very thoughtful about maintaining those client relationships while still doing your due diligence.

When you're adding those layers of human judgment, what kinds of things are you looking for that the AI might miss? Are there situations where you've disagreed with the AI's risk assessment - either thinking something it flagged was actually fine, or catching something it didn't flag?

User: There have been times where the AI has flagged something as "irregular" or "unusual" and we end up deeming it "OK", not resulting in a material variance. This is usually after we do a deeper dive/investigation into the particular journal entry/entries flagged, and decide that the description is reasonable. Or, we inquire further with the client and get assurance that the journal entry is in line with their business processes.

AI: That's really valuable insight - it sounds like the AI is quite sensitive, which is probably better than missing things, but it means you need to do that human verification step.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your audit work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, we definitely try to adjust the settings of the AI platform so that it is highly sensitive and can flag more accounting entries than needed so that nothing is missed, but then allowing us to make the final decision. When composing emails with specific follow-up questions for the client, I do still prefer to write the message myself instead of having AI do it. This is often because I've built a friendly yet professional connection with the client, and want to make sure the email does not come across as accusatory or "robotic".

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making there - using AI for the data analysis where sensitivity is key, but keeping the human touch for those client communications where relationship and tone matter so much.

When you do write those follow-up emails yourself, what is it about your own writing that feels different from what AI might produce? Is it specific phrases you use, or something more about the overall approach?

User: I tend to include details based on my relationship with the client that I feel would be difficult to the AI to reproduce, or it would be difficult to define in parameters with the AI to achieve the same effect. However, I could see implementing AI to compose draft emails and then quickly re-reading them to make sure the tone is appropriating. However, between detailing the specific request to the AI model and having to review its output, this sometimes feels more time consuming than simply just writing the email myself.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - the overhead of setting up the AI to get the right tone and context sometimes isn't worth it when you can just write it yourself more efficiently.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to delegate complete tasks for the AI to handle independently at the start of an audit, particularly uploading the client data support and asking the AI to analyze for initial risk management purposes.

AI: So you're using AI more as a standalone processor at the beginning to get that initial risk landscape, rather than going back and forth with it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are you all using similar approaches, or have you noticed different styles among your team?

User: Although my workplace was open to adopting AI to help streamline processes, there still seems to be some pushback, as AI is seen as the "job killer" or "job replacer" for accountants and auditors. However, I view it more as a way to reduce the amount of hours individuals focus on data entry and marking up client support. This would allow us to increase the number of audits we do in a year, as well as allow us more to focus on judgment calls (such as providing the final opinion on financial statements).

AI: That's an interesting tension you're describing - between seeing AI as a threat versus seeing it as freeing you up for the more complex, judgment-based work that really requires human expertise.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: After any audit, we usually provide a list of suggestions/recommendations for the client to implement in the final report (especially in regards to operational and performance audits). We have a program to track whether the client/department has properly implemented the suggestions post-audit over a specified timeline (such as 1 month, 3 months, etc.). This requires many check-in emails that are tracked in an Excel log. I was able to utilize AI to somewhat automate this process, including having it draft emails in this situation (which I feel more comfortable with as they follow a standard template).

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying use case - automating those routine follow-up emails where you have a standard template to work from, rather than the more nuanced client relationship emails we talked about earlier.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I definitely still try to keep up with technological advancements in the accounting industry, including my Microsoft Excel skills. However, I have dedicated less time to learning how to code, as I feel AI will likely be able to handle certain accounting coding tasks.

AI: That's a strategic approach - staying sharp on the tools that complement your work while recognizing where AI might handle the more technical coding aspects.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I feel that we will continue to implement AI tools that further reduce the amount of time spent on actual test work during audits, particularly marking up client support with Excel and Adobe Acrobat/PDFs. For instance, DataSnipper is an AI-powered audit tool that extracts, cross-references, and verifies data with the Intelligent Automation Platform in Excel.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as that highly sensitive first screening tool while you maintain control over the final judgment calls and client relationships.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're strategically integrating AI into different parts of your audit workflow - from the initial data analysis to automating routine follow-ups while maintaining that human touch for sensitive client communications - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your thoughtful approach to this technology.
