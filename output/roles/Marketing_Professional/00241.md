Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds perfectly fine, no further questions on my end.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Predominantly, I use AI for copywriting purposes and creative ideation. These are two tasks that take up a lot of my day.

AI: Tell me more about that copywriting work. What specific types of copy are you creating with AI's help?

User: It ranges from website articles, SEO-driven webpages and Meta ad campaigns.

AI: That's a broad range of copywriting work. When you're working on something like a Meta ad campaign versus an SEO webpage, how does your process with AI differ between those different types of projects?

User: Mostly in the prompt generation space. Ensuring that AI understands the purpose of the task and the outcome required.

AI: Can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? How do you craft those prompts differently when you need AI to understand the specific outcome you're after?

User: Sure thing. So for an SEO driven webpage, I will use a prompt like: "You are an SEO and local automotive marketing expert specialising in the New Zealand market. Review the following webpage for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) optimisation. Provide your assessment in a structured format with scores (1–10) for each category. Then calculate the SEO score (out of 50), GEO score (out of 50), and a total score (out of 100). Conclude with strengths, weaknesses, and actionable recommendations tailored to an NZ automotive dealership. Page to review: [REDACTED]"

AI: That's a very detailed and structured prompt. I can see how you're setting up the AI with specific expertise and asking for quantified feedback. 

When you get that structured assessment back from AI, what do you typically do with those recommendations? Do you implement them yourself, or does that lead to another round of AI collaboration?

User: I'll review the pages and then task AI with assisting on pages that need additional work

AI: So it sounds like you're using AI in multiple rounds - first for assessment, then for the actual improvements. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your copywriting work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Not really - I will always double check the information before updating a webpage or an article as sometimes AI might get something wrong.

AI: That's interesting - so you're comfortable using AI across the board but you maintain that oversight role. 

When you do find that AI has gotten something wrong during your review process, what kinds of errors do you typically catch? Are there patterns to what it tends to miss or misunderstand?

User: As I work in the new vehicle retailing sector, if we are doing an article about a new vehicle launch, sometimes AI will mix up the specifications or vehicle's model name. This is usually because a vehicle is launched globally but may be slightly different in other markets. So AI is using other public information about a vehicle

AI: That makes perfect sense - AI might pull from international specs when you need New Zealand-specific details. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I always collaborate with it throughout a task

AI: What does that collaboration look like as you work through a project? Can you walk me through how that back-and-forth typically unfolds?

User: Generally, it's an initial prompt where I mention the task and the objection of the work. Ensure AI understands this, then I put out a follow-up prompt with the specific task. Once AI gives a response, I'll read and refine it with AI (e.g. that vehicle model is wrong, include these specifications, talk about this point of difference etc). Then once I'm happy with it, I'll add it to my webpage or Meta campaign and further refine it slightly

AI: That's a really clear process - it sounds like you have this systematic approach where you build understanding, then refine iteratively, and still do final touches yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace culture is really big on the importance of AI and adopting it to improve our workflows. If my culture was different, I'd still be using it but not as much

AI: That's really helpful to understand. When you say you'd still use it but not as much in a different culture, what do you think would hold you back? What is it about your current workplace that makes you feel comfortable using AI more extensively?

User: I think it's a matter of whether a workplace invests in AI or not. Because mine does, it's easy to learn new tools and showcase them to the team. If I didn't have that luxury, I'd feel uncomfortable telling my team about the time I spend learning new things about AI

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that organizational support creates space for experimentation and learning. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One aspect is artwork generation. It's a lot of back and fourth trying to get artwork updated with AI. There's either a lot of mistakes or it comes out incredibly basic. That side of things is usually just done on photoshop myself.

AI: So artwork generation is where you hit that frustration point - sounds like the iterative process that works well for copywriting doesn't translate as smoothly to visual work.

When you do switch back to Photoshop for that artwork, how does that feel compared to the collaborative process you have with AI for writing? Is it more satisfying to have that direct control?

User: I think it is, but it takes a lot longer to get things done which can be frustrating

AI: That tension between control and efficiency is really interesting. You get better results with direct control in Photoshop, but at the cost of time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really! As my role is incredibly broad, I don't think there will be a time where AI would take over my role. At the end of the day, someone still needs to monitor and control AI - I want to make sure I am that person.

AI: That's a confident perspective - positioning yourself as the one who guides and oversees the AI rather than being replaced by it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: AI is advancing at such a rapid rate, it's hard to answer that question. I think it will become such an important part in my role that I'll collaborate with it more than my own team.

AI: That's a striking vision - collaborating more with AI than with your human colleagues. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how workplace culture creates space for AI experimentation and your systematic approach to collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That is all on my end thank you

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the iterative collaboration process, the importance of workplace culture in AI adoption, and that interesting tension between control and efficiency in different types of tasks will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thanks

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
