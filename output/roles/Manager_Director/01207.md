Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, no questions

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I work in medical research, specifically clinical trials.  The "initial idea" for a given medicine has already taken place some time before it passes on to the team I work in. We take over an eligible medication as it moves on to phase 2. For a recent compound, we designed a dose finding trial and  crossover trial for evidence of efficacy with a built in futility analysis. Parts of the team find partner sites for the trials, other parts determine how many patients are needed to give a reasonable chance of detecting efficacy if it is present, another part of the team deals with randomisation and blinding, another part of the team with data control and so on.

AI: That's really helpful context - thank you. It sounds like there are many distinct phases and team roles involved in moving a compound through phase 2 trials.

Thinking about all those different components you mentioned - from dose finding design to partner site selection, statistical planning, randomization, data control - where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Primarily with literature searches to look for existing clinical trials related to the mechanism, similar compounds or similar study designs in order to help the statisticians refine their calculations to minimise the number of patients needed to answer a given question. This helps reduce clinical risk and cost. Other potential uses of AI don't appear to have been adopted at this time. I am unclear if this relates to capability or the need for blinding etc.

AI: That's interesting - using AI for literature searches to inform statistical calculations makes a lot of sense for optimizing trial design.

For those literature searches specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding relevant trials and information.

User: Essentially we do both. Our company has access to online databases to look for studies and we search through those with traditional search queries as we always have, but we additionally interrogate AI to look for any studies we may have missed or which could be related in unusual ways.

AI: That's a great approach - using both methods as a safety net. When you interrogate AI to look for studies you might have missed or unusual connections, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: We go and look at the studies the AI found. The AI is used to provide suggestions.

AI: That makes complete sense - treating AI as a suggestion generator rather than a definitive source.

Thinking about the other parts of your research workflow that you mentioned - the dose finding design, partner site selection, randomization procedures, data control - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: It is a combination of things. Patient confidentiality when it comes to data control and QC (probably the area that AI could do the most for). For statistical analysis and coding there is a requirement for 2 individuals to independently generate the work then check if they agree. I know one person uses AI to check their code if they run into an error they aren't sure of, but they are required to supply a human generated output. Trial design will probably always be human driven because of the implied risks in clinical trials. I think, probably, most of the issue lies with confidentiality, blinding and the intensely risk averse nature of drug development. It would probably require a bespoke tool with appropriate hard coded blinding and data safety to start using AI for the most AI applicable tasks.

AI: That's a really insightful breakdown of the different barriers at play - confidentiality requirements, regulatory validation needs, and the risk-averse nature of the field. The point about needing bespoke tools with built-in safeguards is particularly interesting.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Data control and validation. The nature of drug development is a slow burn of preparatory work and ongoing validation whilst you get people through the trials followed by an intense flurry of work once the database is locked and unblinding occurs with every delay being a massive issue since it is the portion of development we can control and the clock is always ticking on patents. Data management have large volumes of repetitive data to validate and things can be missed which causes significant delay. AI seems to me well suited to validating reems of data if given appropriate instructions. Or at least with a different likely error set to human review, so increasing the likelihood of something being flagged and dealt with. There is also the possibility of picking up fabricated data earlier, since AI can potentially spot suspicious patterns of numbers earlier, something that often doesn't occur until the statisticians get hold of the data late on.

AI: That's a compelling use case - the combination of volume, time pressure, and the need for pattern recognition in data validation does seem like a natural fit for AI capabilities. And the idea of AI having a different error profile than humans to catch things that might slip through is really thoughtful.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on the regulatory constraints and the potential for AI in data validation were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No, for the portion of drug development I am involved in, that seems like it covers most applicable aspects. Someone in drug discovery or some of the other groups that liase with us such as manufacturing or pharmacokinetics would have different perspectives. So I just want you to be aware this is limited to a phase 2 clinical trial team perspective, not drug development as a whole.

AI: That's a really important distinction to make - thank you for clarifying the scope of your perspective. It's valuable to understand how AI integration varies across different stages of drug development.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between AI's potential in data validation and the regulatory/confidentiality barriers really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into highly regulated scientific work. The point about needing bespoke tools with built-in safeguards was particularly valuable for understanding the path forward.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!
