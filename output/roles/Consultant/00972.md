Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good. No, I do not have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Here are some ways how I may use AI for my work tasks:

AI: I notice you said "may use" - that's interesting phrasing. Could you walk me through what actually happens in a typical workday for you? When do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I hit return thinking I would go the the next line. Let me try again. Here are some ways how I may use AI for my work tasks. My accounting expertise is in a job cost and percentage of completion environment. Therefore, an example may be to ask AI to help me explain to a client why, according to GAAP, payment they receive in advance or work is not revenue until it is earned. It is instead a liability on the Income Statement. Although, this is very clear to me as a job cost managing accountant, explaining it to a client can be tricky. Or, I may ask AI to refresh my memory on an an AIA contract document for something like retainage or release of lien requirements. I also work in marketing. Therefore, I may ask AI to help me draft a product or service description in a way that is most likely to produce customers given various criteria. Or, to write some consultant advice via an email. The ways I use AI can vary since I am self-employed and may have varying types of work at any time.

AI: That's really helpful - I can see you're using AI across quite different areas of your work. 

When you're explaining those complex accounting concepts to clients, like the advance payment example you mentioned, how do you typically work with AI on that? Do you give it the basic scenario and let it draft a full explanation, or do you collaborate with it more step-by-step to get the explanation just right?

User: I will provide AI and explanation and ask AI to revise it so that someone who does not have my expertise can understand it more clearly. So, the latter would be more typical; I would collaborate with it step-by-step until a version is produced that hits the mark of my intent.

AI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense. I'm curious about the other side of things - are there certain tasks in your accounting or marketing work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I assume there are many ways that AI could help with accounting type tasks. But I am not sure what they would be. I have a certain way of handling my work. I use Excel a great deal. I suppose if I were to give AI some financial data and ask for outcomes, that may be useful. But I don't feel comfortable enough with AI to trust it.

AI: That's really insightful - the trust factor seems important to you. When you say you don't feel comfortable enough to trust AI with financial data, what specifically concerns you about that? Is it accuracy, or something else?

User: Given that what I do has to meet GAAP and can have an impact on a person's or businesses tax reporting, ability to obtain financing, etc. I need to feel confident in what I present. Therefore, relying on my own programs and knowledge is optimal at this time in both accuracy and consultation.

AI: That makes complete sense - those are high-stakes situations where accuracy is critical. 

Shifting gears a bit, you mentioned being self-employed with varying types of work. How has working independently influenced the way you approach using AI? Do you think your AI usage would be different if you were working in a traditional office environment with colleagues?

User: I don't feel working independently has influenced my approach to using AI verses what I would envision if I were in a more traditional employment situation. If I were in more administrative and marketing style roles for the majority of whether employed traditionally or independently, I could envision consulting AI for marketing communications more often.

AI: That's interesting that you don't see much difference between independent and traditional work settings for your AI use. 

I'd love to hear about a specific experience - can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm struggling to provide a specific experience. Maybe the time when a client could not understand why the work I provided took twice as many hours as they expected. And AI was a useful tool in helping me explain it congenially to the client. Since this would be frustrating to deal with the client having unrealistic expectation, using AI is satisfying in these type circumstances.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like AI really helped you navigate a potentially difficult client conversation. When you used AI to help explain the hours to your client, what was it about the AI's approach that made the explanation more congenial than what you might have written on your own?

User: I am a matter of fact type personality. I even test as a rare personality on the Meyers-Briggs personality tests. So, I'm always mindful that most people work off of emotion more than me. I have found AI to be helpful in these areas to help me improve my communication style for the average type person, whether it be for a technical matter or handling other business at hand.

AI: That's fascinating - so AI is essentially helping you bridge that communication gap between your very direct, analytical style and what resonates with most people emotionally. 

As you continue using AI this way, how do you think about maintaining your own communication skills? Do you find yourself picking up on some of the approaches AI suggests, or is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, bridging communication gap in style is a good way to put it. I may learn and adapt via AI's assistance, but I have found that even when I think I'm being charitable in the way I communicate, for lack of a better word. I may not always rely on myself and consult AI when something as important as earning a living, or managing other relationships may be at risk.

AI: That's such a thoughtful approach - recognizing where your natural strengths lie and when it's worth getting that extra perspective, especially when the stakes are high.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you become more familiar with it, or expanding into new areas?

User: I don't envision using AI differently over time. But, I realize I may find otherwise as it becomes more ingrained in society and various mediums.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps bridge that communication gap between your analytical style and what resonates emotionally with clients - that's such a practical and valuable application.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't believe so. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a communication bridge, especially in high-stakes professional situations, and your thoughtful approach to where you do and don't feel comfortable leveraging AI will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Does this complete the interview? Are those all of the questions?

AI: Yes, that completes the interview! I covered all the main questions from our interview plan. We discussed:
