Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not have any questions. Please feel free to proceed

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in a research & development setting for a major biopharmaceutical company in cell culture development. Therefore, I use AI for experimental idea generation, randomization, DoE generation, mild data analysis, and as a conversational search engine. I especially like using it as a conversational search engine as I can ask for sources from interesting ideas and gather insights that I may have overlooked due to prior experience with projects providing a source of bias

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across quite a range of research activities. I'm particularly intrigued by your mention of using it as a conversational search engine to counter your own potential bias.

Can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? When you say you use it to gather insights you might have overlooked due to prior project experience, what does that interaction actually look like?

User: Sure. In planning the different parameters or conditions for my experiment that I would like to study, it is easy to bias yourself by studying the things that are well known to affect a process in some way. However, I can make the AI give me ideas that are outside of my immediate attention in one of two ways: 1) I can simply ask it to provide me 10-15 different parameters to study to optimize some value or outcome, or 2) I can ask for 5-10 different parameters and specify the parameters that I've already tested so the AI provides either new ideas or different variations on ideas that I've tried

AI: That's a really clever approach - essentially using AI to expand your experimental thinking beyond your established patterns. 

When the AI suggests these parameters that are outside your immediate attention, how do you typically evaluate whether those suggestions are worth pursuing? Do you find yourself trusting the AI's recommendations, or do you have a particular process for vetting them before incorporating them into your experimental design?

User: Lots of the time the parameters are either something that is well-established in the literature, so I can follow this up with a conversation with the AI about that specific parameter to gather further insights and collect sources. In the event that a paramter is rather unorthodox or novel, I will still further the conversation to gather more information and use my own base knowledge to determine if this is something to pursue further (both in research and application) or is outside the scope of my development work

AI: That's a thoughtful validation process you've developed. It sounds like you're maintaining a balance between staying open to new ideas and applying your own expertise as a filter.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your R&D work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to do a lot of my own document writing, but only because AI hasn't proven to be successful in doing this for me yet. I work on a team at my day job attempting to get our AI model to provide document generation support for multiple teams. Unfortunately, in my function line, it doesn't seem to be able to handle all of the image and table generation that is required for our documents.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like there's a gap between what AI can currently deliver and what your technical documentation requires, especially with the visual elements.

When you do use AI for the tasks it handles well - like experimental idea generation or as that conversational search engine - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth collaboration with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a specific request and let it handle that piece independently?

User: Most likely back-and-forth. Especially for idea generation, where I will gather all possible resources and information prior to actually asking the AI to generate a sample experiment to see what ideas it might have about application before exploring more on my own

AI: That collaborative approach makes a lot of sense for your work. It sounds like you're building up context together before getting to the core request.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned working on a team to get AI document generation support - what's the broader attitude toward AI tools in your organization?

User: My organization is focusing heavily on developing our AI usage over the next 5-10 years. We just created an entire team within the company to drive AI and automation techniques. While there are people in the company that are reluctant to learn an entirely new skillset, most in the company are excited about how AI could make our lives easier and more efficient.

AI: That's a really supportive environment for AI adoption. Given that enthusiasm and organizational commitment, can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used AI to help me figure out a novel parameter that I could use to elicit a specific response in my project at the time. I used a follow up conversation with AI to learn how to apply this parameter to a large experiment and ways to vary this parameter to elicit different levels of response. The result was a record-setting output for my specific project that was actually featured in my promotion paperwork.

AI: That's incredible - what a powerful example of AI helping you achieve a breakthrough that had real career impact. It sounds like that collaborative process of discovery and then application really paid off.

On the flip side of that success, have you had any particularly frustrating experiences with AI in your work? Moments where it didn't deliver what you needed or created complications?

User: I worked for 6 hours straight one day working on a prompt to get the AI to output only one section of a document. I never got the AI to output my desired format or data visualizations.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - spending that much time trying to get AI to do something that should theoretically be straightforward. That experience with document generation really contrasts with your success in experimental design.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given your organization's push toward AI adoption over the next 5-10 years?

User: I've always tried to stay a bit ahead in my scientific career. In graduate school, I taught myself the basics of python coding to help me with using PyMOL. In my postdoctoral fellowship, I taught myself Linux language and R scripting to help me with single-particle cryo-EM structural analysis and elucidation. So far in my current position, I've taught myself Monte-Carlo simulations, furthered my R scripting, and increased my aptitude with statistics and statistical software packages. So, I always try to see the future (so to speak) and stay ahead

AI: That's a really proactive approach - you clearly have a pattern of anticipating technological shifts and building skills ahead of the curve. 

Looking ahead specifically with AI, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Given your track record of staying ahead of trends and your current success using AI as a collaborative research partner, where do you see this heading?

User: I see AI helping with in-lab automation, document generation (basic), and data management. I believe AI will have the ability to streamline our work in a way that gives us time to use our brains for the theoretical knowledge more than just a pair-of-hands.

AI: That's a compelling vision - AI handling more of the operational work so you can focus on the high-level thinking that really requires human expertise and creativity.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to counter your own experimental bias and how you've developed that validation process for evaluating AI suggestions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: This covers most of my interactions at my current day job. Thank you for the interesting questions!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative research partner, especially how you've found ways to leverage it to expand beyond your own cognitive patterns while still applying your scientific judgment, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear about both your successes - like that breakthrough parameter discovery - and the challenges you've faced with document generation. Your proactive approach to staying ahead of technological trends also provides great perspective on how experienced professionals are thinking about AI's evolving role.

Thanks again for participating in our study!
