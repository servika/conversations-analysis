Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to speed up tasks such as calculating, data entry, and writing emails and drafts.

AI: Tell me more about that. When you say "speed up" these tasks, what does that actually look like in practice? Can you walk me through a specific example of how you might use AI for one of these?

User: If I need to write an email, I can quickly write a prompt that states what I'm looking to say, the tone I'd like to use, and what to include or avoid; AI provides me an email draft in less than a minute. If I were to write that email from scratch, I would spend a lot more time writing it, revising, and potentially looking up synonyms for a word if I feel like I'm not getting my point across appropriately.

AI: That's a really clear example. So it sounds like you're still very much involved in the process - you're crafting the prompt and presumably reviewing the draft. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to do any tasks that include confidential information as I worry about how my data is shared.

AI: That makes sense. Beyond confidential information, are there other types of work tasks where you choose to handle things yourself rather than using AI? What drives those decisions for you?

User: Sometimes I prefer to do my own research as AI often provides incorrect information and fact-checking its response takes just as much, or more time, than finding the answer myself using credible sources.

AI: That's an interesting point about the time trade-off with fact-checking. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I never delegate tasks for it to handle completely. I always collaborate with AI to ensure that everything it provides is correct and factual.

AI: How has that collaborative approach worked for you? Can you describe what that back-and-forth process typically looks like when you're working together on something?

User: Let's say I'm working on a complex spreadsheet and am using AI to help me be more efficient. I would first state what I'm trying to accomplish and ask what formula I need. The AI would provide a list of formulas and explain why each one could work; I would pick which formula I thought would work the best and try it in my spreadsheet. Depending on whether or not it was successful, I would continue the conversation with AI and explain what was happening and ask for further help.

AI: That's a really detailed example of how you iterate together. It sounds like you maintain a lot of control and judgment throughout the process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I have seen my colleagues blindly trust AI without checking responses, which has led to issues with incorrect information being provided. This has made me be extra diligent in making sure I always fact-check and read over all AI responses if using them in my work.

AI: That's a powerful example of how workplace experiences shape your approach. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I once used AI to calculate budget figures and it repeatedly made mistakes. The most frustrating part was that I knew the numbers it was providing were wrong but I couldn't figure out where it was making mistakes. I ended up spending more time figuring it out and explaining to the AI what it was doing wrong than I would have if I had done all the calculations myself.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you knew something was off but couldn't pinpoint exactly where. On the flip side, have you had any particularly satisfying experiences using AI at work?

User: Any time I can use AI to finish a task faster is a satisfying experience for me. For example, I had to write a document recently and I used AI to write a rough draft, which I then revised and polished; I saved a significant amount of time by not having to write every word of it myself.

AI: That's great - it sounds like when AI works well for you, it really does deliver on that time-saving promise. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do worry that my writing will get worse if I rely too much on AI to complete my writing tasks for me; it sometimes feels like it takes me longer than it previously did to appropriately explain my thoughts in writing if I'm not using AI for assistance.

AI: That's a really thoughtful observation about the potential impact on your own abilities. Have you made any changes to how you use AI based on that concern, or is it something you're still figuring out how to balance?

User: For tasks such as writing emails, what I've been trying to do as of recently is give AI a very quick and rough draft of what I would like to say and let it polish it for me, instead of relying on it to come up with the entire thing. This ensures that I'm still getting some writing exercise.

AI: That's a smart adaptation - finding a middle ground where you're still exercising those skills while getting the benefits of AI assistance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As of now, I don't see it changing much. I don't think AI will get to a point in the distant future where I will feel comfortable delegating entire tasks to it rather than collaborating and fact-checking its responses.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've adapted your approach based on watching colleagues' experiences and your concern about maintaining your own skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all I had to say.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the importance of maintaining that collaborative approach and being vigilant about fact-checking will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
