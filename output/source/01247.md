Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, that sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

I'd love to start by getting a sense of your work. Can you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: recently, i've been working on a project on reverse-robust computation using chemical reaction networks, or CRNs. i got the idea from my advisor, and got a certain result as part of my project for the graduate class he was teaching, and now i'm trying to generalize the result

AI: That sounds fascinating - chemical reaction networks and reverse-robust computation is quite specialized work. 

Can you tell me a bit more about what that generalization process looks like day-to-day? What are the specific steps you're working through to take that initial result and broaden it?

User: a lot of it is just trying to hunt down theorems in convex analysis (specifically polytopes) that might be useful to some things i want to show about lattice connectivity in polytopes. that and just staring at overleaf, ha

AI: Ha, the classic "staring at overleaf" - I think every researcher knows that feeling well! 

So you're hunting down theorems in convex analysis and working on lattice connectivity proofs. Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: sometimes i ask ai my central research question to see if it can more or less, do a literature review and hunt down relevant theorems/papers/books for me

AI: That's interesting - using AI as a kind of research assistant for finding relevant work. 

Tell me more about how you decided to try AI for that literature review and theorem hunting versus doing it through your traditional approach. What made you think to give it a shot?

User: the main issue is that i don't actually know that much about convex analysis, since i haven't taken a class on it. there is one that's offered but it's only once a year every two years, and it' for undergrads. so i don't really know what keywords to use while searching traditionally, like with google

AI: Ah, that makes a lot of sense - you're working in an area where you don't have the background vocabulary to effectively search on your own. That's a really practical use case.

When you've used AI to help with this theorem hunting and literature review, how do you verify or validate what it produces? How do you know if the theorems or papers it's pointing you toward are actually relevant and reliable?

User: well, i just go find the books and look for the theorems. sometimes ai does produce theorems that don't actually seem to exist, but a lot of the time it does a decent enough job, and finds stuff i had found independently

AI: That's really helpful - so you're using it more as a starting point and then doing your own verification by actually tracking down the sources. It sounds like there's a mix of hits and misses with the accuracy.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the actual proof work, the writing, analyzing your results - what's kept you from trying AI there, if anything?

User: i don't think ai is capable enough to do the proof work; i've tried lobbing some questions from the grad class on CRNs i took and it took a lot of handholding to get it to the right answer. for writing, i think i write well enough that an ai wouldn't really help me out. and for analyzing my results, i do use ai a bit, mostly to talk through my logic

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you've clearly tested AI's boundaries in different areas and found where it works and where it doesn't for your specific needs.

You mentioned using AI a bit to talk through your logic when analyzing results. Can you tell me more about what that looks like? How does that conversation with AI help you in that process?

User: mostly i just treat it like one of my peers, i go over some of the definitions that i'm working with to make sure it has a good idea of the background, then just show it my argument and ask it to look for any flaws

AI: That's a really smart approach - essentially using it as a sounding board or rubber duck to catch potential issues in your reasoning.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't handle well, what would that be and why?

User: hm, i guess making nice looking diagrams in overleaf? it does an okay job but needs a lot of tweaking to get what i want. i'd especially like it if i could just give it the CRN i'm working with and it would just generate the tikz that would represent it

AI: That's such a specific and practical wish - going from your CRN directly to clean TikZ code without all the back-and-forth tweaking. That would definitely save you time on the presentation side.

Those are all my main questions. Your approach of using AI selectively - as a literature starting point when you lack domain vocabulary, and as a logic-checking peer - while being realistic about its limitations for actual proof work really shows a thoughtful integration.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: hm, don't think so. thanks for the conversation

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a research starting point when you lack the domain vocabulary, and treating it like a peer for logic-checking, really help us understand the nuanced ways AI can fit into real scientific work. The practical challenges you mentioned - like AI sometimes generating non-existent theorems, or needing extensive handholding for proof work - are exactly the kind of real-world feedback that's valuable for us to hear.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your workflow and be so candid about what works and what doesn't. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your work on reverse-robust computation!
