Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So at the company I work at Ai is not yet used from day to day. I, however, use Ai while at work to answer work related questions. Tasks I would use it for are for components of materials, and efficiency questions mostly

AI: That's interesting that you're using AI on your own initiative even though your company hasn't formally adopted it yet. 

When you say you use it for components of materials and efficiency questions, could you walk me through a specific example of what that looks like? What kind of question might you ask and how does AI help you with it?

User: Sure, so to sum it up, I work with metals, when working with metals it is important to keep in mind how certain metals can oxidize or rust under certain conditions. Questions like this are great when paired with Ai.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - understanding metal oxidation and corrosion conditions seems like exactly the type of technical knowledge AI could help with quickly.

When you have these kinds of questions about metal properties, do you find yourself going straight to AI first, or do you have other resources you typically check before turning to AI? What draws you to use AI for these particular questions?

User: Ai is so easy to access, if i feel its not a question that only my company would know I would try to use Ai first

AI: That's a practical approach - using AI as your first stop for general technical knowledge that isn't company-specific.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you're comfortable delegating to AI?

User: Specific private tasks about what is done day to day at my company is not used with Ai. I feel that could be a breach of privacy between myself and the company I work for. So to sum it up, there is not always information I am comfortable sharing with Ai.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction you're making between general technical knowledge and company-specific information. It sounds like you have a clear boundary about what feels appropriate to share.

When you do use AI for those general technical questions about metals, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Do you tend to ask one question and get your answer, or do you find yourself having more of a back-and-forth conversation to dig deeper into the topic?

User: While at work I find myself only asking a direct question to get the answer I need then moving on with my day

AI: That sounds very task-focused and efficient - getting what you need and moving on.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you talked with coworkers about using AI, or is it something you're doing more independently?

User: No, this is all independent

AI: So you're really pioneering this on your own at your workplace. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Ai is pretty good at clear answers when it comes to my work speciatly. Its pretty well known (withen an internet search) information that I am typically seeking

AI: It sounds like AI is hitting the mark for you with those straightforward technical questions - giving you reliable information that you could probably find elsewhere but much more efficiently.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given that you're working with technical knowledge that AI handles well?

User: Ai is great with information on metals, but could not take over as my work is production that is not online based

AI: That makes perfect sense - AI can provide you with the technical knowledge you need, but your hands-on production work requires physical presence and real-world application.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your company might eventually adopt AI tools more formally, or do you see yourself continuing to use it independently?

User: At this time I imagine it will be just used independently

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear thinking about the boundaries between what's appropriate to share with AI versus what should stay internal to your company - that's a really practical approach to navigating this new technology.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as an independent resource for technical knowledge while maintaining clear privacy boundaries will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how you've integrated AI into your work routine. Have a great rest of your day!
