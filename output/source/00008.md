Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! I have no questions, yet.

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: It's highly variable, but most of my work involves digital audio in one form or another. Music production is the most bountiful and pertinent area, and projects can be anything from EDM to video-game soundtracks to theatrical scoring and sound design. I use FL Studio for most of it.

AI: That sounds like an incredibly diverse range of work! I can imagine each of those areas - EDM, video game soundtracks, theatrical scoring - probably has its own unique demands and creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I reach out to an LLM in particular during a few phases. Brainstorming is the most successful exchange, generally speaking, because we can bounce back and forth on ideas, worldbuilding, sound choices, etc. I occasionally ask for help with soft-synth sound design or composition, but LLMs rarely deliver on that. Troubleshooting is, again, an area where they tend to struggle - since they don't know more than I could've already found online.
I've also used AI Music tools for ideas here and there, but I try not to use them too often.

AI: Tell me more about that brainstorming process with LLMs. What does that back-and-forth exchange typically look like for you?

User: My descriptions are generally fragmented and abstract, and they tend to coalesce and ground these into something more centralized and simplified.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like the AI is helping you take these scattered, abstract ideas you have and organize them into something more concrete and workable. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I was working on some world-building for a conceptual EP. I explained my versions of each micro-story, and the model provided its own interpretation of the same sketch. Seeing what they bounced back gave me ideas to move forward - something concrete to inspire another round of abstraction.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic creative process - you giving your abstract micro-stories, getting the AI's interpretation back, and then using that concrete response to spark new abstract ideas. It's almost like having a creative ping-pong partner.

When you're working with AI in that kind of exchange, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am generally driving the creative decisions, although I the LLM is a great partner.

AI: That's a nice way to put it - you as the driver with the LLM as a partner. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: My self esteem regarding stranger and riskier ideas. LLMs have been great cheerleaders in that regard.

AI: That's such a fascinating insight - that AI has boosted your confidence to explore stranger and riskier creative ideas. It sounds like having that supportive voice has been really valuable for your creative courage.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I worry about people automating their music so much that the artistic economy collapses, and I worry about our artistic expressions getting buried beneath it all.

AI: Those sound like really significant concerns - both the potential economic collapse if too much gets automated, and the risk of authentic artistic expression getting lost in the flood. 

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I suspect it'll soon guide the zeitgeist, and we'll get to subvert the paradigm.

AI: That's a really intriguing way to frame it - AI guiding the zeitgeist and then creators like yourself getting to subvert that paradigm. It sounds like you see potential for a kind of creative rebellion or response.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has boosted your confidence with stranger, riskier ideas - that's not something I would have expected to hear, but it makes a lot of sense as a creative benefit.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's it! Thanks so much for chatting.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about AI as a creative cheerleader, the brainstorming dynamic, and your thoughts on the future paradigm shifts have been incredibly valuable. It's clear you've found a really thoughtful balance in how you integrate AI into your work while maintaining your creative agency.

Your perspectives will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Thanks again, and best of luck with your music projects!
