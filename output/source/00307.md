Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

If you're ready, I'd love to start by hearing about how AI fits into your typical workday. What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a Project Manager and Agile Lead for a fintech company doing banking software implementations. I'm currently working with First Bank of Puerto Rico doing an upgrade to their OAO, BAO, Banker, and Teller systems.
I use AI in several different ways. I use it to summarize meetings, create Meeting minutes, keep track of tasks, and summarize long email threads that I get added to, to name a few off the top of my head.

AI: That sounds like you're managing some complex banking system implementations. Tell me more about how you use AI to summarize those long email threads - what does that process typically look like for you?

User: My company has integrated CoPilot 365 into Microsoft tools like Teams and Outlook. For emails and Teams threads, there's now a sidepanel that I can open and chat with an AI about the topic at hand. Summarizing threads and email chains is as easy as opening the side-panel and asking "summarize the main points and current open actions items and unanswered questions. Who needs to respond at this point?"

AI: That integration sounds really seamless. When you get that summary back from the AI, what do you typically do with that information? Do you act on it directly, or do you find yourself double-checking certain parts before moving forward?

User: I will often double check, but it has references. For each main point, it usually focuses on a certain person, what they said, etc. And there's a reference number that I can click that it'll take me to where in the conversation it's referencing. So I usually double check before I act on the information, but it's easy to see exactly what it's talking about.

AI: That reference feature sounds really helpful for verification. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your project management role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Since it's integrated across Microsoft office products, it usually offers to help when I open Excel/powerpoint/etc. I always dismiss those. I don't trust it to do formulas for me in Excel - if I have a specific question I've asked AI in the past, but generally google does well enough for me to find what I need. And powerpoint, I haven't tried AI integration yet.

AI: What is it about Excel formulas specifically that makes you prefer to handle those yourself or turn to Google instead of the AI assistant?

User: For one, I love excel formulas. I find it really satisfying to get an excellent formula right. I've also been doing it for so long that it's just as quick for me to do it myself than to describe to an AI what I want done, and then to double check it's done it correctly.

AI: That personal satisfaction you get from crafting Excel formulas is really interesting. When you do use AI for work tasks like summarizing meetings or email threads, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to ask it to handle something completely and then review the results?

User: For summarizing, I don't really collaborate much with it. I ask for a summary, I review what it gives me, I sometimes review the references but not always, and then I move on. Sometimes I ask followup questions for something specific that I'd like to delve deeper into, but not always needed.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at your company using these tools similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: I only know of one other person using AI in my work, though I'm sure others are doing so quietly. A Co-manager with me also uses AI - copilot integration. She uses it to search emails and even try to interact with JIRA for her. I don't think JIRA is very successful - I've tried it before. It can help with JQL queries, but that's about it.
But she's the one that made me push to get the CoPilot integration, because when I miss a meeting, it can do a quick recap instead of me having to listen to the whole meeting. Once I knew it could do that, I needed it to save a ton of time.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I often get double-booked in meetings. The ability to get a recap of what has happened already in the meeting when I join late is amazing. That made it feel like a game-changer. As well as meeting recaps where I wasn't able to attend at all, but I can see what conclusions the team came to, and what the followup action items were that came out of the meeting, so I could follow up with team members on next steps.

AI: That sounds incredibly valuable for staying connected with your team's progress. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I've thought about it, but at least for now, my job is too complex, too many moving parts for AI to replace me. I think it's not about AI replacing people - I do, however, think that Managers who do my job without working with AI will be replaced by managers who DO work with AI, since we are going to be a lot more thorough and able to do more work and keep track of more than people who don't utilize AI.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it'll be able to take over more of the little things, but mainly do better at what it does now. I look forward to having to review behind AI less. When I can trust what it says without having to research behind it, it'll save a lot of time and headache. I need it to never hallucinate and always be truthful, especially when it doesn't know something or it's confused.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI users will have an advantage over non-users in management roles, and your practical approach to verification through those reference features.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's great. Thanks for the questions. This was cool.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for meeting recaps, email summarization, and how the reference features help with verification will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate how candid you were about both the areas where AI works well for you and where you prefer to maintain control. Take care!
