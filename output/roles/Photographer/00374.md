Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a photographer. I use generative AI in LightRoom and PhotoShop all day long. Administratively, I use it to draft client emails, summarize long back and forth conversations with clients to pluck out all the important details, and I'm starting to use it for contract generation.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across both the creative and business sides of your photography work. 

When you're using generative AI in Lightroom and Photoshop, what specific things are you having it do? Walk me through what that looks like in practice.

User: Often it's for small things like removing a trashcan, a random person in the background, or a phone from someone's pocket. I also use it to extend backgrounds. For instance, I will take a close up photo of a couple at a long focal length (say 200mm). In that photo the couple will be in focus and the background will be beautifully bokeh. But there won't be a lot of background around them because I already have to get so far back to shoot at that length. So I will use AI to generatively expand the background for a more pleasing composition. That's just one example - I use it for hundreds of other generative things.

AI: That's a really detailed example - I can picture exactly what you mean about extending that bokeh background around the couple. 

When you're doing these generative tasks, are there certain types of edits or creative decisions that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: The only time I would not use AI is if I could do it faster myself. And that's rare. Sometimes I might use the clone stamp tool instead of AI generative fill if what I'm fixing is easy. But more often generative AI is faster than me.

AI: So it sounds like speed and efficiency are your main deciding factors. 

When you are using AI for these tasks - whether it's the photo editing or the administrative work like drafting emails - how do you typically work with it? Are you going back and forth, refining things together, or do you tend to give it a task and let it handle it completely?

User: Speed and efficiency are factors. But not necessarily the deciding factor. A lot of the generative AI I use in PhotoShop I could not do at all without AI. It has opened up a lot of new creative opportunities. I do typically go back and forth with AI refining things.

AI: That's a really important distinction - so AI isn't just making your existing work faster, it's actually enabling creative possibilities that weren't there before.

When you say you go back and forth refining things, what does that process look like? Can you walk me through a specific example of how you and the AI work together on something?

User: Here's an administrative example - today I have to create a plan for a photoshoot. I gave AI the date and general area of town my clients wanted. I had it suggest locations and write a short blurb about each location to share with my clients so they could ultimately make the best decision. I then had it create the schedule based on the best lighting for that area.

AI: That's a great example of the back-and-forth process. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other photographers you know using it similarly, or are you finding your own path with it?

User: I don't talk about AI that often with my colleagues. Photographers tend to be afraid of AI because they worry it will take their jobs. It's harder to convince them that there are ways to use AI to improve their work not replace it.

AI: That's really interesting - there's clearly some tension in your field around AI adoption. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have a wedding coming up in a few weeks and I have emailed with the clients hundreds of times over the last year. I just used AI to summarize all of our emails so that I didn't miss or misunderstand any important details. That was such a time saver! As for frustrated - I don't understand why generative AI can't do a better job removing glare from glasses. It seems like an easy enough task but every time I try, AI decides to create entirely different eyes instead of just removing the glare.

AI: Ha! That glasses glare issue sounds really frustrating - it's interesting how AI can handle some complex tasks brilliantly but then struggle with what seems like it should be straightforward.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm really good at my job. I don't mean to brag - but it's true. I don't feel worried that AI will be able to replicate the soul I put into my work or the love and care I show to my clients. Instead, it helps me be a better photographer and business owner.

AI: That confidence in the unique value you bring really comes through. It sounds like you see AI as enhancing rather than threatening your core strengths.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope that the AI Adobe uses will just become better (i.e. remove glare on glasses in one click!). Administratively, I see myself using it more and more.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has opened up new creative possibilities rather than just speeding up existing work, and your confidence that it enhances rather than replaces the unique value you bring to your photography.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI both creatively and administratively as a photographer - and especially how you've embraced it while your colleagues remain hesitant - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
