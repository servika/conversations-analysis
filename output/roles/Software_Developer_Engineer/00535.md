Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No question lets start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use AI to brush up on domain knowledge of what I'm working on. It also helps me come up with new ideas and approaches to idea I don't think of before. This allows me to have a conversation with the AI to continue the thinking into something that can be implemented.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a thinking partner to expand your knowledge and explore new directions. 

Can you walk me through what one of these conversations with AI typically looks like when you're developing an idea into something implementable?

User: i first ask the AI if it knows about the topic I'm looking for. Then I provide context based on my task to make sure the AI knows whats going on. Then I start asking questions from different directions of thinking to pick out information I need.

AI: That's a methodical approach - starting with knowledge verification, then setting context, and exploring from multiple angles. 

When you say you ask questions "from different directions of thinking," what does that look like in practice? Can you give me an example of how you might approach a topic from these different angles?

User: Lets say I'm talking about a coding bug I'm having in my project. I give the AI my possible thinking of where the bug is and see if the AI can agree. Then if AI comes with a new thinking, I branch into more ideas for the AI to work with

AI:

User: hello?

AI: I'm here! Thanks for that example - it's helpful to understand how you use that branching approach with coding bugs.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle tasks that requires very specific company related knowledge so that information isn't leaked. While AI can solve the problem there is risk of privacy

AI: That makes a lot of sense - protecting company-specific information is definitely a key consideration.

Beyond privacy concerns, are there other types of tasks where you choose to work independently rather than involve AI, even when privacy isn't an issue?

User: If privacy isn't a concern, I would prefer AI to give me the support I need.

AI: That's really helpful to understand - privacy is your primary consideration for when to work independently.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I like to work through the problem with AI. I don't trust the work AI puts out independently.

AI: That's a clear preference for collaboration over delegation. 

What is it about AI working independently that makes you feel you can't trust the output? What concerns you most about that approach?

User: AI is not a human and can easily make mistakes. If they do make a mistake, I'll be the one taking all the blame. Afterall, AI is a tool not a human.

AI: That accountability aspect really stands out - you're ultimately responsible for the work that goes out with your name on it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My company promotes AI and is in the AI space. As a result, they want me to integrate AI into my work for max efficiency.  As a result, I'm accustomed to AI.

AI: Interesting - so you're in an environment that actively encourages AI adoption. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time that using AI made me feel satisfied is when it find the bug I've been trying to solve for a long time. AI gave me a hint at the bug and lead me to the answer

AI: That must have been a great moment of breakthrough! It sounds like the AI pointed you in the right direction rather than just giving you the complete solution.

What made that interaction particularly effective - was it something about how you framed the problem, or how the AI responded, or something else about that collaboration?

User: Probably how I framed the question. Sometimes an extra word or two can make the conversation so different for the AI to catch.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about how subtle changes in phrasing can dramatically shift the AI's understanding and response.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think being creative and understanding design is more important than coding with AI taking over.

AI: That's a thoughtful shift in focus - emphasizing creativity and design understanding as the more enduring human skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think AI will be a tool that'll always be by my side. A dual partner at my fingertips.

AI: That's a nice way to put it - AI as a constant companion and collaborator.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how framing questions can make such a difference in the quality of AI responses, and your view of AI as an accountability partner where you remain responsible for the final output.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative approach, the importance of question framing, and how you balance trust with accountability will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!

User: you too

AI: Thank you! Take care.

User: do i close this page now

AI: Yes, you can close this page now - we've completed the interview. Thanks again for participating!
