Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as the managing director for a virtual tutoring company. My job includes doing sales calls with clients, scheduling students, doing coordination for new students, etc. I use AI in a lot of my administrative tasks like varying the sales follow-up phrasing (before I just used Google templates for this, but I like the variation I can get from AI), and I often use it to help me brainstorm diplomatic responses to angry parents, so I will get it to draft a message for me based on the circumstances and messages I received from parents.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like AI is helping you with some of the more nuanced communication aspects of your role - both in sales and in those potentially tricky parent interactions.

When you're dealing with those angry parent situations, can you walk me through how you typically work with AI? Do you give it the full context of what happened, or how do you approach getting that diplomatic response drafted?

User: Often what I'll do is start off with a short summary of 2-3 sentences of what happened. Then I will give it the most recent email or message I got from the parent about the situation. I will tell it what my goals are for the communication and ask it to give me a few options for a response, which I then edit to suit my purposes.

AI: That's a really clear process. I'm curious - when you get those draft options back from AI, what kinds of edits do you typically find yourself making? What is it about your own voice or approach that you need to adjust?

User: Usually I edit it to better match my own voice. A lot of these conversations are very delicate and emotions can run high from the parents, so an overly formal response can be offputting. I often will take the ideas the AI has given me and make them sound a bit less formal and more like they are coming from me, adding more empathetic phrases or different options for action for the parent that the AI might not know about (like I will often ask the parent to call me to conference with the tutor, or recommend they sign up for a different test date, which aren't things the AI has background context on)

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using the AI as a starting point for the structure and diplomatic tone, but then layering in your personal touch and company-specific knowledge.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I always prefer to handle billing and invoicing myself. Even though AI could probably handle making a summary of charges for a student for the semester, I always like to add those up myself so I know exactly where the numbers are coming from and can add client-specific info. I just don't trust the models to handle billing since it's pretty high-stakes. Also, I forgot to mention one crucial way I use AI in my job, can I tell you about that now?

AI: Absolutely! I'd love to hear about that other way you use AI - please go ahead and tell me about it.

User: One of the most helpful uses is drafting interview questions for when I'm hiring tutors. I often struggle to think of constructive questions to ask, and using AI to brainstorm based on the role and the tutor resume has led me to have more dynamic and interesting interviews!

AI: That's a great example! It sounds like AI is helping you think through what to explore with candidates that you might not have considered on your own.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared - whether it's the parent communications, the interview questions, or the sales follow-ups - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I definitely am more likely to collaborate. I can't think of any instances where I purely delegate a task to AI.

AI: That's interesting - you seem to consistently use AI as a collaborative partner rather than handing things off completely. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at your company approach AI similarly, or have you developed your own style?

User: I would say I've developed my own style. My boss actually uses it a lot more than I do, he is very gung-ho about AI. He will often use it to draft emails to students/parents and send them as-is without editing. I think it's a bit of a generation gap; he's a bit older and less tech-competent, and what I read as seeming a bit artificial in tone he thinks is fine. But he is very pro-AI and encourages me to use it whenever possible, even though we use it in different ways

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - it sounds like you have the freedom to use AI but with very different approaches. Your boss being more willing to send AI-generated content as-is while you prefer to edit for authenticity really highlights those different comfort levels.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The most recent time I used this was to draft a response to a negative google review where the parent made false claims about our services and the way things happened. Using AI, I was able to draft a great, concise response which didn't come off as too defensive or apologetic while incorporating all the facts. It was a really satisfying interaction and it was helpful to have a third party helping me write without all of the emotions and anxiety I had wrapped up in the situation that had me wanting to be more defensive. In short, it helped me stay professional in response to a tough situation.

AI: That's a really powerful example - using AI to help you step back from the emotional intensity and craft a response that was professional and factual. It sounds like the AI helped you access a more objective perspective when your own emotions were running high.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Honestly, it's not something I consider much. While there are parts of my job that could be automated like routine admin tasks, the human element of doing sales is really hard to replicate. I don't think an AI could ever convince a client to work with us over the phone like I do and bring in that human connection that leads a client to trust us working with their kid.

AI: That confidence in the uniquely human aspects of your role makes sense, especially given how much your work involves building trust with families around their children.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or in new ways as the technology develops?

User: I definitely see myself using it in new ways in the future. I would love to be able to fully delegate routine administrative tasks rather than needing my input as much. I would also love to see a tool that allows for coordination across calendars between different students and tutors, or even the developmnet of a fully AI-based tutor management software- we still haven't found one we like that is worth the cost! I also look forward to the possibility of having AI improve the coding on our outdated website if I ever learn how to do this, as well as potentially have it work on giving me feedback on my sales calls transcripts. I've done this before but right now its feedback isn't super helpful, but I'm hopeful that will change as models get stronger.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as that objective third party to help you navigate emotionally charged situations - that's such a nuanced way to think about collaboration with AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between AI assistance and maintaining your own voice, especially in those delicate parent communications, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were about describing your collaborative approach versus your boss's more hands-off style - those kinds of real-world differences in how people integrate AI are exactly what we're hoping to understand better.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your tutoring company!
