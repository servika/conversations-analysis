Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Great.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use it formally in my work. I am a librarian so we have our own database system we work with. However, I use it informally for both book recommendations and as a way of troubleshooting for library patrons as we do a lot of unofficial tech support for the community. I also occasionally use it if I'm putting together some documentation but I only do that very occasionally for specialised programs.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become a helpful resource even when it's not part of your official toolkit. 

When you're doing that unofficial tech support for community members, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How does AI help you troubleshoot their issues?

User: So if someone comes up to the front desk and is having trouble formatting a document or downloading an app on their phone (even if the app isn't library related we'll attempt to help them), I used to give the advice of telling them to articulate their problem to google specifically. Now I might redirect them to ChatGPT and tell them to work it through there. Depending on the patrons age and computer literacy I might actually sit with them and show them through the chat either from my desktop computer or just give them some hints that they can walk away with. I like to give them the tools to be self guided so they can figure out future problems themselves but sometimes that is beyond some peoples technical abilities.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - teaching people to fish rather than just solving the problem for them. 

I'm curious about your decision-making process there. When a patron comes to you with a tech issue, how do you decide whether to guide them to use ChatGPT versus handling it through more traditional methods like Google searches or your own troubleshooting?

User: I believe that some of our job is teaching people to use appropriate resources so I try and teach them pretty patiently. Obviously sometimes you are just getting them to upload their document to our printing system or something very easy and that I do through having done it plenty of times before. But if it is more than a really simple press there direction, I really want to show them how to resolve it. Generative AI is particularly good for this, even if people aren't that confident with technology because you can keep going back and telling it why specifically something isn't working and it will keep making suggestions and make them detailed enough for a less tech capable audience.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the conversational nature of AI seems particularly well-suited for people who might struggle with the trial-and-error approach of traditional search.

You mentioned you're selective about when to use this approach versus handling things yourself. Are there certain types of tech problems or certain patrons where you prefer to stick with your own expertise rather than introducing AI into the mix?

User: Mainly with our printing system which is a genuine pain in the arse, I know the tricks and tips and also know that often this is a one off customer that will never come back into the library again (we are in a high visitor/tourist area) so I am happy to just direct them over their shoulder on their smartphone. So then I'll direct them but for more general enquires I really think that them being able to use generative AI is actually a life skill so I'm happy to spend a bit of extra time introducing them to the process. Also if you are asking a library assistant for help you are often not that technological confident and I really like to be patient but also teach them ways of being able to problem solve.

AI: It sounds like you're making strategic decisions about when to prioritize efficiency versus education based on the person and situation. 

When you do introduce patrons to generative AI as a problem-solving tool, what kinds of reactions do you typically see? How do people respond to this new approach?

User: There are definitely times where people feel like you are fobbing them off. With those cases sometimes I'll work through the problem with them on my desktop computer so they can see that it isn't a question of me trying to save time, instead this is the way that I genuinely work through tech issues. I also might tell them that this is what I do personally even as someone with pretty decent tech skills. People mainly find it helpful and actually really like being able to ask the machine rather than a person, most people are a little bit embarrassed by technical problems. Sometimes you do come across someone who is very resistant but they are often just patrons that are very difficult anyway.

AI: That's really insightful - the idea that people might actually prefer asking the machine rather than a person because it removes some of that embarrassment factor.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Obviously there are times when you know you can give them the answer in ten seconds so you might just do that then but otherwise it is something that I like to work through with someone just because I know how helpful the process is.

AI: That makes sense for patron interactions. I'm wondering more broadly about your own work tasks - when you're doing things like writing documentation for specialized programs or getting book recommendations, are there aspects of those tasks where you think "I'd rather handle this part myself" even if AI could assist?

User: Totally. I write all my own emails and do genuinely prefer to do most of my writing myself. I also rely a lot on my own knowledge of the library collection when making recommendations. This is mainly because we are a regional library with a limited collection so rather than asking the AI to make recommendations and getting back recommendations that we might not have in the collection it is easier just to use my own knowledge. I mainly use it for very specific things that I might not have knowledge about or something where I know that generative AI will be very good in eg. Like I help choose our quick reads which is books we buy in multiples and have available for a week loan. I like to check what is happening in the book zeitgeist so I know what might have broad appeal. There is nothing worse than buying four copies of a book that no-one wants to read. I'm really good at book recommendations so this a very specific thing I do at our library branch.

AI: That's a perfect example of playing to both your strengths and AI's strengths - you know your collection intimately, but AI can give you that broader pulse on what's trending. 

When you do use AI for checking the book zeitgeist, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it to refine what you're looking for, or do you tend to ask it for information and then take that away to make your own decisions?

User: Luckily I'm a fast touch typist. So I can easily have a few windows open on my desktop when I'm dealing with a patron, so I can have ChatGPT open as well as our database and be flicking between the two. I might ask for a recommendation based on a recently enjoyed book and then open up our system to see if we have the author recommended. Other people who I work with can't seem to navigate the system as fast which makes this process harder. I'm probably more likely to use generative AI just because of my familiarity with the tools.

AI: That's a great point about technical fluency making AI more useful as a tool. It sounds like your comfort with juggling multiple systems simultaneously really enables that collaborative approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find others are embracing it similarly, or are there different approaches across your library?

User: I am one of the most technical people on the team so I'm more likely to influence others and if people see something is working for me they might pick up my workflow. A lot of workflow is learnt through observation.

AI: That makes sense - you're kind of setting the example for how AI can fit into library work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I love the moment when introduce it to someone who will find it genuinely helpful. I really believe that generative AI is a great tool for most individuals and I like that bit of sharing something that I think is helpful.

AI: That satisfaction in helping someone discover a useful tool really comes through. It sounds like there's something meaningful for you in that moment of connection and empowerment.

On the flip side, have there been moments when using AI has been frustrating for you? Times when it didn't work as expected or created more complications?

User: Sometimes you'll find someone resistant philosophically and they take it as you trying to fob them off or you can get lost in a loop of someones tech problem being so specific that they can't get an answer that satisfies them.

AI: Those philosophical resistance moments sound particularly challenging - when someone interprets your genuine attempt to help as avoidance.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Absolutely. I love good tech but ever since I realised how good language models could be I have been worried about social effects with corporations and organisations moving away from human labor. I not worried so much about my own job in the short term but more about the labor market generally and think that we could be for a time of social change.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - distinguishing between personal job security and broader societal impacts. It sounds like you're optimistic about AI as a tool while being realistic about potential economic disruptions.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different tasks as time goes on?

User: I'd like to actually be able to teach people more generally about generative AI. I do think it can be an amazing tool for individuals and would like to see our organisation do more community outreach.

AI: That vision of expanding into more formal education around AI tools really aligns with your library's community mission. It sounds like you see potential to scale up what you're already doing informally.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a teaching tool for digital literacy and your awareness of both its individual benefits and broader societal implications.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a bridge to help people develop problem-solving skills, and your thoughtful approach to balancing efficiency with education, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Take care.
