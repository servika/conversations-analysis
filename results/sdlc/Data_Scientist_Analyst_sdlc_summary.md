## Representative Examples

### Example 1: Interview 00578

**SDLC Score**: 15

**Categories**: development, testing, maintenance, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I work on healthcare databases and data applications to help our data scientists interface with healthcare data for research and development purposes."

2. "I don't necessarily use Cursor for more complex tasks. My decision to use Cursor is always about the context window. Do I think having the entire codebase in context will be helpful? If not, i'll just copy and paste a snippet into ChatGPT. Especially with large codebases I am not familiar with, I lo..."

### Example 2: Interview 00787

**SDLC Score**: 15

**Categories**: development, testing, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Sure! I usually use AI when I'm working with code-heavy projects, or if I'm doing an analysis of some sort. Typically, during a busy period -- say I'm assigned to 2-3 projects for the week, I might see myself using AI to help generate code while I'm working on these projects to help me save time. I'..."

2. "I would say a mixture of both! I explain the context and situation that I'm working with, and describe what needs to be done. Things like "I have a dataframe with these columns, and I want to make sure that for each unique ID of the column, the number of times they have this column as "1" should be ..."

### Example 3: Interview 00448

**SDLC Score**: 12

**Categories**: development, testing, maintenance, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I'm a data analyst at SUEZ and I use AI for a variety of things daily. Most common is when I'm coding for Excel , VBA , Power Query M or Dax. It saves a lot of time because it speeds up repetitive / tedious coding a ton. But I use it for other tasks as well. I have to prepare slide decks for meeting..."

2. "Yes , I often tell it to write the entire code for a certain task. Other times, I'll provide it with some code I already have and then ask AI to modify it to do something additional or just to optimise it. Often for more complex tasks, AI will struggle to code it so I will manually walk through it s..."

### Example 4: Interview 01097

**SDLC Score**: 12

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I like to use AI as a starting point for my research, but I still like to conduct the thorough research myself, often I'll notice AI missed some things, or some of the ideas it gives me aren't actually viable, or it hallucinated an idea all together, so I like to do the in-depth part of this task my..."

2. "it's usually a very collaborative process, where I copy and paste a lot from different sources into the AI to ask it questions."

### Example 5: Interview 00624

**SDLC Score**: 11

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "so I'm a data analyst at a big tech company, and I do quality auditing and analytics for a team of in-house data labelers. The quality is important because they're doing things like creating golden and benchmark datasets for various things. This was my first data analytics job (I was promoted intern..."

2. "mainly through repetition, which is how most people learn I guess. I ask it how to do something in a certain formula, it looks like total gobbledygook (excel formulas are atrociously onerous as someone used to python), it walks me through what the formula means, and then after a certain amount of re..."
