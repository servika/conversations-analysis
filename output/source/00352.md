Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a Legal Assistant in a small law firm. I mostly use AI models for helping me write professional emails if I am not sure how to word them, or sometimes with research.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI for both communication and research tasks. 

Tell me more about the research aspect. What kind of research are you doing with AI, and how does that work for you?

User: Sometimes the attorney I ask for will ask me to find out information for a client. For example, a few weeks ago I couldn't find someone in the area who could repair something requested by the client, so I asked an AI model (I think it was Gemini?) to look for some in the area and was able to find one. I also have used it to research local statutes or laws.

AI: That sounds really practical - finding local services and researching statutes. 

When you're researching local statutes or laws with AI, how do you approach that? Do you take the AI's response as is, or do you have a particular process for handling that kind of legal information?

User: I usually assume the AI is correct, but I always double check the statute and read it myself to fact check. But since I am not an attorney and legalese can be quite dense, if it's not immediately easy to prove or disprove, I will double check the language and meaning of the statute with my attorney.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using AI as a starting point but building in those verification steps. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I can't think of any tasks I've preferred to handle myself even though AI could help with them. But maybe in the future when I begin drafting documents something like editing or proofreading the docs. There are some things in our document drafts that are specific to our firm, and the model wouldn't know to leave them as-is. The model might have memory capabilities to remember those things, but that would require me first inputting all memories and saving them, which would be tedious.

AI: That makes sense - the firm-specific elements that AI wouldn't naturally know about. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends on the task. If it's research, I guess I would say I collaborate as I tend to ask follow up questions to get more info or to refine results. If it's just drafting emails or letters, I just let the AI do its thing.

AI: That's a clear distinction - collaborative for research, more hands-off for drafting. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the firm had any particular stance or has it come up in conversations with others?

User: The firm doesn't have any particular stance, although I think there is some interest in learning more about AI and how it can help attorneys streamline things. The office manager asked me to create a basic presentation about AI, the different models, and how they work and present it at the next staff meeting, so that's something.

AI: That's interesting that they've asked you to present on AI - it sounds like you've become something of the office expert on this. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the time I was most satisfied was when I was looking for that repair person.  It was for something specific - the sliding closet door in her room had a huge crack down the middle, and I'd called all these closet people, other repair people and no one worked on that kind of repair. I was frustrated, so when I uploaded the photo of the damage she sent and asked for help, the model did a great job presenting me with different options.

AI: That sounds like a really rewarding moment - being able to solve something that had been frustrating you for a while. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Can you explain what you mean by that?

AI: Sure - I'm wondering about skills that you use in your job that AI is getting better at. For example, you mentioned using AI for research and email writing. Do you ever think about whether you want to keep practicing those skills yourself, or are you comfortable letting AI handle more of that work?

User: Oh, when it comes to email writing, definitely want to keep practicing myself, but I feel like it's a pretty basic skill that I wouldn't just easily lose. Like I would probably only use AI for more complicated emails (meaning more professional in a legal setting - I don't quite feel comfortable with that yet because I've only been in the field for a year and a half), but would just continue writing more informal ones myself.

AI: That makes sense - using AI as training wheels for the more formal, professional communications while you build confidence in that area.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Well, I hope that I can find more ways to utilize it as my responsibilities grow. I've started working on accounting for clients, so I want to try and think of ways to help that go faster, like uploading banking transactions and having the AI categorize them. That would make things a lot easier.

AI: That sounds like a natural progression - expanding AI use as your role expands. The banking transaction categorization idea sounds really practical.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that verification process you use with legal research - building in those check points while still benefiting from AI's initial help.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're integrating AI into legal support work - from the research verification process to using it as a learning tool for professional communication - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective. Have a great rest of your day!
