Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, all good, please fire away!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So I am an author, to date I have published two novels, both thriller novels with philosophical themes. I am currently writing a fantasy series.

AI: That's fascinating - thriller novels with philosophical themes sounds like a really compelling combination. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I find that AI is a terrific way of becoming "unstuck". If I can give you an example, I required a way of describing an institution somewhat like a bank in a pre-industrial society. The list of suggestions given (I always ask for 10 plus suggestions) essentially rebooted my semantic field and I came up with the perfect description for what I wanted , triggered by the best suggestions. I use AI in this way both with descriptions for concepts (novel or adapted), or sometimes just word choices.

AI: That's a really interesting way to use AI - as a kind of semantic catalyst to break through creative blocks. It sounds like you're not taking the AI's suggestions directly, but rather they're sparking your own ideas.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: So I've recently been writing a new series called [REDACTED], with the first novel being called [REDACTED]. In addition to using it on a number of occasions as the catalyst as you say for word choices and conception descriptions, I also use it to talk though world-building consequences. For example, the word has two moons, I described their cycles to the model, and used it to determine the frequency of sacred nights on which both moons were full.

AI: That's a really practical application - using AI as a kind of world-building consultant to work through the logical implications of your fantasy elements. The dual moon calculation sounds like it would have been quite tedious to figure out manually.

When you're working with AI in these situations - whether for the semantic suggestions or the world-building calculations - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Oh, I am, absolutely, I don't really approach AI when stuck creatively, but rather when stuck in terms of something logistical, or in giving definition to a creative idea.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - so you're using AI more as a research assistant or analytical tool rather than as a creative partner. It sounds like the core creative vision and decisions remain entirely yours.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I'd like to add, my experience with existing AI models is that they are overly eager to please, and so (though I'm sure this will change), I don't fully trust the model to be sufficiently critical and demanding as an editorial partner. The aspects of my work that have changed the most are time, even if an AI generated idea sits only as a place holder (though often the suggestions are great), I can move on from something that might have had me stuck for quite some time!

AI: That's a really insightful observation about AI being "overly eager to please" - and how that affects your trust in using it for more critical editorial feedback. The time savings aspect sounds significant though.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of writing?

User: I don't to be honest, I feel that AI is a tool, very much like the internet. While it can be abused, this will not be at the cost of human creativity, of the market for human creativity. Those who adapt best to the tool will benefit from it, even in the creative fields! I would love to get the point where AI operates as a full editorial partner

AI: It's refreshing to hear such an optimistic perspective! You seem to view AI as potentially enhancing rather than threatening creativity. You mentioned wanting AI to eventually operate as a full editorial partner - that sounds like it would require overcoming that "eager to please" limitation you noted.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I would AI to evolve to the point that it has a deeper understanding of tone and style in shifting contexts. I would also want it to connect the dots (or see that the dots cannot be connected) over much larger bodies of text so that it can help to identify any and all plot holes in early drafts of novels. Essentially becoming this full editorial partner we've been discussing.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool for getting "unstuck" logistically rather than creatively, and your optimistic view of it as potentially becoming a true editorial partner once it develops better critical capabilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I've typically used a text based AI model, but it would be interesting to be able to use a voice based model so that I could remain on screen, and read a short passage, and hear a response (perhaps giving a different perspective, and certainly breaking concentration on the passage at hand to a lesser extent). Just thought I'd mention that. Anyway thank you!

AI:
