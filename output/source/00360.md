Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, please continue with the questions.

AI: Perfect, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically I use AI to help me rewrite emails before I send them. I use the AI to help me make sure I'm not over explaining a topic, providing unnecessary details, or using the wrong tone. Sometimes I will also send in a few different loan option scenarios and ask for the AI to provide pros and cons of each, or select which one is the best option.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI both for communication refinement and for analytical decision-making with those loan scenarios.

When you're working on those loan option scenarios, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you present the information to the AI and what kind of analysis are you looking for?

User: So typically, I will provide a few different pricing scenarios. For example, one option might be interest only to allow for a higher loan amount with a 3 year pre-payment penalty, while another option might provide a fixed rate, but with a slightly lower loan amount or a longer pre-payment penalty. I'm typically looking for what saves the borrower the most amount of money given their circumstances, so it's also kind of brainstorming in a way. 

I usually present the data like this: 
Product 1: 7.125% interest rate, 30 year fixed $172,500 loan amount, 3-2-1% prepayment penalty, P&I $1,162.16, cash out amount $14,000
Product 2: 7.250% 40 yr fixed/10 Yr Io $172,500 loan amount, 3-2-1% prepayment penalty, Interest only payment $1,042, rough cash out $11,500
Product 3: 7.000% interest rate, 30 year fixed $170,000 loan amount, 3-2-1% prepayment penalty, P&I $1,131.02, rough cash out $10,500


And then I would ask a question, something like this: 

Which option provides a good balance between getting the most cash out possible while keeping a lower monthly payment?

AI: That's a fascinating use case - you're essentially using AI as a financial analysis partner to help optimize outcomes for your borrowers. 

I'm curious about your decision-making process here. Are there certain aspects of this loan analysis that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes you want to keep those parts under your own control?

User: The final judgement always ends up in my hands, of course, and I make sure to verify that the answer provided  by the AI makes accurate assumptions about monthly payments, interest rates, etc. This just helps me get started on how I would like to move forward with a client, because sometimes the option that technically saves them the most money may not be the best fit for their situation. If the AI tool were more specifically catered to loan analysis and comparisons, I would likely be more trusting of its results.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're maintaining that final judgment while using AI as a starting point for your analysis.

When you're working through these loan scenarios with AI, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it, refining the analysis together, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it provide a complete recommendation that you then evaluate?

User: I typically try to provide the full scenario up front, and any back and forth usually involves me providing additional product options to consider. Other back and forth involves verifying or correcting any inconsistencies in the response the AI provided.

AI: That's helpful - so you're mostly delegating the initial analysis but staying engaged to add options and verify accuracy.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your field using it similarly, or have you developed this approach on your own?

User: The brokerage I work for is rather small, just me and the company owner. The owner of the company supports the use of AI to help refine our work. He mostly uses it to refine emails, rather than asking for assistance with analysis. 

One other thing I use it for that I didn't mention previously is that if I need to have a difficult conversation with a client or one that I am stressed about, I will ask for guidance on how to approach it.  For example, a client is in a difficult financial situation and needs cash-out, but the options I have to provide jeopardize their monthly cash flow. My own bias or opinions might affect how I present the loan options, which I should not do because if they qualify for the loan, I shouldn't necessarily steer them away from the options available to them, but rather present it and let them come to their own conclusion. Sometimes it's hard for me to separate my own opinion or feelings, and AI helps me to rein that in and present it in the best way possible, but still also communicate my recommendations in a professional way.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI to help maintain professional objectivity in emotionally challenging situations. It sounds like you've found it particularly valuable for navigating that balance between your professional responsibility and your personal concern for clients.

Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The example situation that I mentioned is actually a real situation that I needed help with. AI helped me to navigate that conversation in the best way possible, so I was happy with the outcome. I made sure my client knew that I cared about the outcome of them receiving this loan while also still presenting them the  best options I had available at the time. It was a complex scenario involving multiple rental properties, some of which were already struggling with negative cash flow. I tried to present options that both helped alleviate some of the cash-flow issues and provided a portion of the cash-out the client was looking for. 

One of the only things that frustrates me is that I can't directly copy and paste from a spreadsheet to analyze different options because the copied entry comes out like this:

AI: That spreadsheet formatting issue sounds genuinely frustrating when you're trying to work efficiently with detailed financial data. It's interesting how that technical limitation creates friction in an otherwise helpful workflow.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do have to maintain all of my current skills because I have obligations and requirements placed on me by licensing authorities. While AI can be a useful tool, it doesn't replace my human judgment on ethics and other areas important to compliance and law. So while it can make my work faster and easier, I still have to very carefully review everything to make sure I am compliant for my licensing.

AI: That's a really important point about the regulatory and ethical responsibilities that can't be delegated. It sounds like your licensing requirements actually reinforce the collaborative approach you've developed with AI.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It would be nice to have tools that are more refined for what I do. I'd like to see AI integrated into pricing engines to ensure that the pricing sheets I'm receiving from lenders are up to date, accurate, and a good fit for my scenario. This could make a lot of what I do faster and more efficient. AI can also help provide very clear explanations of different product options, help borrowers learn and understand more of what they are being offered, and just lead to overall improvement in communication in the industry.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI to maintain professional objectivity in challenging client situations, and how you've found ways to leverage it while still maintaining the critical oversight your licensing requires.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that is all.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. The way you've described balancing AI assistance with professional judgment and regulatory compliance really illustrates how thoughtfully people are integrating these tools into specialized work environments.

I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
