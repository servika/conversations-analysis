Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that all sounds good to me and I dont have any questions at the moment but am I able to ask you clarifying questions during our interview?

AI: Absolutely! Please feel free to ask clarifying questions anytime during our conversation. That kind of back-and-forth actually makes for a much better interview - if something I ask isn't clear or you want to understand what I'm looking for, just let me know.

Alright, let's dive in. Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: During my workday, I have AI extension tools (ie. Grammarly) that are saved on my web browser that are enabled to assist me with the emails and correspondence I send internally at my company or externally with our customers. Grammarly's built-in AI always helps me fine tune my writing skills and brainstorm the most concise and clear methods to how I write at work. My google workspace account also comes equipped with Gemini AI, which I commonly use as a first level search engine (and to transcribe/take meeting notes) for the work projects that are very detail-oriented. Occasionally I will also ask ChatGBT for ideas or inspiration for miscellaneous work tasks as well such as finding an icebreaker/connection question to kick off a team work meeting.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of AI tools you're using. It sounds like you've integrated them into different parts of your workflow - from writing to research to meeting facilitation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The tasks I like to leave for myself to do are ones that will be most beneficial for my continued professional development in my current role and I typically do not rely on an AI tool to help me complete those projects unless I get stuck on something or could ask for any useful suggestions from the tool. The types of tasks I like to utilize without the use of AI are more project-management related because this is an area that I could use with more fine-tuning, practice with incorporating it into more of my workflows day-to-day. If I were to utilize AI to take care of all that work for me, I would lose the opportunity to make calculated mistakes and learn from them to ensure they dont repeat in the future. The kind of tasks I do utilize AI for are for more mundane, administrative in nature (ie. note-taking during work meetings, using Grammarly auto-spelling and conversation tone features to make my emails sound more professional) because I have a very intermediate knowledge in those areas and since there's not much more growth in those types of tasks, I will save myself time and let AI do most of the leg-work and I act as the final editor of whatever it produces because I always double check my work (even if half of it is being done by a supercomputer LLM model).

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using your professional development goals to guide where you draw those lines. It sounds like you're quite strategic about preserving learning opportunities for yourself.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: When I am utilizing AI for help during work,  I mostly collaborate with it while I am working throughout a work assignment because I am always striving to become more operationally efficient with how I handle my business operations workflows because I am the type of worker who likes to stay busy and also always open to learning more efficient ways to handle my daily workload so then I can be the best contributor to my team as much as possible. Again, the kind of tasks that are being AI spot-checked are ones revolving my communication (emails) and the other work-related ones that I know Im no good at (ie. taking detailed, organized meeting notes) I will leave for the AI tool to complete on it's own and then do a final review of it

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really effective - it's interesting how you differentiate between the tasks where you want that ongoing partnership versus the ones where you're comfortable with more of a delegation model.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My current company's primary product (SaaS education tool) is actively being upgraded to incorporate more AI-driven approaches to how it helps teachers with using best instructional practices to aid their students' education and because our company has embraced the challenge to use AI capabilities to improve on the product we currently have, our leadership team has been very vocal and encouraging more of my co-workers to utilize AI for their respective roles but in a smart, responsible way because we already understand that not everything AI produces is helpful and that having that final human-touch is what makes these LLMs so useful.

AI: That's fascinating that your company's product evolution is actually driving the internal culture around AI use. It sounds like there's real alignment between what you're building and how you're working.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The primary times I find frustrating with AI as I incorporate it into my daily work routine are the little annoying features that come built into the tool such as with my go to AI partner Grammarly because there are moments where I don't want it to auto-correct my conversations or change the tone, content of what Im writing but it still has a tendency to override my wishes every now and again. The tool also comes equipped with a particular button feature that for some reason is automatically displayed above the button/link for me to send a message and it's very irritating that the AI developers did not create a less intrusive way to having the tool work in concert with the communication/email platforms I use every day (Gmail, Front, Google Meet). A time I felt very satisfied with AI was the first time I discovered that the built-in Gemini feature with Google Meets and Zoom applications had the ability to take notes and transcribe work meetings because there was one particular IT security training session I wanted to reference and knew that I would probably need to have some notes jotted down in case I could not remember the operations to some feature. Luckily, Gemini-AI saved me because not only did it take down detailed notes of the training, the verbatim transcript of what was said during the virtual call was also available in the form of a Google Doc which was how I figured out how to troubleshoot an IT operation that I was running into difficulty with executing.

AI: Those are such specific examples - thank you for sharing those details. It really illustrates how the user experience design can make or break the AI integration, and how powerful it can be when it works seamlessly.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: That is a very good question and the skills I am trying to maintain in the work areas that I know AI could handle easily on it's own are the strategies that I am actively working on improving in terms of the best practices to become more efficient when managing and executing a long, complicated work project and often times, I mentally factor how much time I would save if I were to punt that task to an AI versus the amount of valuable knowledge I would lose out on if I were to rely on it's computational abilities. For most work projects, I strive to myself come up with a solution or approach to completing the task and use AI as a backup fail-safe option that I have in my back pocket for the moments where some technical workflow is beyond my grasp and will lean on AI to help me back on track so I can finish it and move on to next one. There are times though I wish AI had more useful features I could use (ie. like synthesizing all of the data on the spreadsheet and then creating an overview 'big-picture' look of what the numbers and text on the sheet mean, and analyze it to make objective observations that could help provide me with insights on how well something is working or point out the issues and potential root causes of them. These type of insights would be extremely beneficial for me because since I have a learning disability, Im not always able to produce quickly enough the analytical problem-solving skills in my tool belt without sacrificing a significant amount of time and effort into that one troubling task.

AI: Thank you for sharing that perspective about balancing skill development with practical efficiency - and for being so open about how your learning disability factors into how you think about AI's potential benefits. That insight about wanting AI to help with data synthesis and pattern recognition sounds like it could be really powerful for your work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: The way I see this relationship naturally evolving is that the more accustomed I become with using the AI model to assist me in the areas of operations administration I need more experience with, the more opportunities I foresee myself into learning from what the AI produces and hopefully over time and with repetition, I too will become more comfortable and proficient with producing the detailed manner in which AI answers a question or completes a task but will be able to do it myself with a more 'humanized' touch because there are certain cases where it's pretty comically obvious that AI responded or created a type of answer/communication because there is a built-in robotic tone that is ingrained within it's code that will require human-intervention to fix or correct so then the desired tone is shared with the appropriate audience. The more I familiarize myself with how these AI tools operate the more likely I will want to use it into my daily workflow because if Im able to achieve a higher rate of operational efficiency then I can show my manager that I am also capable of taking on more responsibilities in business finance areas of work I am very interested in developing, learning them so I can continue growing in my career field.

AI: That's a really insightful way to think about it - using AI as a learning tool to eventually develop those capabilities yourself, while recognizing where that human touch remains essential.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on strategically choosing which tasks to preserve for your own development and how you're thinking about AI as a bridge to help you grow into new areas of responsibility.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing else is coming to mind because I think I've been able to share the majority of valuable experiences and insights I have gleamed from using it during my workday.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing professional development with efficiency, the importance of user experience design in AI tools, and how you're strategically thinking about AI as a learning partner will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful and detailed your responses were throughout our conversation. Have a great rest of your day!
