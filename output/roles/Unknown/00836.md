Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good to you?

User: Yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm working as a content creator, primarily for YouTube right now. I'm using AI daily, to research video topic ideas, to write scripts for videos, for generating video clips and images to use in my videos, for narrating the scripts, for setting up metadata for the videos, responding to viewer comments...

AI: That's quite a comprehensive integration of AI into your workflow. You mentioned using AI for everything from initial research through to engaging with your audience afterward.

Tell me more about how you use AI for research and topic ideas - what does that process look like for you?

User: Typically, I select a broad topic, and then chat with AI to flesh out the ideas. My channel focuses on ancient religious texts that are prominent, but which fall outside the canon for mainstream religions. For instance, I'm in the middle of a series on Gnosticism. A typical day might involve speaking with AI to strategize the next video topic, examining the topics we've already covered and what can be related but different enough to not feel like we're rehashing the same bits over and over.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful collaborative process - using AI to help you map out content strategy while maintaining originality across your series.

When you're working with AI to develop these video topics, how do you typically structure that conversation? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth throughout the process, or do you tend to give AI a brief and let it generate options for you to choose from?

User: Both actually. Sometimes I'll come in with a focused topic and will use AI to help flesh the idea out, but if I don't have a clear direction in mind, I will have a conversation with AI to brainstorm ideas and then will usually have pretty in-depth conversations trying to figure out the path. Sometimes I'm pressed for time so I'll let the AI drive the ship.

AI: So it sounds like your approach really depends on where you are in your creative process and your time constraints. You mentioned sometimes letting AI "drive the ship" when you're pressed for time.

Can you walk me through what that looks like? What does it mean for AI to take the lead, and how does that feel different from those more collaborative brainstorming sessions?

User: While I'm very interested in the topics we're covering, I'm no expert in them. There are times when my own personal "knowledge cutoff" limits the potential input I have, and that's where I let AI take a bigger role. For instance, I've done videos on the "Book of Enoch" of which I have a base knowledge (the Watchers, the Nephilim, etc.) but I'm mostly familiar with 1 Enoch... once I'm out of ideas, I rely on AI to expand the topics (our next video is on Enoch's transition into Metatron, which is more detailed in 2 Enoch and 3 Enoch which I'm far less familiar with). AI helped me here by a) suggesting a topic I probably wouldn't have thought of on my own, and b) handling the "heavy lifting" when it comes to familiarizing myself with the topic in order to make a sufficient video.

AI: That's a fascinating example of how AI can extend your expertise into areas where your own knowledge has gaps. It sounds like AI becomes almost like a research partner when you're venturing into these less familiar territories.

When AI is doing that "heavy lifting" of familiarizing you with complex material like 2 Enoch and 3 Enoch, how do you ensure the information is accurate enough for your content? Do you have ways of verifying what AI provides, or have you developed a sense of trust in its knowledge of these texts?

User: Well, we're dealing with ancient texts that were written in ancient languages and are often only available as translations of translations of fragments of texts, so a lot of the information is subjective and open to interpretation, so there's not much point in verifying it that way (I've watched many theological discussions on some of these topics and different scholars read things very differently, so I don't think this is an area to put too much time into). My preference is to include direct references from texts, and in those cases I like to verify that the passages are accurate (at least according to scholarly translations). Even if I'm not an expert, I'm familiar enough with the texts to know if something sounds off

AI: That's a really practical approach given the interpretive nature of your subject matter. It sounds like your familiarity with the texts gives you a kind of "gut check" for when AI might be going off track.

Are there certain tasks in your content creation process where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to "steer the ship" more directly when it comes to the visual elements, the pacing of the videos, and the overall channel aesthetics. I tried to use AI to create a logo and other elements like that, but was not impressed and, anyway, my background is in graphic design so I'm more comfortable in those areas anyway.

AI: That makes sense - you're drawing on your existing expertise in graphic design and keeping creative control over the visual identity of your channel.

When you think about the pacing and overall aesthetics of your videos, what is it about those elements that makes you want to maintain direct control? What would feel different if AI were handling more of that side?

User: As smart as AI is, it's not human, so there's just no way (as far as I'm aware) that AI can discern when a passage is narrated too quickly, or too slowly. Even in script writing, AI (or at least ChatGPT) uses lots of dashes and bulleted lists, which reads fine in a report but when being narrated, often sounds clunky. Sometimes a passage needs a few seconds of silence after it to really emphasize a point, for instance, and AI just doesn't seem to grasp this. I would love it if AI could handle this for me as it's where I spend the most amount of time, but sadly I haven't been happy with the results anytime I've tried to let go of the steering wheel.

AI: That's such an insightful observation about the nuances of audio pacing and human communication that AI seems to miss. Those pauses for emphasis, the rhythm of spoken versus written language - those really are distinctly human sensitivities.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're creating content independently, I'm curious about whether other creators, your audience, or the broader YouTube community has shaped your approach to AI use?

User: I've seen many other creators take what appears to be a less hands-on approach, and the results are what I use to learn what not to do. As amazing as AI is, I don't think the public (in general terms) is aware of the prevalence of its usage, but you can sort of tell when AI is used to make a video poorly.

AI: That's a really interesting way to learn - using what you see as poor AI implementation by others as a guide for your own boundaries. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've told ChatGPT to stop using dashes in scripts so many times that I've finally stopped requesting it, no matter if it's committed to "memory" it still does what it wants. AI seems to struggle remembering what we've alread completed, and that can be frustrating when brainstorming new ideas. Often, image generation tools will widely vary image styles even if explicitly told not to do so (we don't want manga-style animated scenes in a video about the Gospel of Judas). Those are all frustrating.

AI: Those sound like genuinely frustrating limitations - the repetitive formatting issues, the memory gaps, and the inconsistent visual styles despite clear instructions.

On the flip side, has there been a moment when AI really delivered for you in a way that felt particularly satisfying or successful?

User: Gemini's Veo 3 clips are usually pretty amazing. In terms of researching the topics, AI does far more than I can do, in seconds. With AI I can produce an entire 12-minute video in a day, but if I had to handle everything myself, it would take weeks... I'd say that's pretty successful.

AI: That's an incredible acceleration - from weeks to a single day for a 12-minute video. That kind of efficiency gain really transforms what's possible for your channel.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Honestly I'm making these videos for this very reason. AI is already taking over in the "real world" and it will only get worse. The more people who are out of work because of it, the more people who will be a) seeking fulfillment and looking for deeper meaning to life, and b) have time to watch videos. I'm sure at some point AI will take the video creation over as well, but for now, I think using it as a tool and adding my personal style is the best course of action. AI can simulate art, but I think it will be a while before it's truly able to become an artist.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on positioning yourself ahead of these changes while they're happening. You're essentially creating content for an audience that AI displacement might be creating.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops, or do you think you'll maintain a similar collaborative approach?

User: Hopefully as it improves, it will take over the more mundane tasks (like video pacing) and will allow more time for me to handle brand building.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a research partner when you're exploring unfamiliar territories in ancient texts, and how you've learned to set boundaries based on observing what doesn't work well for other creators.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope I'm good!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI efficiency with human creative control, especially in such a specialized content area, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with your Gnosticism series and your channel!
