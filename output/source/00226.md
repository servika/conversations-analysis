Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: This sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use it for writing tasks. Sometimes I'll use it to help me work through an issue.

AI: Tell me more about those writing tasks. What specific types of writing do you find yourself turning to AI for?

User: I'll often have it help me draft an email or a new policy I need to write. Today I had it help me draft a script for a webinar. I also use it to help me edit and improve writing.

AI: That's helpful context. When you say you use it to help work through an issue - can you walk me through what that looks like? What kind of issues do you bring to AI?

User: If I have employee issues I need to think through, I'll sometimes ask AI for ideas on how to approach the issue.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to do a lot of work in Excel on my own, even though I know I could likely ask AI to help. I also prefer to edit writing myself. I try to only turn to AI for editing when I just can't think of how to reword something.

AI: What is it about Excel work and editing that makes you want to keep those tasks for yourself?

User: I enjoy them. They are often a break from other more thought intense work that I have to do.

AI: That's interesting - you see them as a mental break. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate throughout a task.

AI: Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like? Walk me through how you and AI worked together on one of those recent tasks you mentioned.

User: If I'm stuck drafting an email, I'll give it prompts and request it give me a draft. Then I will often tweak what the AI model gives me and feed it back to ask for any additional suggestions.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I have one colleague who is using it for more for analyzing and summarizing data. I think I may start seeing if I can apply this use to other areas of work.

AI: What's made you hesitate to try those data analysis tasks so far, versus jumping right into the writing tasks?

User: The data analysis is much more complex so I have to figure out the best way to feed the data to the mode. Some concerns have also been raised regarding privacy so I have to look into that further.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It helped me come up with a bonus model for my staff and I felt that was very satisfying as it was something I'd been stumped on for awhile

AI: That sounds like a meaningful breakthrough. What about the bonus model had you stumped, and how did AI help you work through it?

User: I just couldn't figure out a way to really make it work. The model gave me a great structure to work with. I was able to use it to develop a robust structure.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No I do not worry about this. I think AI is more likely to help me work more efficiently.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine I find more complex ways to work it into my role.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on keeping certain tasks like Excel work for yourself as mental breaks, and how you're thinking about gradually expanding into more complex applications.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you collaborate with AI throughout tasks, your thoughtful approach to which work you keep for yourself, and your plans to gradually expand into more complex uses will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
