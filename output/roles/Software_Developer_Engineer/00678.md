Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's go for it

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't have any regular use, but I sometimes use it for quick, low-stakes answers to questions. Depending on the results I may use it as a jumping off point before going further. I'll also use it for writing simple things, responses, emails, etc. I'm planning on developing an app related to a rental business I run and I don't know much about coding or development so I have started using AI in that capacity.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned using it for "quick, low-stakes answers" and as a jumping off point. Can you tell me more about what makes you decide whether a question is low-stakes versus something you'd want to research more thoroughly yourself?

User: low-stakes as in it doesn't really matter if the AI isn't 100% correct. Maybe I'm looking for something close, sometimes using that as a starting point and then look at the sources or continue my search

AI: I see - so the consequences of potentially inaccurate information help you decide when to use AI. 

When you mentioned using AI for writing emails and responses, how do you typically work with it during that process? Do you give it a full draft to write, or are you more hands-on throughout the writing?

User: Correct, I don't take every answer as fact. For emails or responses, I generally provide an idea with the important parts and then will adjust through additional turns.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds useful. You also mentioned starting to use AI for app development for your rental business, which seems like a bigger project than quick emails or answers.

How has that experience been different from your other AI interactions? What's it been like working with AI on something where you don't have much coding background?

User: So far I'm early in the process so I haven't started any of the coding work. Just some general brainstorming and platform research

AI: Got it - you're still in the planning phase. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Anything where factual accuracy is important I prefer to do myself. Or at least use AI as an assistant

AI: That makes sense - factual accuracy being a key factor in your decision-making.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself using it differently based on your work environment?

User: No, I don't base my usage on other people. And I don't have any pressure to do so.

AI: That's good that you have the freedom to use it as you see fit.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Honestly, no. I haven't used it in a way where it would elicit those types of emotions. I guess we'll see when I start really getting into the app development.

AI: That's a fair point - it sounds like your current uses have been pretty straightforward without major highs or lows.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm self-employed so AI taking over would mean I'm doing less work, I guess.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - being self-employed does give you a different relationship with AI potentially handling tasks.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Especially as you get deeper into that app development project?

User: As AI improves I'm sure I will be using it more for general tasks, or automated tasks. I'll have to see how well it does with the app development project and go from there.

AI: That makes sense - letting the results of the app development experience guide your future use.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your measured, practical approach to AI - particularly how you use consequence level and factual accuracy as decision points for when and how to engage with AI tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about taking a cautious, practical approach - especially using AI for low-stakes questions and as a starting point rather than a definitive source - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with your app development project! It'll be interesting to see how that experience shapes your future use of AI tools.
