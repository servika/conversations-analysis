Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! No questions!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I do a lot of different creative work. My most recent work has consisted of crocheting neon bucket hats for some teenagers going to a festival. I also do watercolor, macrame, and I write stories and poems. I've also sold furniture I've refurbished among other things.

AI: That's such a diverse range of creative work! It sounds like you really enjoy exploring different mediums and practical applications. I can picture those neon bucket hats being perfect for a festival.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I don't use AI too often because I really enjoy my creative process, but it as been really helpful for some tasks. I will use it to edit things that I've written or help find a suitable color palette for a painting idea I have. If I get stuck on a macrame knot or crochet stitch it has helped me quicker than searching myself does.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you use AI more as a targeted helper for specific moments when you hit a roadblock, rather than as a constant creative companion. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Actually, this is really cool. I saw an image on the internet a couple weeks ago and it instantly inspired me to want to paint something. I uploaded the image to AI and explained my idea for the painting and asked the AI to pull out the colors from the image that I would need and tell me the names. That was very helpful because I didn't have to go through the tedious task of mixing colors and doing a sample sheet to find the perfect shades.

AI: That's such a practical use! I love how you turned what could have been a tedious color-matching process into something much more efficient. It sounds like the AI helped you get to the actual painting part faster.

When you're working with AI in moments like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm definitely driving the creative decisions. It was my idea to begin with, the AI just helped me streamline the process so I could get to the fun part quicker. I am very cautious of keeping the creativity mine. I'm worried about AI taking humanity from the arts so I try to use AI as little as possible.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a tool to handle the more mechanical aspects while preserving the human creative core. I can hear that maintaining your own creative agency is really important to you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Just that I'm a little quicker now. The tedious tasks that come along with art, mostly the planning, are a little easier now. MY art and MY creative process are still the same.

AI: I can really hear how intentional you are about preserving your core creative process. It sounds like AI has become a way to handle some of the prep work without touching the heart of what makes your art yours.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Just what I said earlier, I hate that humanity could be taken out of art. Even when humans create really beautiful things people will think it's AI or something. Though, the value of real true proven human art could be appreciated more in the future too, who knows?

AI: That's such an insightful perspective - the idea that authentic human creativity might actually become more valued as AI becomes more prevalent. It's interesting how you're thinking about both the risks and potential opportunities.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Hopefully not at all. I feel like I've already included AI as much as I'd like to.

AI: That's a really clear boundary you've set for yourself. It sounds like you've found that sweet spot where AI helps with just enough of the tedious tasks without encroaching on what you love most about creating.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI only for the mechanical prep work while fiercely protecting the human heart of your creativity - and how you think authentic human art might actually become more valued over time.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative agency and using AI as a very targeted tool for specific tasks will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about your concerns and boundaries - that kind of thoughtful approach to integrating AI while preserving what makes your work uniquely yours is exactly the kind of perspective we were hoping to learn about.

Have a wonderful rest of your day, and best of luck with your future creative projects!
