Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, I'm ready to proceed

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am an actress and work on various creative projects within the film industry. I am working on brainstorming ideas for my own scenes and short films. I work on crafting introductions to myself and letters to various people within the industry. I work on script and scene analysis.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of creative work across the film industry. You're juggling everything from the analytical side with script work to the more personal branding aspects with introductions and industry outreach.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I like reaching for AI tools to assist me in a variety of ways. For example, I may be short on time, or just struggling to understand something within a script in which case I will use an AI tool to help me in the process of script analysis and understanding the scene as a whole, or even a line that I was unsure about. I may enquire as to different styles of acting required by sides I was given. For example, if I'm sent audition sides without much context about the project, I may use an I tool to aid my research and understand the likely genre and style of acting required. When crafting letters I also like to use AI as a second set of eyes. And I like to catch up with AI tools on some more general stuff, like working on my branding and brainstorming plotlines and scenes which would be good for me to film to show my skills and strengths. I may also enquire about some contractual information, as an initial set of eyes so I can look more into any potential issues found.

AI: That's really fascinating - it sounds like AI has become quite an integral part of your toolkit across so many different aspects of your work, from the interpretive work with scripts to the business side with contracts and branding.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently, I had a chemistry read that I needed to prepare for at short notice, and my acting coach was unavailable to help. Since I could not get support from my know industry contacts, I worked on it on my own with the support of an AI tool. We discussed the scene together, and the AI helped to offer some different perspectives. We also talked about some general things about the project and the chemistry read. I discussed some worries, and the AI helped me to formulate some questions to ask to clarify a few things.

AI: That sounds like a really practical example of AI stepping in when your usual support network wasn't available. It's interesting that you describe it as discussing and working on it "together" with the AI.

When you're working with AI in situations like that chemistry read prep, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: Well it depends really, there was something in the script which I was really unsure about. A line which just did not make sense to me. I had come up with an interpretation and I approached the AI in a manner like "Hey, what do you think she means here? [insert line and script]. I think that she means x but I'm not 100% sure". The AI gave me a totally different interpretation which immediately clicked- it turns out I was reading far too deeply into the line when the explanation was much more simpler. This helped out a lot. Other times, I definitely knew some things about the character already so I was in charge of some creative decisions like I knew that she wasn't saying a certain line because she genuinely felt bad etc. due to my prior knowledge of the whole script and the role my character plays. In these cases, I would steer the AI into the right direction of how to interpret her intentions.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - sometimes the AI offers a perspective that completely shifts your understanding, like with that line you were overthinking, and other times you're guiding the AI based on your deeper knowledge of the character and story.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: It helps me manage my time better, and provides some relief for when I have a particularly busy schedule with tight deadlines, and am not able to work with my coach. This helps keeps stress down, I know that I can get some quick help in a moment when I just don't have time or energy to work on something on my own. This can help me get more done, and get it done quicker.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that reliable backup when you're under pressure sounds really valuable. It sounds like AI has become a bit of a safety net for you when the usual resources aren't available.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Well, AI can definitely sometimes get things wrong and may not always understand some nuances. It's important that working with the AI is a collaboration process, rather than just a solution like "Oh I can't be bothered to do this script analysis so I will let the AI do it and I will just run with whatever choices it makes". Going down that line has a potential to stifle creativity and create work which is safe, surface level and not authentic. AI can be great as a partner, but it needs to be used right. It needs to challenge you to think as well, and you need to challenge it, otherwise if everyone used it, things would really start coming out the same and lacking in real depth and humanity. Of course there is a bigger worry about AI replacing actors, and there's a lot of debate about this as some people think it can happen and will happen while others say that AI can never replicate the inner life that happens beyond people's eyes and that's what makes them compelling to watch.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns, especially that distinction between using AI as a collaborative partner versus letting it do the work for you. Your point about maintaining authenticity and avoiding that "safe, surface level" work really resonates.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I really think that AI can become a second coach and partner, for times when you need a little extra help. It can also help with career management, as well as accounting and being an extra set of eyes to review documents. I think that it will be able to process much more information more intelligibly e.g. whole scripts. And it will be able to process information about actors, for example, it can review our work, headshots, casting profiles etc. to give real-tailored, intelligent advice. I think it can be great for feedback for self-tapes, which I know many actors would find really beneficial. It can also definitely act as a real time, intuitive reader for self tapes for times when you can't get someone to help. This is a hard industry to navigate, and as AI gets more advanced I think that it will be able to really help actors in all aspects of their work and careers.

AI: Those are some really compelling possibilities - especially the idea of AI being able to give real-time feedback on self-tapes and serving as an intelligent reader. It sounds like you see AI potentially becoming much more integrated into the practical, day-to-day challenges actors face.

You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the importance of maintaining that collaborative balance - using AI as a partner rather than letting it drive all the creative decisions, and how that authenticity and human depth needs to be preserved.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: There are a lot of things I could still mention. Something which I've noticed recently which isn't great is that AI often tries to change the whole tone of something I've written. I'm like 'woah this just doesn't sound like me' and the AI can be very stubborn to change. I have to put in a lot of work for it to understand how I write and that I want to preserve my essence. It can also sometimes offer unsolicited advice. But I find ways around most things. Some AI tools can be great for giving guidance and advice, like when you ask it "Is this appropriate?", "What's the best way to handle this situation?". It can really help you spot red flags too. Contractually, it's definitely helped me in the past.

AI: That's a really valuable point about AI sometimes being too heavy-handed with changes and not preserving your voice. It sounds like there's this ongoing negotiation to maintain your authentic style while still getting the help you need.

And the unsolicited advice piece is interesting too - it's like finding that balance between when you want guidance and when you just want collaboration on your terms.

Thank you so much for sharing all of these insights today. You've given me a really rich picture of how AI fits into your work as an actress - from the practical day-to-day support with script analysis and prep work, to the bigger questions about maintaining authenticity and creative control. Your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement, and the importance of challenging each other in that process, has been particularly illuminating.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.
