Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will help improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good. No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it sometimes to help me figure out how to express something that's tricky to say. I've also used it for general research and also for drafting schedules.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI for some pretty diverse purposes. 

Tell me more about those tricky communication situations. What makes something difficult to express, and how does AI help you work through that?

User: Sometimes what I need to say could sound abrupt or rude, so I'll use it to help me come up with a more diplomatic way of saying it. Or sometimes there are a lot of moving parts to a message, so I use AI to help me figure out a concise, logical way to express it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - navigating tone and complexity in communication can be really challenging.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes - especially for general writing, especially if I'm writing something where I really want to connect with the reader (or listener, if it's a speech), because I know it needs to be authentic, from a real person, and in my own voice.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making about authenticity and voice.

When you do use AI for work - like with those diplomatic messages or research tasks - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Usually it's just one piece - like a specific reply to one email in a thread - that I need help drafting. Or for research, I'll have a general idea of what I'm looking for but use AI when I get stuck or can't readily find what I'm looking for.

AI: So it sounds like you're using AI more as a targeted problem-solver for specific moments when you hit a roadblock.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Colleagues in the sense that I see them using AI for stuff that they really could/should do themselves - that makes me shy away from it. I don't want it to become a crutch like it is for some. Workplace culture in that I need to be careful not to reveal confidential information to the AI.

AI: That's really insightful - you're being thoughtful about both the dependency aspect and the confidentiality considerations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Frustrated when I was trying to figure out a complicated schedule for the team. I gave the AI very specific parameters, but its first few attempts ignored obvious pieces of the instructions. It took several rounds of my pointing out the problems before it finally got it right. In the end, it still saved me time, but it wasn't the push-button solution I'd hoped for. I would hope AI gets better along this line.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of the gap between expectations and reality with AI tools.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's on my radar but I'm not overly concerned about it. I think there will always be a need for people to do the creative thinking to come up with ways to use and steer it. The engineering aspect. If I were only doing grunt work, then yes, I'd be concerned about it taking over my work. But instead I view it as a useful tool that I can offload tasks to, freeing up my mental calories to burn on bigger, more important things.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing AI as freeing up capacity for higher-level work rather than replacing you entirely.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will be used increasingly, but at a very slow pace, as my company becomes more and more comfortable with it. It will take a long time and a lot of safeguards first.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI strategically while being mindful of not letting it become a crutch, and how you think about it as freeing up mental capacity for more important work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that a lot of people misunderstand what AI is and how to use it. But if you know what it is and what it isn't, it can be a very powerful tool. I just hope that it continues to improve, that we aren't at the plateau yet, because there are still a lot of glitches, especially with hallucinations.

AI: That's a really valuable point about understanding what AI is and isn't - and the ongoing challenges with reliability that still need to be addressed.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about strategic AI use, the importance of maintaining authenticity in communication, and the realistic view of both AI's potential and current limitations will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
