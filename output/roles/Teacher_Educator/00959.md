Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.  No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a teacher at an online school and use AI for many different tasks.  I have it rewrite science material so it can be better understood by my below grade level students.  I use it to brainstorm fun ways to provide student feedback.  I have it change formatting of email messages, for example, to add or remove emojis, change bullets to numbering, etc.  I use it to look over or write emails to address certain issues, like creationism, gently but firmly.  I have used it for translation into Arabic and checking our curriculum against the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (our state's learning objectives).  I have also used it to brainstorm off the beaten path field trip ideas in my area.  I've also asked AI for advice on managing certain behaviors among students, such as attention-seeking attempts during lessons.

AI: That's quite a range of uses! It sounds like AI has become integrated into many different aspects of your teaching work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I rarely have AI generate emails because those are quick and easy most of the time and I use AI to save time generally.  I certainly would not have it grade any student work since I trust my thirty years of teaching experience more than AI.  I don't often ask it factual questions without also checking other sources to verify the answer.  I do not have it write my yearly self-evaluation essays either because I know what I want to say and want to make sure it is personalized to me.  My writing is good enough that I don't feel the need to use AI for my self-evaluations and I would be mortified if my supervisor thought I used AI for it.  I avoid using any AI generated images in my work since there are plenty of science images available in our curriculum and online at copy-right free sites.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed clear boundaries around tasks where your expertise and personal touch are most valuable.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually have it collaborate with me on tasks.  For example, I might have it rewrite my text to sound silly, be more fun with emojis, or follow a certain theme relating to the time of year or what we are learning at the time to increase engagement with my middle school students.  During this process I input my original boring text and I have it refine the output with instructions like "more dad jokes," "can you make five but make it a biology theme," or my favorite "make it sound less cringy."

AI: I love that example - "make it sound less cringy" is such a practical refinement! It sounds like you're really working together to find that sweet spot for engaging your middle schoolers.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I am one of the first who started using it and am still one of only a few who have welcomed it.  Most teachers do not embrace technology and some also feel that they must do everything themselves with a "woe is me" attitude.  I have never been like that.  I find it interesting that we are being pressured by admin and some other teachers to teach students how to use AI to help with their writing, but most students just have the model generate their entire piece of writing instead.  My workplace on the whole looks down on using AI but no one has gotten reprimanded for it.  We are trusted to get our jobs done efficiently.  I only share the extent of my use with a few people at work.  I have convinced colleagues to start using it to refine their writing or brainstorm and some felt genuinely guilty before they realized that it is a tool like other tools and that they more time we save on routine tasks, the more time we have to help our students learn.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're navigating some mixed signals there, being encouraged to teach AI use to students while facing resistance from colleagues about your own use.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would say that when it helped me hone my email to a student regarding his concern that our curriculum states that much of the water on Earth came from comets, I was extremely satisfied.  The student emailed saying that water came from God.  We are in a Bible Belt state yet I was not willing to back down because this is a science class, not a religion class.  I wrote an email stating what I wanted to say-basically that religious beliefs are fine but we don't study those in science.  We study the evidence in science class.  I then asked AI how it might be interpreted by the student (but took this with a grain of salt).  At first it was not firm enough and stated that it is great that they shared their religious views and it's fine to believe in that instead of science.  But I wanted to make sure it was firm yet understanding but stated that science class is not really a place for religion.  Once I let it know that it should not depict science and religion as equally applicable to a science class, I got a very high quality output that had tweaked my writing to add those qualities I was looking for.   Also, the email was well-received by the student.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful process - using AI to help you navigate such a delicate situation while maintaining your educational standards. It's interesting how you had to guide it to get the right balance.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My 30 years of teaching experience will protect me to a great extent as long as I work at a place that values and respects it.  I always reflect and get better, too, which provides some additional value versus that of AI.

AI: That confidence in your expertise really comes through. You seem to view AI as enhancing rather than threatening your core teaching skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can't really know until I know what future generations of AI are capable of.  I use it for so many things now that I am not necessarily confident that I will use it more in the future.  I do think that as AI models get better at interpreting instructions, I will need to spend less time getting a model to give me the output I want.  It often takes several rounds to get what I really want, but I can definitely imagine that my use will evolve by allowing me to spend less time per task than I do now.  Since my main use of AI is to save time, this would give me even more time to work with my students, which is my true purpose.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed clear boundaries around where AI fits in your teaching practice, and how you're using it to create more time for what matters most - working directly with your students.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in education - from handling sensitive topics like the science-religion balance to finding ways to make content more engaging for middle schoolers - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the practical benefits and the workplace dynamics you're navigating. Take care!
