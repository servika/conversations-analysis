Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a high school teacher, I use AI semi-regularly for AI detection in student writing, lesson planning, and research for course content.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across several different aspects of teaching. 

Can you walk me through what AI detection in student writing looks like for you? How does that process work in practice?

User: When I receive typed writing from students that appears to have the hallmarks of AI-generated text, I will copy and paste the text - or chunks of it - into several sites that check fro AI generation to verify or oppose my concerns.

AI: That gives me a clear picture of your process. When you say "hallmarks of AI-generated text," what are you actually noticing that makes you think a piece might be AI-generated? What catches your attention first?

User: Em dashes are very typical of AI-generated texts, as are certain phrasal structures and organizational concepts. Additionally, when I can see words that are used incorrectly or are out-of-place, I can assume that a student tried to replace AI-generated content with synonymous words and phrases.

AI: That's fascinating - you've developed quite a keen eye for these patterns. It sounds like you're doing some detective work, especially with those synonym replacements.

Tell me more about the lesson planning side of your AI use. How does AI fit into that process for you?

User: AI is a great tool for lesson planning. Often, I have the idea for a concept that I need to cover in class or spend more time on, but I struggle to either generate ideas for activities and texts or find new ways to present them when students struggle. AI has also proven incredibly useful to me when searching for quotes or passages in longer texts we read so I can streamline my process for creating course materials and resources.

AI: That sounds like AI is really helping you solve some practical challenges. When you say you struggle to generate ideas for activities - can you give me an example of a time when AI helped you break through that kind of creative block? What did that interaction look like?

User: I have several lessons on crucial content like connecting motif and theme, and I have taught that concept the same way for years. When learning gaps present themselves in student struggles, it is difficult for me to leave my mental wheelhouse to find new and creative ways to present the same idea. Ai has helped me to find new ways to represent the concept visually - mind maps namely - to help students see how many thematic ideas can stem from one motif or vice versa.

AI: That's a really concrete example of how AI helped you approach an old challenge in a new way. The visual representation angle is interesting.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain teaching tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I enjoy the challenge of structuring lesson plans on writing as that is my favorite part of teaching ELA. I know that AI could help me generate new ideas and structure fun lesson plans, but I have so much varied and valuable experience in that sphere that I often do not find a pressing need to consult AI models.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like writing instruction is where you feel most confident in your expertise and creativity. 

When you do use AI for the tasks we've talked about - like lesson planning or finding quotes - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: Usually, it is a back-and-forth process as I ask for examples, examine them, and then request more just to have the AI model present more past the initial options. I find it good to have variety and choice.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really practical - getting options and then asking for more to expand your choices.

How have your colleagues or your school's culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any discussion or guidance around AI use in your workplace?

User: Several of my colleagues have used and suggested that I use a specific AI model for lesson planning, but I cannot remember the name off the top of my head. They all find this function of AI incredibly useful for brainstorming plans and then tweaking them to meet specific student needs.

AI: It sounds like there's a supportive atmosphere around AI use among your colleagues, at least for lesson planning.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I once used an AI model to compose an essay with a prompt I assigned my students. I then, through three subsequent prompts, was able to get the AI model to tweak that same essay to look almost exactly as I expect a student's to without sacrificing the quality of the content. I ran this AI-generated essay through countless AI checkers, and each identified zero percent AI usage in the paper despite its being 100% AI-generated. I was disappointed to find that five minutes of minimal work and thinking could create a B+ essay that would trigger no Ai checkers.

AI: That's a really powerful and unsettling discovery - finding that gap between what AI can produce and what detection tools can catch. It sounds like that experience shifted your perspective in some way.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think AI is, has been, and will continue to be a useful tool for teachers to broaden their horizons as they look to teach the same concepts in new, exciting, and different ways.

AI: That's an optimistic view of AI as expanding your toolkit. It sounds like you see it more as enhancing your teaching capabilities rather than replacing them.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as you get more comfortable with it?

User: I think it will mostly remain the same. Any more evolution in AI that I would find useful seems that it would be moving me out of teaching and into facilitation of content. I would not want to cede more control of what I do right now to AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction between teaching and facilitation - it sounds like you have a clear sense of where you want to draw that line.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that eye-opening experiment with creating and testing the student essay - that really illustrated the complexity of the detection challenge you're facing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your teaching that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I have exhausted my list of AI benefits to teachers, and I am glad to have so many valuable uses and resources at my fingertips!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical ways you're using AI - from detecting student use to collaborating on lesson planning - along with your thoughtful boundaries around where you do and don't want AI involved, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective as an educator navigating these tools. Thanks again!

User: No problem!

AI: Thank you so much for participating in this interview! Your insights as a high school teacher using AI have been really valuable. Have a great rest of your day!
