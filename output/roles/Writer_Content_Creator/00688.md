Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a copyeditor, so I use it to double-check grammar and punctuation especially if I'm working on non-Australian content. I also use it to rewrite passages that don't sound right.

AI: That's really interesting that you mention non-Australian content specifically. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for rewriting passages that don't sound right - what does that process look like for you?

User: Sometimes a sentence, paragraph or even longer won't read well. It might be too wordy, or use the same word repetitively, or be confusing to read. I use AI to find alternative ways of phrasing the text without losing tone or meaning.

AI: That sounds like a nuanced process - preserving tone and meaning while improving readability. 

When you encounter text that doesn't read well, what makes you decide to use AI for rewriting versus tackling the rewrite yourself?

User: I always try to do it myself first, but if I'm not happy with what I come up with or feel like I need a 'second opinion', I will use AI. Sometimes I blend my work with AI's for the optimal result.

AI: That blending approach is fascinating - combining your work with AI's suggestions. 

Can you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? How do you decide which parts of your version to keep versus which parts of the AI's version to incorporate?

User: Generally, it's just a gut feel for what is going to work better in the context of the whole document. Because AI doesn't have access to the entire document, sometimes the suggestions don't work, and I'll keep what I've written. Sometimes, AI will provide the perfect word or phrase, and I will incorporate that into my editing. If I have a particularly bad mental block or am tired and just can't work out how the text should read, I will use AI's suggestion. I prefer to blend the work as I feel like I'm cheating a bit otherwise.

AI: That feeling about "cheating" is really insightful. 

Can you tell me more about that - what makes blending feel different from using AI's suggestion outright?

User: The author is paying me to edit their work, so using AI sometimes feels like the easy route. I know that the author wouldn't be able to edit their own work, even using AI, as it is a judgement call as to what needs fixing or changing.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on your professional responsibility to the author.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you discuss these tools with other copyeditors?

User: No, I'm a freelancer, so I don't have much contact with other copyeditors. I know there is a lot of discussion about AI taking over the job though, and the general view is that AI will be a tool that editors use to help them in their work.

AI: That isolation as a freelancer must make it interesting to navigate these tools on your own terms.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently edited an autobiography of an elderly gentleman. He wasn't a great writer, but wanted to leave his life story for his family. I found editing this document difficult because he used the same phrases a lot throughout the text. AI was good for finding unique ways to say the same thing when I had used up all my vocabulary.

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful project to work on - helping preserve someone's life story for their family.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think AI will ever completely take over copyediting, as so much of it is about human judgement, empathy and lived experience. Authors are also a funny breed who like to speak in person and share more stories and information when they discuss their writing. This is not something an AI can replace.

AI: That human connection with authors sounds like such an important part of what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm not too sure what the future will hold for copyediting and AI. I have no doubt it will be used more frequently and widely in both writing and editing but I don't know what that means for me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the ethical considerations around using AI when authors are paying for your expertise, and how you've found ways to blend your work with AI's suggestions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we have covered everything

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced way you balance AI assistance with your professional judgment, and how you navigate that sense of responsibility to your authors, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
