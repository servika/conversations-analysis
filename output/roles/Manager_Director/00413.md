Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me. Please go right ahead.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I rarely use AI for my job in property management. When I do it's usually for informational searches in conjunction with google to find out legal information or deal with government regulations and ensuring compliance

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're being quite selective about when you bring AI into your work. 

Tell me more about those informational searches. What does that process typically look like when you're researching legal information or government regulations?

User: I usually enter in a search like, "How do I set up garbage service for a commercial tenant. How do I ensure it's in their name?"

AI: I see - so you're using it for those specific procedural questions that come up in property management.

When you're doing these searches, are you typically using AI alongside Google, or do you find yourself going to one first and then the other? What drives that decision for you?

User: Yeah, usually google and AI. I find the AI results on google explain a lot of what I'm going to need to do before I read the government information.

AI: That's a helpful pattern - using AI to get that initial understanding before diving into the official sources.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in property management that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I'm unsure. I guess it could probably be good for writing e-mails to tenants, and for legal purposes. But usually I'm happy once I get the information to a point where it makes sense and send the e-mails anyway. I guess it could help with calculations, but once I enter in a few numbers into a spreadsheet I usually get the answers I want for those. A lot of it feels like I avoid using AI for it because it would involve extra work for higher quality that is of negligible importance.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - the extra work for higher quality that's of negligible importance. 

Can you give me an example of what you mean by that? Like, what would that extra work look like if you were to use AI for something like writing emails to tenants?

User: Like if I'm writing an email to a tenant, once I've figured out the main points and put them into a sentence I've got a good enough email for them to understand what needs to be understood. Adding on AI to refine the letter is an extra step in the process.

AI: That makes complete sense - you've already solved the core problem once you've got the main points across clearly.

When you do use AI for those informational searches we talked about earlier, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it, or do you tend to ask your question and take what it gives you?

User: I haven't had much of a back and forth with it in regards to property management, though as I do more research into investing into Japanese properties it has been somewhat helpful in understanding specific information and I've had back and forth from that. But in regards to my job in general, it's usually specific searches.

AI: Interesting - so your interaction style actually varies depending on the context. With your day-to-day property management work it's more of a specific query, but with the Japanese property investment research you're having more of a conversation.

What's different about that Japanese property research that makes you engage with AI in a more back-and-forth way?

User: It's that I don't know what I need to know, and I've got no processes in place so I'm starting from the ground up. With my current job, as long as I follow the processes, there's few questions I need to address, and I'm familiar with a lot of the regulation already in my home country and province.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - when you're working within established processes versus exploring completely new territory.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about AI use with coworkers, or is it something you're figuring out on your own?

User: Not really. It's not something that comes up, and my boss is very slow at adapting new technology as they're a senior and anything beyond facebook and email is too complicated for them.

AI: Got it - so you're pretty much navigating AI use independently without much workplace influence either way.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: That's a good question. I can't think of anything experience that I could describe as frustration, however I've been satisfied from a AI outline from a search in google that let me know the process in setting up garbage service for a commercial tenant as the government website was much more unclear on how to do that than the AI outline.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like the AI helped you cut through the bureaucratic complexity to get to the practical steps you actually needed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really factor into how you approach your work?

User: Not really. My job isn't something that's going to be replaced by AI because my boss relies on me for anything technical or involving computers. If anything, I'd be using AI to make my own work processes easier.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - seeing AI more as a tool that reinforces your role rather than threatens it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll start using it more, or do you expect to keep that same selective approach?

User: I can see AI working more as a personal assistant or secretary that would be able to assist me in my role at work. I can see this being more important when I start acquiring my own properties for investment.

AI: That vision of AI as a personal assistant is really compelling, especially as your responsibilities expand with your own property investments.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits differently into established processes versus completely new areas like your Japanese property research.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I can't think of anything that stands out at the moment.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI selectively - particularly that distinction between working within established processes versus exploring new territory - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Can I confirm with you that the interview is finished now.

AI: Yes, absolutely - the interview is now finished. Thank you again for participating!
