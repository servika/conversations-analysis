Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: At work, AI is used in two separate ways. The first way is the company has integrated it into some of the processes we use. Such as Genesys, which is the system we use to make and receive calls. They have integrated AI into listening to the calls. And using pop-ups to direct the customer service reps to various forms or information, it basically just helps decide what you may or may not need to know for that call. In my role I personally, use AI for several tasks. I will use it for everything from a general search on a topic that I need or more and specific information. I have used it with Google maps links to pull longitude and latitude coordinates out of a google map web address, I find it comes in very handy for searching documents quickly and retaining key points. For putting things into point form for me quickly when I am needing to send a text or a quick email.

AI: That's really interesting how you're experiencing AI both through your company's systems and your own direct use. 

Tell me more about that personal use - when you mentioned using AI to search documents and retain key points, what does that process look like for you? How do you actually work with the AI to get what you need?

User: I will upload a document into the AI. then I am able to ask it specific questions for what I may need, could be regarding specific data that may need to be put into an excel sheet, perhaps I need the names of all the people mentioned in said document as that is who I will need to email. Sometimes I will need a shortened version with just the major key points that will be going to a group email, and I want to make sure that it is very clear and easy to understood what information we require to further action their requests.

AI: That sounds like a really efficient workflow you've developed. When you upload that document and start asking it questions - are you typically going back and forth with the AI, refining your questions based on what it gives you? Or do you usually know exactly what you need and can get it in one go?

User: That depends on the task. Most are easily completed with two or three passes. Sometimes, however based on the responses the AI gives me I alter my original goal as what was provided to me helped me to narrow down the best approach.

AI: That's fascinating - so the AI sometimes helps you discover a better approach than what you originally had in mind. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Depending on the depth of the task it is sometimes easier to just open word and create what I need. However I do find myself creating what I need, then running it through AI to see if I prefer any of the suggestions offered

AI: So you're using it almost like a second set of eyes on your own work. That's a really thoughtful approach.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I prefer to collaborate.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration. What does that look like in practice when you're working through a task together?

User: This is my preference because even though AI is an exceptionally amazing tool, I like it to be just that, something that assists or enhances my own work.

AI: That's a really clear way to think about it - AI as an enhancement rather than a replacement. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people generally open about using it, or is it something you keep more to yourself?

User: Truthfully most of my colleagues are not big fans or they use it to do their work for them not as a resource. I find this can produce generic work that lacks the wording or personalization that a human who knows how each person prefers things worded or formatted. But again, an amazing resources to take the human side and the AI and collaborate.

AI: That's really insightful - you've noticed a real difference between how you and your colleagues approach AI. It sounds like you see value in that human touch and personalization that gets lost when AI does all the work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't often become frustrated anymore because I have learned specifically how to word what i'm hoping to achieve If i'm not getting what I need from the AI I have developed a skill set in order to refine my requests detail by detail until I can get what I want. This does not frustrate me at all. I enjoy working like that.

AI: That's really interesting how you've developed that skill of refining your requests. It sounds like you've found a rhythm that works well for you.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes it is something I actively consider. I stand firm in my belief that AI will be able to sustain and deliver what we now as humans can and more. I also stand firm in that only a person can truly know human interaction, feelings, body language, tone and most importantly empathy, what an injustice it would be to lose that and I think the world needs to remember that.

AI: That's a powerful perspective - valuing those uniquely human qualities. It sounds like you see AI and human capabilities as complementary rather than competing.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am on board 100 percent. I am excited and looking forward to working hand in hand with AI. The best of the best together and that right there will deliver what neither side can on their own.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on collaboration over delegation and how you've developed that skill of refining your requests to get exactly what you need.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think you covered it all. Thank you so much.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the importance of maintaining that human element while embracing AI collaboration will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
