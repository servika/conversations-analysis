Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I have no questions as of yet. You may begin.

AI: Great, thank you. Let's start with something broad to get us going.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I currently work for the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Specifically the Brownfields Voluntary Cleanup Program. We do not have instruction to use AI models to assist us with our work, but there aren't any restrictions either. In my typical workday, which I cannot reveal specific information or talk about our processes, I use AI from time to time when we get new BVCP and Brownfields Assessment applications. As these applications need a good bit of detail in order to get information about various sites being implemented into our program, I find it easier to acquire details about the site being applied for. The information I look for revolves around property history information, building ownership, finding contacts to work with, etc. I also will use AI for our outreach coordination. Our coordinator sometimes needs assistance developing presentations for communities, but also for proposals with grants.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI for research and information gathering tasks as well as some content development work.

When you mention using AI to acquire details about sites - like property history and finding contacts - could you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you go about getting that information with AI's help?

User: I can give you a couple of examples. For one, I use AI to attempt to search for financial departments of companies where a site is located or for a company that is working on a site. For example, I might ask a model for the phone number for a financial department at Missouri State University (I cannot share additional details on this) or to simply look up the owner of a building or surrounding buildings. Other pieces of information that I must acquire, but do not actually utilize models for acquiring information such as coordinates, property land size, prior assessments (Phase 1 or Phase 2), knowledge of prior contaminants, etc. Essentially when processing the application, I will simply ask a model about some of the easily acquirable information that an AI might be able to research.

AI: That's a clear distinction you're making between what you'll use AI for versus what you handle yourself. 

I'm curious about that boundary - what makes you decide that certain information like coordinates, property land size, or prior assessments are tasks you prefer to handle yourself rather than asking AI to help with? What's different about those tasks for you?

User: Great questions. So the information that I do not ask, such as coordinates, and property size, is generally more critical in the Environmental Risk Assessment processes. This information is relayed to contractors who do the bulk of the physical workload that my department does not really partake in. With that, because of how important the legal and environmental work is, we have to ensure we use the most reliable sources to acquire the information. Unfortunately, AI that I have used before will give frequently inaccurate information regarding the information I seek. This is most likely due to the fact that information such as property size and exact coordinates is not something easily obtained by a model since the information is generally not public. I also assume this is why the MO state government does not encourage the use of AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - accuracy is crucial when information goes to contractors and has legal or environmental implications. 

When you do use AI for those other tasks like finding contact information or financial departments, how do you typically verify or check that information? Do you have a process for making sure what the AI gives you is reliable before you use it?

User: More fantastic questions. So to verify the information, if it's contact information, I will give a quick call or send out a brief email where I introduce myself and ask if they are a good contact for the upcoming project. For addresses, I honestly don't really verify this a whole lot. I might verify an address by using Google Maps because the address given on an application is wrong and I want to get a visual on the actual location for the site. If I use it to acquire addresses for the vicinity of the site, I generally just use Google Maps to check one or two locations to ensure that it looks generally good. Typically adjacent properties are irrelevant and 1 in maybe 20 sites will actually need the information. However, if the information is incorrect, we will find out and I can go into Google Maps, type in the site address, and simply look in the vicinity for proper addresses then relay it to whomever it concerns. Essentially, a model inaccuracy here is not a big deal.

AI: That's a really practical approach - it sounds like you've developed a good sense of when accuracy matters versus when it's more of a convenience tool where mistakes are easily caught and corrected.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It's a little bit of both. Generally the interactions start off with a quick question. For example, "what can you tell me about [address]? Is there an active business here?" Then if the model gives me information about a company, I might ask what the company does, how long they have been at the location, and a contact number or email. If anything catches my attention and I need to ask more questions, I will, but this type of additional information is something I cannot share.

AI: That gives me a good picture of your interaction style - starting simple and then building on what the AI provides based on what catches your attention.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about it with coworkers, or is it something you've figured out more on your own?

User: This is something I do on my own, but this is because I am the only one in my position that handles applications. After than, the site gets handed off to a project manager who does more of the analytical work, research, and communication. With that, as mentioned before, because the information we handle has legal and environmental implications, my team members are far more hesitant to use AI.

AI: That's interesting that you're working more independently with AI since you're in a unique role. It sounds like the legal and environmental implications create a cautious culture around AI use for your colleagues.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can only give you generalizations with this as detailed information would involve me giving information regarding sites enrolled in the BVCP program that are not yet made public and would require a sunshine request from an outside party in order to acquire it. The example I would give is focused on feeling satisfied (I don't get frustrated at AI but that is just because of my generally calm demeanor). I once asked a model to give me a list of addresses across 4 blocks, the model gave me the list. I checked about 8 or 9 addresses and the model impressed me when it got them all correct. I was able to simply copy and paste the addresses into my document. The feeling was so nice as it saved a decent bit of time.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying moment - when the AI delivered exactly what you needed and you could trust it enough to use the information directly. That time savings must have been significant across 4 blocks worth of addresses.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Can you elaborate on "How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over?"

AI: Sure - I'm curious about whether you think about keeping sharp on tasks that AI might be able to handle. For instance, you mentioned using AI to find contact information or addresses. Do you ever worry about losing your ability to do that research yourself, or is that not something that crosses your mind?

User: Not at all. Being able to do the research myself will always be an option and in most cases I do not see an issue in doing it myself. The information I acquire is also not difficult, but rather slightly convenient. With that, I do not worry because I think that the skills themselves are pretty simple and not something I think anyone would forget. It's a basic skillset.

AI: That makes sense - you're viewing AI more as a convenience tool for basic tasks rather than something that's replacing complex skills you've developed.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll start using it for different types of tasks, or do you see it staying pretty much the same?

User: I do not think that, because of how MO state operates, there will be a time when AI takes a drastic role in what we do in particular. For my job specifically, most definitely not. If AI were to be implemented by the state, and for my department, it would probably be for more analytical type of work such as soil sampling analysis for project managers.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've carved out a practical niche for AI use despite working in a cautious environment - using it as a convenience tool for lower-stakes information gathering while maintaining strict boundaries around critical data.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No. I don't believe there is.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've thoughtfully integrated AI into specific parts of your workflow while maintaining clear boundaries based on accuracy requirements will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
