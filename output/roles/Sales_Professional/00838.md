Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, fire away

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: first and foremost I use AI for standardising CVs, historically that takes up a lot of time with weird fonts and boxes etc, secondly I like to save time with documents, I'll get TL:DRs from things like acronym laden job specs, to a lesser degree I use AI to generate advertising copy for vacancies, but I will typically end up editing or tweaking manually, and I use AI for generating BD copy but again the time spent finessing to remove AI tells is almost not quite worth it atm

AI: Tell me more about that finessing process you mentioned - what are the "AI tells" that you find yourself having to edit out?

User: eh, it's tricky to nail down, typically its sales cliches, or words that AI likes to use like "boasts", "advancements" or "groundbreaking", it's often about the sum of the parts than individual tells and a general "whiff" of artificiality- sorry if that's vague

AI: No, that's actually really helpful - the "whiff of artificiality" is a vivid way to describe it. It sounds like you've developed a pretty keen sense for spotting AI-generated content.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: yeah, I still can't hand the reigns over to a bot for communications that represent ME, and I guess that applies to all avenues of my life, not just work, at the back of my mind it feels disrespectful to the recipient in a way- so if it's an admin/box ticking thing, yeah sure, I'll use a bot- but if I'm expressing something, no, it feels at the back of my mind like its not saying exactly what I want even if its doing a perfectly good job. i don't know if that's me being a luddite, or sentimental, or rightly protective of my own voice. there's a grey area between something like a business development mailer where its going to reach a lot of people and i want it to be something I'm happy to put my name to, and something like an individual email to a long term client that requires my professional opinion, I feel like I owe people in my close circle thoughts directly from my brain rather than bowdlerised by a bot

AI: That distinction between representing yourself versus more administrative tasks really comes through clearly. The idea of owing people in your close circle "thoughts directly from my brain" is particularly striking.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: at the moment, i run a fairly long system prompt that takes care of two elements of the recruitment process, so I have a part of the prompt that looks at chewing through CVs, I have a part of the prompt that generates copy, I typically tend to use the CV processing side of things in the main unless I get a rush of blood to the head and decide to start canvassing new business- yes, I do tend to collaborate but only fine touch tweaks- sometimes I'll see a weird formatting flourish and take it out rather than tell the bot- that's more of a reflection of my impatience and acknowledgement that the bot has already saved me eons of time compared to what I had to deal with as for generating copy we tend to ping and pong between the two of us until I'm happy . none of this takes very long.

AI: That ping-pong process for copy generation sounds interesting. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: hah, my business partner is the definition of an AI skeptic! he's quite small c conservative. that's cool, we are a small partnership and we have complete automomy how we choose to do stuff. he has a lot of strengths I don't have, yin and yang and all that! I prefer to show, not tell, he is certainly curious about how I am managing to suddenly do the job of three admins at the drop of a hat!

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - being able to "do the job of three admins at the drop of a hat" while your partner remains skeptical. It sounds like you're letting the results speak for themselves.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: oh, only a week or so ago. I was given a job description by a very prestigious client, they are great to work with but they love an acronym- if you can make something complex, they do, the actual role was fairly involved as well and it wasn't from a part of the sector we were over familiar with- fed it into the bot, got a bulleted summary. applied this summary to a nice clean directed job vacancy, which brought in a few decent candidates. Since our experience of dealing with these types of candidates is fairly thin, I was able to take suitable CVs, and analyse them for weaknesses using AI. Then, I was able to dilute these concerns into a few targeted questions the candidates could address. This resulted in one candidate in particular returning a set of bulleted refutations of the concerns, including examples of how and why the concerns are addressed. Then I was able to incorporate these BACK into the CV, rewrite the whole thing and tailor it to the role perfectly. Then I got AI to analyse the CV for anything where it might fall down. Then, I got the AI to write a set of refutations about these concerns, and sent them with the CV to the client. Long story short, got an intervew within the hour for a role that we can charge three times as much for, in a role we don't really fully grasp yet, and I'm awaiting the results of the final interview right now!

AI: That's an incredible example - you essentially created this feedback loop between the job spec, candidate analysis, and tailored positioning. It sounds like you orchestrated multiple AI interactions to build expertise in an unfamiliar sector almost in real-time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: yes, I'm often thinking about it, but I have about three decades of mental scar tissue to remove as far as tech is concerned, I've always considered myself a "humanities guy" and ignorantly swanned off, now I'm looking for easily remedied angles where I fall short in an attempt to try and make my understanding of AI start paying dividends- but even understanding the terrain is a bit intimidating, let alone what I need to do within it.

AI: That "three decades of mental scar tissue" phrase really captures something - it sounds like you're simultaneously embracing AI's potential while grappling with a longer history of feeling disconnected from tech.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: "Mental scar tissue" is mostly hyperbole of course, it's fair to say I've felt disconnected from tech as far as the nuts and bolts of it are concerned, but I'm fairly comfortable as a consumer. what I love about AI is it bridges that gap that has built up over the years, it's reactivated dormant skills I thought had sadly consigned to the past, and I feel quite immersed in the future rather than left behind by it. i feel that my next big mission with AI is business development, really partner with it to nail that side of things

AI: That shift from feeling "left behind by the future" to feeling "quite immersed" in it is really powerful. The way you describe AI reactivating dormant skills is fascinating.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on owing people in your close circle "thoughts directly from my brain" - that distinction between personal representation and administrative efficiency really stuck with me.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Social media/Linkedin posts. I know I'm fussy, but I haven't seen anything within a million miles of what I'd want to put my name to. It might be the genre full stop, I don't have any examples to hand, but I really can't see me attempting that again using AI for a while.

AI: That's a really valuable addition - LinkedIn posts seem to hit that same nerve as the personal communications you mentioned earlier. The stakes of putting your name to something that represents you professionally make the bar much higher.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that balance between efficiency gains and maintaining authentic voice, plus that fascinating example of building expertise in real-time through AI collaboration, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
