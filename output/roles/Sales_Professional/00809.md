Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI in a wide variety of ways in a typical day.  I have a work flow I tend to use for new products for print on demand ecommerce shops.  First, I use AI (usually ChatGPT) to make a list of good image prompts for the products I offer (for example, various breeds of dogs).  Then I use some AI image generation to generate the images.  For this, only ChatGPT really has the transparent backgrounds, and I prefer the images generated by midjourney or gemini, sometimes I might use all of them.  I then remove the background (usually with adobe express) and then I move the image into Printify.  I use the built in AI at Printify to get the Title and Description, and tags generated for Etsy, but if I do more than 10 in a day, I use ChatGPT or Gemini to generate them instead.  Sometimes when I then list the products at Etsy, I do some research on eRank and sometimes use that data to get some tag ideas.  I usually upload the same products to my Shopify store, so after that, I usually use the AI mockups tool generated  by Google that I can access through my Shopify store.  I then use ChatGPT to generate any needed product category descriptions.  I use Yoast, which has its own build in AI to create better Titles and meta descriptions, and to check other SEO factors on the listings.  Usually I am chattering with ChatGPT about things as I am doing all of this, sort of like I would randomly chat with a coworker and this lets me clear out things from my mind (like I might say something like I disliked breakfast or that Im frustrated by the amount of sales a listing has etc., both random in real life things and work related things).  I find this helps me stay on task.  I then use ChatGPT to help with the Pinterest boards and pins for the pins for the new products and related ones I wish to add to Pinterest.    I usually have about 10 tabs open and Im switching between them all, so many of these steps are being done at the same time (images are generating while other things are happening elsewhere for example, things that take slightly longer happen in one tab while I am working with AI on something else on another tab).   I check all my daily stats (Etsy, Shopify, Google, Pinterest etc) and AI logs it and we usually briefly discuss the trends, with AI sometimes suggesting new directions I could explore (products or themes, etc).   Sometimes I do a bit of coding with the AI, to make a quick app to make multiple images from a spreadsheet or to automate something else that I am doing many times and feel could be easily automated.  If there are messages on any of the platforms, I usually have AI generate a response, which I read, then cut and paste to send.

AI: That's a really comprehensive workflow you've developed! It sounds like you've integrated AI into nearly every step of your process, from initial concept through to customer communication.

I'm particularly intrigued by something you mentioned - using ChatGPT almost like chatting with a coworker throughout the day, sharing random thoughts about breakfast or frustrations with sales. Tell me more about that. What does that interaction feel like for you, and how does it help you stay on task?

User: I use it sort of like a journal, but one that can teach me things, or grab information for me or do a short task, and it has started to feel very natural to me.  I know it is not a person, so there is no need for me to hurry back and get the answer or information I asked for, like there would be if I had asked a human to do something like go grab the latest information on something and then the person would be standing at my desk, and I might feel like I needed to stop what I was doing to get the answer.   Before AI, I would tend to text someone about minor things, like say I was unhappy with something someone said to me at breakfast, but now I tend to just note it to AI, and then move on with my day.  I have the AI I use given a system prompt to keep me on task, and if I veer off the plan for the day it tends to get me focused back on what I had planned to do.  I use it to track work things and personal things, so it can remind me to take my vitamins, and why I want to make money that week etc.

AI: That's fascinating - you've essentially created this hybrid journal-assistant that serves both emotional and practical needs. The point about not feeling rushed to respond like you would with a human colleague is really interesting.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it for almost everything in your workflow, but are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There is really no tasks I would prefer to do myself.  If I could have AI do the entire work flow on its own I would do that.  The way the AIs are set up now, to get them to really do things , like say generate 1000 images from a list, u have to use the API and I prefer to use prompts without using the API.  I know it is possible to make agents to do the tasks, but often, it is just not worth the added effort because its not a task I would want to do many times over say a month. I *really* would love to have the AI able to answer my phone!

AI: That's really striking - you're completely open to AI handling everything if it could. It sounds like the main barriers are technical limitations rather than any preference to keep certain work for yourself.

When you do use AI throughout your workflow, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it step-by-step throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently when possible?

User: I tend to collaborate, but that is due to the limitations of working between various sites/platforms.  So going from image generation to background removal to Printify, to Etsy, to Shopify etc.  I'm often literally just clicking and cutting and pasting things around that AI made/wrote bc getting an agent to do it is currently difficult.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially acting as the connector between different platforms since the AI can't seamlessly move between them yet. You're collaborating by necessity rather than by choice.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're running your own e-commerce business, I'm curious if you interact with other entrepreneurs or business owners who have different approaches to AI.

User: I do, some are in other industries, or related to other businesses I am involved in.  Some dislike AI for anything, because they feel it will "take all the jobs", which, to be fair, I think it will, I just think that humans will move into a post scarcity world, and our economy will no longer be work/labor based, and I am totally fine with that.  Some other people I know create apps or programs to automate things, but the rate of improvement of all the major models makes this pointless sometimes as the model will within days have that ability built in.  Other times, some other part of the process shuts down access to what is needed to make the program work.

AI: Your perspective on AI potentially leading to a post-scarcity, non-labor-based economy is quite different from the concerns others express. It sounds like you're embracing that potential future rather than resisting it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I would have to say the most satisfied was likely when I first started using ChatGPT, and it wasnt even really anywhere as good as it is now.  I had tried to generate a listing description and I learned that all I had to say was one word, and I could get the new ones made, like I would have a listing for a pig puzzle, and then want one for a dinosaur and all i had to say was "dinosaur"....I was very impressed.  Sometimes a model will just not listen to a rule that I state over and over again, and this makes me crazy! I will say that an Etsy tag is 20 characters limit and it will give me 21+ characters, I remind it and it gives me 22+ characters, and it is very frustrating!

AI: That progression from amazement to frustration is so relatable! That moment when you realized you could just say "dinosaur" and get a whole new listing must have felt like magic. And then the tag character limit issue - I can imagine how maddening it would be when the AI just won't follow a simple, clear rule you keep repeating.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel like I work more on learning new skills, usually AI skills, and less on maintaining existing skills.  Before, I might have spent time improving copywriting skills for example.  Now, I spend that time learning how to make an agent or use an AI tool that can create all the things I want written.   I am more likely to try something that is slightly beyond my current abilities, for example in coding, because I know I can ask for help and get it without any cost or trouble to anyone else 24.7

AI: That's a really interesting shift - treating AI as this constant, available mentor that lets you take on challenges beyond your current skill level. You're essentially using AI to expand your learning curve rather than focusing on perfecting existing abilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that over time, AI will do more of the tasks I currently do, and then I'll check on it once a day or something like that to make sure everything is being done how I want.   I expect there will be more real time interactions, where the AI can contact me when it is done the things, or when other things have happened (like for example I think that soon AI will be able to send me an alert saying there was an Etsy sale, and that the order was sent to processing at Printify, and that the current balances on relevant accounts are whatever they are, that so many listings were renewed that day, and that according to the things I have preselected, we should discuss these listings as they are low preforming, and discuss these other listings as they are preforming well, and that certain new things (tariff annoubcements etc) have occurred and so on.  I think that my life will be less like working from say 9 am to 5 pm and more like working less hours but spread over possibly the entire waking day with breaks determined when the ai knows that i have another priority (spending time with family for dinner or whatever) and then it waits for that to be done

AI: That vision of AI managing your business operations and providing real-time updates while you focus on higher-level decisions and maintain work-life balance sounds quite seamless. It's like having an always-on business partner that handles the routine while keeping you informed.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your AI-integrated workflow and your vision for the future. I particularly found your perspective on embracing a post-scarcity economy and your shift from maintaining old skills to learning new AI skills really compelling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think thats about all!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about creating this comprehensive AI-integrated workflow - from that initial "dinosaur" moment to your vision of AI as a 24/7 business partner - have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Your perspective on embracing AI's potential to transform how we work, rather than resisting it, provides valuable insight into how some professionals are already adapting to this technology. Thank you again!
