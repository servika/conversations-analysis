Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to organize data when possible. My company is pretty behind on integrating AI so it has not been that significant of an aspect in my daily work.

AI: That's interesting that your company hasn't integrated AI much yet. When you say you use it to organize data when possible, can you walk me through what that looks like? What kind of data are you working with, and how do you go about using AI for that?

User: I have to input info from client financial statements into these excel models. A lot of the times the stocks the clients own wont have the tickers so I'll use AI to create a list of the tickers so that I don't have to individually search and input the tickers.

AI: That sounds like a really practical time-saver. When you're working on these ticker lookups, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI to refine the results, or do you typically give it the list of stock names and let it handle the whole task at once?

User: I'll let it handle it all at once. I may have to go back to input more data as there's usually multiple pages of stocks.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to handle the tasks that require more thinking on my own. I try not to be overly dependent on AI as it may hamper with my own learning and development. The more repetitive and mundane tasks such as the one I just talked about are the types of tasks I would give to AI.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach. When you mention tasks that require more thinking - can you give me an example of something you'd keep for yourself? What goes through your mind when you're deciding whether a task falls into that "more thinking" category versus the repetitive category?

User: A tasks such as that would be when I have to do calculations or input excel formulas for the model I'm making.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not much. The workplace culture is more old-schooled so the urgency to integrate AI is very low.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There hasn't been a time like that. The only time I ever use AI is if I'm using it to figure out stock tickers in bulk.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I would gladly allow AI to take over the more repetitive tasks that I do. I want to be able to spend more time critically thinking so I would gladly welcome more AI integration within my job.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it becoming more of a tool that will increase my efficiency.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on wanting to preserve the thinking-heavy tasks while letting AI handle the repetitive ones.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that is all. Thank you for your time.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for efficiency while protecting your learning and development opportunities will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you have a great rest of your day!

User: You as well

AI: Thank you! Take care.
