## Representative Examples

### Example 1: Interview 01124

**SDLC Score**: 13

**Categories**: design, development, deployment, projectManagement, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "A recent project where I used AI involved creating immersive learning for a nation wide veterinary company. Each veterinary location was owner managed but made use of company software, followed common procedural steps with business operations (including training) and worked to meet the business obje..."

2. "First of all, I didn't have to code anything which was excellent because I don't code at the level needed to produce interactive files. AI took care of that for me. It made the learning design process easier and quicker which kept me from getting bogged down in small details that were not central to..."

### Example 2: Interview 01147

**SDLC Score**: 10

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, projectManagement, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I run a production company that has a focus on music, books, video content, and games. Many of our projects cross over into any of these fields, or all of them. For example, I have an artist now who is out that has music videos, that are part of an interconnected world that connects to their music. ..."

2. "That depends on the project. I will use my artist as an example. I am a producer, so I create their music the old-fashioned way, on my motif. From there, I send them the track, they write the lyrics, record and mix (in 1 of 3 studios). This is where AI comes in. I get the music, and listen to it, to..."

### Example 3: Interview 00790

**SDLC Score**: 9

**Categories**: requirements, design, development, deployment, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Currently, I am using AI for a couple of tasks in my day-to-day. I use it to help with copywriting content for website mock-ups, specifically creating placeholder content for FAQs, body copy, event copy and offer copy.  In my role, as a UX/UI designer, I am often redesigning client websites which ar..."

2. "I will feed it parts I need rewritten, for example, I'll give it the new set of instructions on how the copy should align with branding at the beginning of a conversation and then input groups of copy, like the current page heading, intro, section headings and card copy and see how it does. I'll the..."

### Example 4: Interview 01110

**SDLC Score**: 9

**Categories**: design, development, testing, projectManagement, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "My creative work spans the gamut! Some of it is simple as editing, however, my main writing projects typically take the form of a choose-your-own-adventure gamebook. So, essentially it has aspects of a long-form novel while also incorporating simple coding for the sake of branches and managing stats..."

2. "Personally, I incorporate AI a lot when it comes to editing my work—spellcheck and grammar, yes, but it's nice to do some sentiment analysis and summaries so that I can make sure I'm conveying what I intend to. When in my initial drafts, I may also brainstorm with AI in order to flesh out a scene; s..."

### Example 5: Interview 00021

**SDLC Score**: 8

**Categories**: design, development, deployment, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I'm a graphic designer/web designer, with additional skills in web development. I typically work on a wide range of projects from logo design, branding system development, website design, packaging, presentations, motion graphics, and video production. I typically work in a very fast-paced environme..."

2. "The most recent project was designing album artwork that I created by using AI generated images from Adobe Firefly, I then spliced elements from them a bunch of images together to create a cohesive image. I used generative AI to add details that weren't there like flames and light effects, and to fi..."
