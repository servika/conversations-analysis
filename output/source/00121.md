Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Ok sounds good

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI mostly to help me form ideas. For example as a Shared Service Coordinator I have to think of resources and ideas to help child care providers in my county

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a brainstorming partner for your work with childcare providers. 

Tell me more about that process. When you're looking for resources and ideas to help these providers, how do you typically work with AI to develop those ideas?

User: I have a monthly meeting with the childcare providers and sometimes I ask for ideas and speaking points for our meetings. I ask for ideas on how to keep the child care providers aka my alliance members engaged and ideas for resources to provide them that are free

AI: That sounds like a really valuable way to use AI for your role. When you're preparing for these monthly meetings, you're getting help with both the content and the engagement strategies.

Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're asking AI for these meeting ideas? Do you give it specific details about your providers, or do you start more broadly?

User: I more so start broadly and then get a little specific. For Example I will say I am planning for my alliance meeting and need help forming ideas. What ideas and points are good to point out and common struggles child care providers face? Then I can ask for ideas and free resources that can help with exact struggles specific providers are facing

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - starting broad and then drilling down to address specific challenges your providers are dealing with.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I do like tracker excel spreadsheets a lot by myself. I'm not sure can AI help with that?

AI: You mentioned you like doing Excel tracker spreadsheets yourself - what is it about working on those that you prefer to handle personally?

User: No I don't necessarily like doing the excel sheets I would rather have AI help me because it's repetitive and time consuming

AI: Ah, I see - so the Excel work is something you'd actually welcome AI help with because of how repetitive and time-consuming it is. That makes sense.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I more so collaborate

AI: Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like in practice? Maybe walk me through how you and AI worked together on a recent task?

User: I mostly give AI a problem I am facing and look for it to help me with a solution. Brainstorming ideas for my providers. I ask for ideas and use that to work with

AI: So you're using AI as a thought partner - presenting the challenge and then taking those brainstormed ideas to build from. That's a nice collaborative flow.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at your organization use it similarly, or is this something you've developed on your own?

User: I am more so one of the only people that use AI. No one really uses it, because they aren't really familiar and have older ways of thinking. I developed this on my own

AI: That's really interesting that you're pioneering AI use in your workplace while others stick to more traditional approaches. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI made me feel satisfied when it helped me create an agenda for my meeting for my child care providers. I was really busy that day doing other tasks.

AI: That sounds like AI really came through for you when you needed it most - taking care of the agenda creation while you handled other urgent tasks.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I will always maintain my skills and not solely rely on AI

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I feel that maybe I can show others how AI can help at work

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being a pioneer in your workplace and how you see yourself potentially helping others discover AI's benefits.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thank you :)

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a brainstorming partner for supporting childcare providers, and especially your role as an early adopter in a more traditional workplace, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
