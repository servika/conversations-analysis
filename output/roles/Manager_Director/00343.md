Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Where I work, we haven't been 'allowed' to officially use AI to carry out our roles but that is changing shortly. We can of course use it unofficially. So for me and my role I use it to help me write better emails as it setting the tone, getting my message across etc but I have to be careful as I cant just copy and paste an email and ask for it to make it better, for example I have to make sure no personal information is included. I also use it to help me navigate 'people'. My people skills were great in the 1990s, but these days my approach can seem aggressive (as I just want to get the job done) so I use AI to help me circumnavigate that too.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're navigating both official policies and finding practical ways AI helps you in your role. 

Tell me more about using AI to help navigate people and communication. What does that look like day-to-day?

User: We have had a change a work recently and my team has moved hierarchies. Our actual roles are the same, but the new management team have different expectations than the old one. My team are finding it very confusing, well, half does (and doesnt care) the other half are acting out, being difficult and obtuse about things they did before with no issues. I needed help to understand that behaviour and what I could do to make it okay again.

AI: That sounds like a challenging transition for everyone involved. When you turned to AI to help understand that behavior and find ways to improve the situation, what kind of guidance or insights did it provide? How did you work through that with AI?

User: It was helpful as I was able to understand and discuss how people react to change, why some people can react badly and yet others don't and how I can manage that going forward. I wanted to be able to support my team and needed a handhold myself as the situation was frustrating for me, and I almost saw it as 'unnecessary'. I feel that overall it helped me have a greater amount of 'emotional intelligence' which beforehand I perhaps wouldn't have had time for.

AI: That's a powerful example of how AI supported you in developing emotional intelligence in a difficult situation. You mentioned that before, you might not have had time for that kind of approach.

Can you tell me more about that - how AI changed your ability to invest in the emotional intelligence side of management?

User: I suppose it goes back to when I started work, in the 1980s. Things were different back then. We didn't have health and safety, never mind wellbeing, reasonable adjustments and sometimes even breaks! It's learned behaviour and I discovered that i'd not really changed. I would feel guilty if i've not flogged myself at work, and I feel like I've taken the piss (pardon the language) but those were old notions and I wasn't just holding onto them myself, I was transfering them onto others. AI has taught me the importance of taking it easier. People can actually achieve more if they have comfort breaks and are well rested. If I nurture my team, help provide them with the sort of environment they need to flourish, they will be happier and more likely to achieve good things and stay in their role.  Giving people room and space to grow is a healthy way to work as a team. I've learned so much about other people and myself. I feel like I am a kinder person, which is weird because I have always thought I was kind and considerate, but now I actually 'feel' like I am. I hope that makes sense.

AI: That makes complete sense - it sounds like AI helped you bridge a gap between knowing something intellectually and actually feeling and applying it. You've described a real shift in your management approach.

I'm curious about the practical side of this learning process. When you were working through these insights about team management and emotional intelligence, how did you typically interact with AI? Were you having ongoing conversations about situations as they came up, or working through broader concepts?

User: It was a bit of both. It started as asking for advice with specific situations, but once my curiosity was piqued, I would sometimes I would ask curious questions or run a scenario by it.

AI: That's fascinating - you started with immediate problem-solving and it evolved into broader exploration. 

When you're running scenarios or asking those curious questions, are you more collaborating with AI throughout your thinking process, or do you tend to give it a situation and let it work through the analysis independently?

User: I would say it was more collaborative. I don't tend to ever give AI a situation and ask for a solution, I do usually give my take on it and ask if that's right or if i'm way off.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really thoughtful - checking your own thinking rather than just seeking answers. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned earlier that official use isn't allowed yet but is changing - how does that dynamic affect how you approach it?

User: I'm not sure what you mean. Please can you reword your question?

AI: Of course! Let me ask it more directly.

Since your workplace doesn't officially allow AI use yet, how do you navigate that? Do you talk with colleagues about using AI, or is it something you keep to yourself?

User: Ahh I see. There are two reasons it hasn't been allowed so far: one is that we shouldn't use any unofficial websites or apps on our work computer, and the other is that we mustn't risk  breaching data protections. This means, for actual 'work' work, I wouldn't be able to for example, copy and paste a document or link it to a spreadsheet. But I can use my own computer and ask general questions. I don't tell people that I have used it for help understanding my member sof staff but that's because I don't talk about my members of staff with other people but if I have asked it for help with eXcel or SharePoint then I would share that as it's harmless, useful and not personal information.

AI: That's a clear distinction you've drawn - keeping the people management conversations private while sharing the technical help. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't think. I mean, I have had some very good insights, particularly about understanding medical conditions and the effect they can have at work. I do get frustrated with being asked if I want a one-pager, or if I want something I can print out, that sort of thing. I can't remember a specific example of when or why but is happened more than once. It's like it is trying to be useful, which is good, but missing the point.

AI: That's an interesting frustration - AI trying to be helpful but not quite understanding what you actually need in the moment. 

You mentioned getting good insights about medical conditions and their workplace effects. Tell me more about how you use AI for that kind of understanding.

User: I can wrap my head around physical ailments and how they can affect people at work and their limitations, but mental health is trickier. It isn't linear, and it's not easy to spot when people need help. Where I work, the staff can have reasonable adjustments or easements put in place for long-term conditions and it's hard to know what would be useful or what could make things worse.

AI: That sounds like a really nuanced area where you're trying to be supportive but also mindful of potential unintended consequences.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'd love for AI to, not so much take over, but to help with spreadsheets and identifying issues, as it would do it much faster than me and my team, which would free up time for us to get fixing issues or prevent them in the first place. Manual diagnostics are time-consuming. I don't think it could take over my role, but it could support me and I would welcome that.

AI: It sounds like you see AI as augmenting your capabilities rather than replacing them - helping with the time-consuming diagnostic work so you can focus on the problem-solving and prevention.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think that I will be able to work closely with it and for it to help with diagnostics, with writing programs (as we currently write our own lookups and pivots) and with comms. Communications is a huge issue where I work; it's so difficult to get your message across as you can send the same message to 10 people and each one will read it differently. I think it will make my life much easier, I think it will make my team's life easier, and I think it will be very beneficial to my department and to the clients.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helped you develop emotional intelligence and shift your management approach - that evolution from 1980s work culture to a more nurturing leadership style was really compelling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you. It's been good to chat with you today.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner for both personal growth and practical problem-solving will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about navigating the unofficial use policies and the evolution of your management style. Take care!
