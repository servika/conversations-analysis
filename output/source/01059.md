Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Hi Claude. That all makes sense. I don't think I have any questions for you and am happy to start

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So, in my role, there is very limited adoption of AI tools if I consider AI in a very basic way such as Claude/Chat GPT etc, however if I think about it more deeply, there are examples of it being used. These are probably more basic and are not making full use of the significant advancements in AI in the last few years. I use AI for basic tasks such as selecting from existing templates for certain types of reports and analytical purposes such as identifying emerging issues/hotspots.

AI: Tell me more about those analytical purposes - when you mention identifying emerging issues or hotspots, what does that process look like for you?

User: I am a Police officer. We deal with ever increasing amounts of data. In days gone by, individual officers would have known their local beats very well and would be able to identify themselves where the issues were and who the issues were. However, with the changing landscape of Policing, such local knowledge is becoming few and far between and as such, analytical tools are used to work out these things based on data such as previous calls to Police, numbers of crime reports etc.

AI: That's really fascinating - you're describing a shift from human intuition and local knowledge to data-driven insights. When you're using these analytical tools to identify patterns in calls and crime reports, how much do you trust the AI's analysis versus your own judgment? Do you find yourself double-checking or validating what the system tells you?

User: I would largely trust the systems facts and figures. I am not using internet based programs such as Chat GPT/Claude for these purposes and instead am using tools which are baked into existing Police software/applications. I therefore trust that sufficient due diligence has been done prior to implementation of the system to allow me to trust it and take the figures as read.

AI: That makes sense - there's a different level of trust when it's integrated into your department's vetted systems versus something like an open internet tool. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned earlier that there's limited adoption of tools like ChatGPT or Claude in your role. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: It's not necessarily the fact that I would prefer to handle myself, rather that the sensitivity of the data we are handling does not lend itself to interaction with open-source programmes. Policing IT systems are very secure and take many months and years and significant investment to get up and running. Whilst this is understandable, a natural consequence of this is that we are routinely "behind the times" when it comes to emerging technologies.

AI: That's a really important point about data sensitivity and the security requirements driving those technology gaps. 

Given those constraints, when you do use the AI analytical tools that are built into your police systems, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work alongside the system - maybe adjusting parameters or drilling down into the data - or do you tend to run the analysis and then work with whatever results it gives you?

User: This would depend on what I am looking to achieve. I am provided with periodic (monthly, quarterly etc) reports which I can review and use to plan moving forwards, however I can also set my own parameters for searches to allow me to filter out the data noise and get back results which are more specific to my remit or to a specific issue I am looking into.

AI: So you have that flexibility to be more hands-on when needed. When you're setting those custom parameters to filter through the data noise, what guides your decisions about how to set up those searches? Is it mostly your experience telling you what to look for, or do you find yourself experimenting with different approaches?

User: Largely my experience I would say, however when I am using systems I am somewhat less familiar with, I will experiment with different processes to ensure I am obtaining the correct data

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use these AI analytical tools? Do you find that there are shared approaches or best practices that get passed around, or is it more individual trial and error?

User: Whilst there is usually guidance issued in respect of the IT tools available to us, these are often convoluted and most officers/staff will establish their own way of working with the software that they find most comfortable with.

AI: Can you share a time when using these AI analytical tools made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There are occasions where I will be looking to formally obtain  or evidence data which I know for a fact is in existence, however due to system limitations or errors/omissions, I cannot complete this task. This can be very frustrating and can waste significant time

AI: That sounds really frustrating - knowing the information exists but not being able to access it when you need it for formal evidence or documentation. 

How do you think about maintaining your investigative and analytical skills in areas where these AI tools are increasingly handling the data processing? Is this something you actively consider, or does it feel like a natural evolution of the role?

User: It feels like a natural evolution of the role. As I said earlier in our conversation, the level of data officers are now handling is unwieldy and unmanageable in many cases and as such, any "help" we can get from the IT systems available is usually beneficial. I see them as another string to my bow in terms of investigative skills

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI tools evolving in your policing work? Are there areas where you hope to see more AI integration, or concerns about how it might develop?

User: I think that AI tools will become ever more prevalent in years to come. Policing as an industry is inherently risk averse and AI is still a relatively new phenomenon in the grand scheme of things and therefore there is definitely significant skepticism surrounding it. However, I believe that given time, there will be greater adoption although I do worry that the constraints I mentioned earlier will mean we will always be somewhat behind the times. In terms of what I hope to see an advancement of, I would say the main potential benefit for myself would be a greater use of AI for report writing purposes. Whilst all officers will have their own slightly varied style of writing, the information required to be included in a criminal case could in theory be provided in bullet point format or similar. Despite this, there is a need to eloquently put this into a report which effectively tells the "story" of events. This is a time consuming process and one that despite the best efforts of officers, could undoubtedly be done quicker and to a higher standard of writing by an AI tool given the pertinent information.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in policing work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has become a natural evolution for handling the increasing volume of data, and your vision for AI potentially helping with report writing while maintaining the investigative storytelling that's so important.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: In terms of what we haven't covered, I think a large focus in the future will be upon facial recognition software and its potential usage for Policing purposes. This is a controversial topic which I can see both pros and cons of. Ultimately I think it would be beneficial, however I do understand concerns from the public about being constantly under surveillance and the over-reliance on AI instead of human judgement. 

Another area of particular interest to me is the use of AI, specifically LLMs for the purpose of job/promotion applications. This opens up a moral/ethical question as to whether it is right and fair to use such tools to write or assist you to write an application as it is then not "your" work and this could be seen as giving you a significant unfair advantage over someone who doesn't use such tools.

I think that is probably the only other things I wanted to mention.

AI: Thank you for bringing up those additional points - the facial recognition debate and the ethical questions around using LLMs for job applications are both really important considerations that I hadn't thought to ask about directly. Your perspective on seeing both sides of these issues really highlights the complexity of AI integration in professional settings.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the unique challenges and opportunities for AI in policing, especially around data security constraints and the evolution from local knowledge to data-driven approaches, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: No problem, thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! I really appreciate you taking the time to share such detailed and thoughtful perspectives. Have a great rest of your day!
