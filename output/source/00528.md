Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. No questions!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure! I'm a math instructor at a private after-school program for grades 2-5. In my current job, I usually use AI to help me develop engaging hooks, real-world connections, and examples to explain math concepts as a part of my lesson plans.  I also use it for advice on classroom management and behavior issues. Lately, I've been onboarding onto this new job, so I use AI for ideas and advice on how best to format my classes, how to communicate with my supervisors on pay, etc. One important way I use AI in my typical workday is that I use voice dictation on my commute home every day to write a "work journal entry" that the AI then rewrites into a cohesive summary and helps me list out highlights of the day, concerns, and action items for the next day.

AI: That's a really comprehensive way you're integrating AI into your work! The voice dictation journal on your commute is particularly interesting - that sounds like it helps you process your day while turning travel time into productive reflection.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle creating my lesson plans myself, even though AI could do it. I have previously tried to use AI to help me create lesson plans from scratch, but they have lots of weaknesses when it comes to this. Therefore, I create the lesson plan myself, using AI to help me answer specific questions I have in the process. Another task I do myself rather than delegating to AI is working through my students' problem sets myself. (The students work out of workbooks that I do not write, so I often work through the workbook pages myself to get answer keys and understand what they need to be taught.) I have been tempted to take pictures of the workbook pages and upload them to AI and have them solve them, but it's important for me to go through the process of doing the problems myself so that I can understand exactly the thought process my students are going through, common mistakes they might make, patterns they should recognize, etc. Another task I have been thinking about using AI for but so far doing myself is tracking my weekly hours and expected pay. I am just not sure how to set AI up for doing a task like that and would rather do it myself to make sure nothing gets lost in translation.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've identified tasks where the process itself is as valuable as the outcome. Working through those problems yourself to understand your students' thinking process makes a lot of sense from a teaching perspective.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate with AI throughout a task rather than delegating complete tasks for it to handle independently. I usually ask AI one-off questions as I'm working through a task.

AI: That collaboration approach seems to fit well with how you described using it for lesson planning - getting specific help as questions come up rather than handing over the whole process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: At my previous job, my co-workers were very open with each other about using AI to help them develop lesson plans. At that job (I was a STEM summer camp instructor for grades 2-6), no lesson plans were provided, so we all had to develop curriculum from scratch.

AI: Tell me more about that - how did that openness around AI use at your previous job play out? Did you learn new ways to use it from your colleagues or change how you approached it?

User: The openness around AI use at my previous job encouraged me to also lean into my use of AI to help me develop as a teacher. Since I was (and still am) quite entry-level, working in summer camp and after school settings and just getting my feet wet, AI has been a really valuable resource in helping me "learn" to be a teacher.
To answer your question, I don't think I necessarily learned new ways to use it from my colleagues or changed how I used it - we used it in pretty similar ways.

AI: That's really interesting - AI as a teaching mentor of sorts, especially when you're developing your skills in the profession. It sounds like it's been a valuable support system during this learning phase.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure! I guess the best example I can think of is with my work journal voice entries. The first time I tried it out, I was very satisfied with the results. Using voice dictation, I had spoken at length about my work day in stream-of-consciousness style, with lots of bouncing around topics, losing my train of thought, non-sequiturs, and stammers/ums/uhs. The AI was able to take this very long prompt and give me a very organized, succinct, clear journal entry that exactly reflected my thoughts and feelings from the day. It honestly made me understand my own thoughts and feelings better after seeing everything re-written into clear, logical sentences. It was able to give me an accurate list of action items, which made me feel organized and in control. I was very satisfied with being able to use AI in this way.

AI: That sounds like a really powerful experience - having AI help you process and understand your own thoughts more clearly. It's fascinating that it helped you gain insight into your own thinking patterns.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do see lots of headlines about AI threatening job security, but I don't give it much active thought, maybe (naively) because I just can't think of substantial ways that AI can replace teaching, at least in the near future. At most, I try to use AI in my daily life just so that I feel comfortable using it and am "AI-literate" for the sake of employability.

AI: That perspective makes sense - teaching does seem like it requires that human connection and real-time responsiveness that would be hard to replicate. The focus on staying AI-literate for general employability sounds practical.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see my use of AI at work expanding in the future. There are probably (definitely) ways to use AI to make my work better/easier/smoother that I haven't thought of yet.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a collaborative partner rather than for complete task delegation, and that powerful example of how the voice journal helped you understand your own thoughts more clearly.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a learning support while you develop as a teacher, and how you've found that balance between collaboration and maintaining the human elements that are essential to teaching, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
