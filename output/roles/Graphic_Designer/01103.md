Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No I don't, we can begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in. 

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do a lot of creative work as a graphic designer and I also work as a consultant for a technology firm as a generative AI expert. For my creative work, I often will use AI to help me get started with ideas for creative projects. For example I am currently working on a faux newspaper design for a client. I used AI to help me understand what makes a newspaper look like a newspaper, since I am not familiar with that sort of design. Also I will use AI to help me when I need to learn a new technique withing Adobe Creative Suite, such as how to use a tool. For my AI consulting work, I will use AI to analyze massive amounts of data and extract insights. For example, I recently did an analysis of 70+ video sales call transcripts and asked the AI for areas where the company founder could improve his sales techniques. These are just a couple examples, there are many more.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across quite a range of tasks in both roles. 

Tell me more about that newspaper project. When you say you used AI to understand what makes a newspaper look like a newspaper, what did that interaction look like? How did you work with the AI to get that understanding?

User: I already have a design assistant set up, so it knows the work I do. So, I started a new project within the AI tool, and then I asked it for some characteristics of a newspaper front page. Subsequently I was still finding that my design didn't look like a newspaper, so I uploaded a screenshot, and it immediately identified some issues, such as, I needed to use full justification on my paragraphs, and I needed to try tighter line spacing and add in an additional column. Screenshots have been invaluable, as I continue to work on this project I have sent the AI screenshots and asked for improvements.

AI: That back-and-forth process with screenshots sounds really dynamic. When you're working like that - uploading screenshots and getting feedback - does it feel more like you're collaborating with a design partner, or is it more like you're asking for specific help and then going off to implement it on your own?

User: As a designer of 25 years experience myself, I view it more as a reference, a consultant, a colleague, someone I'll get some ideas from and then I head off to work on my own for a while.

AI: That's a helpful distinction. Given your 25 years of experience, I'm curious - are there certain tasks or aspects of your design work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Actual design needs to be handled by me. The AI is not good at thinking creatively or originally, so I need to handle all creative thought. That said, I have gotten some good creative ideas from the AI assistant. But anything with soul or humanity needs to be handled myself. Implementation needs to be handled myself.

AI: That's a compelling way to put it - tasks with "soul or humanity." Can you give me an example of what that looks like in practice? What would be a specific moment or type of decision where you recognize that human touch is essential?

User: I do a lot of logo design. Logos generally need to be unique and clever. There are often creative and clever ways to design a logo that only a human eye can find, a human designer. I have never seen an AI assistant successfully come up with a creative and clever logo design. Yes, it could create something generic, something based on the massive amount of information it has consumed, something which might look good, but this will not be original or clever... it will be derivative.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the originality and cleverness that comes from human insight versus something that's well-executed but derivative. 

Switching gears a bit to your consulting work - when you're analyzing those 70+ sales call transcripts, how does that process typically unfold? Are you working alongside the AI throughout that analysis, or do you tend to hand it off and then work with what it gives you back?

User: In this sort of project I am leaning much more heavily on the AI. For this consulting work, I am often working with fields where I have little direct knowledge. Like the sales call analysis for example, I am not a salesperson, so I needed the AI to both analyze the data and come up with a report and next steps. To be clearer, we always record our meetings with an AI notetaking service. We then download the meeting transcripts, in this case going back about 6 months, then I added all those into an AI which allowed that large of an amount of files to be added to a conversation. Then I told the AI what our problem was and what I needed it to do. I asked for a detailed report, then I read the report and highlighted the areas which made sense to implement and I sent the report to the company founder.

AI: That's fascinating how your approach shifts so dramatically between the two types of work. In that consulting scenario, it sounds like the AI is doing much more of the heavy lifting - analyzing, synthesizing, and even generating recommendations.

When you're working in that mode where you have less direct expertise in the field, how do you evaluate whether the AI's analysis and recommendations make sense? What's your process for deciding which parts to highlight as worth implementing?

User: I view this sort of research and analysis and taking my abilities, resources, and time, and multiplying them by 10x. Since I am familiar with the company that this report was generated for, I could identify which things did not apply, and I also could see areas where my gut told me we needed to improve, but seeing the assistant identify those areas as well helps create clarity, and it also helps the stakeholders to know that it's not just my opinion. Going back to the 10x thing, that means that I am not completely ignorant, I still need to take an interest in the work that I am going, even if that means doing research and learning about the field we are working in, or learning about the company we are working with. But, it means that I can multiply time and power by leveraging AI.

AI: That 10x multiplier is a powerful way to think about it - expanding your capacity while still maintaining that human judgment about what applies and what doesn't. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself adjusting your approach based on the environment you're in?

User: We have totally embraced using AI in our work. The challenge has been making sure that everyone understands that we need to use it as a tool, and not using it to create soul-less or sloppy work, just to get it done. For example, creating content for our emails or website. We need to use the AI assistant for ideas, outlines, first drafts, or to analyze our writing for improvements, but we cannot let it do our work for us. If we let it do our writing then we lose our soul and personality. AI has completely revolutionized our approach to all work. I would say it is in the same category as the beginning of the internet/websites and social media, as far as how much it has transformed our business and work flow.

AI: That comparison to the early internet and social media really puts it in perspective - that level of transformation is significant. 

Can you share a specific time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I know there have been times were I did get really frustrated with using AI, it does happen fairly often, but I can't think of an example. But when it comes to feeling satisfied, I have to say that when the AI helps me to do something I would not otherwise have ever done, it is a very satisfying feeling. I suffer from a lot of writing block, so using it to help me get started on a website article or content for a webpage is a huge help. Also, I love use deep research tools to help me dive into new directions for business or analyzing creative ideas. These are things that would have taken me weeks previously that now I can have a detailed report on the feasibility of an idea I have within minutes. Maybe one example... I have been starting a rebrand of one of my businesses, and I had a deep research report created about my potential brand name, logo, core values, and looking at who else in this space had gone down this road, or niche. Turns out the way was clear to proceed, and we did... with caution of course... trust but verify.

AI: That writing block example really resonates - using AI to get past that initial hurdle rather than staring at a blank page. And that rebrand research sounds like exactly the kind of deep dive that would have been prohibitively time-consuming before.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My feeling is that my skills are so specialized that I don't worry about AI taking my work away from me. Rather, I think about how I can embrace it and use it. So, say that AI design becomes really excellent, and it can create a decent logo concept. For the foreseeable future I will still be needed to create the ideas that we feed to the AI designer, and then I will still need to create the high quality assets that are provided to the client. I just don't think I need to worry about my type of high end clients using AI for what I do.

AI: That confidence in your specialized expertise and high-end client base is really interesting. It sounds like you see yourself staying at the strategic and quality control levels even as AI capabilities expand.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think this is all heading for you?

User: I feel like there was a period of about 1 year where there was a lot of hype and excitement about AI making our work and lives easier. This is still true but I feel like we have quickly become very attuned to the difference between AI generated content and human generated content. I think the next phase is using AI as an assistant, a researcher, someone to handle menial tasks, etc. I feel like I am at a bit of a plateau right now with AI usage... in that I am not entirely sure what the next big thing is. I think the pendulum swung far to one side, over using AI, and now we are letting it swing the other way, and it will settle in the middle. Smart AI use is key. One area which I suppose I know we need to look into more, as part of our consultancy, is fully independent AI agents. Realistically that is something that we need to work with.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI acts as that 10x multiplier for your capabilities while you maintain the creative judgment and "soul" of the work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think I have shared all I need to share, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and maintaining the human elements that define quality work have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
