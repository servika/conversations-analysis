Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, thank you.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for multiple administrative tasks. I primarily use AI to generate email communication to external business contacts, generate agendas, and write descriptive directions when given a summary of a project I need to delegate.

AI: That's helpful context. When you're using AI for these administrative tasks - like generating emails or writing project directions - can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: When I have an email that I want to send I take two approaches. Sometimes I will draft the email and ask AI to refine, rewrite or correct any errors. I use this approach a lot for more sensitive topics that may need to incororate private infomation that I do not want to provide to the AI. The second approach I use is to give AI parameters on what I am looking for. For example," write me a friendly but direct response to [REDACTED] following up on my previous email  on 8/1 regarding his outstanding balance. Please be brief."

AI: That's a really interesting distinction you make between those two approaches. When you're deciding which approach to take - drafting first versus giving parameters - what goes through your mind? What helps you decide which route to go?

User: If I am communicating about highly sensitive or complicated information I generally do not want to input that into AI. If it requires a high level of personalization I will write a draft with place holders for private information. I find this works better than providing information that may not make sense without greater context and leaves less room for the AI to get creative and go off the rails.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're being strategic about what information you share and maintaining control over sensitive details. 

Tell me more about what you mean when you say the AI might "get creative and go off the rails." What does that look like when it happens?

User: I do not want the AI to editorialize or offer suggests. Perhaps on a medication change I am communicating about, while there may or may not be appropriate considerations that is not something that AI should be utilized for in my role.

AI: I see - you need to maintain professional boundaries around what the AI contributes to your communications, especially in areas where expertise and judgment are critical.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Generally, I try to use AI anywhere I can. I will only choose not to if it is an arena that requires expertise or I have had unsuccessful attempts in the past.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned unsuccessful attempts in the past. Can you tell me more about what those looked like? What happened that made you decide AI wasn't the right fit for those particular tasks?

User: I have found sometimes when doing in depth research the AI can get off track and include too much information that requires me to sift through the valuable parts and fact check too much. If the topic is not well known I feel like it becomes an extra step to verify the validity of the information.

AI: That really highlights the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. When you're working through those research tasks where AI gets off track, how do you typically handle that? Do you find yourself going back to doing the research entirely yourself, or have you found ways to work around those limitations?

User: I have had to go back and research independently.  I know that AI cannot be trusted all of the time, but many people do not.

AI: That's a really important observation - you mention that many people don't realize AI can't be trusted all the time. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would say its about 80 percent collaboration and 20 percent delegation.

AI: That's a clear split. When you think about that 20 percent where you're delegating complete tasks, what makes those tasks suitable for full delegation? What's different about those compared to the ones where you collaborate throughout?

User: I have certain tasks that are reoccuring, I am fairly familiar with the data. I am confident in having AI complete tasks like that.  I am happy to have AI retrieve data points from a file I provide, summarize it,  make lists. This is an area I will fully delegate

AI: That makes sense - you've built confidence through repetition and familiarity with the data. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that played a role in how you approach these tools?

User: No, I work fairly independently. A lot of my contacts are older and hesitant to use AI.

AI: It sounds like you're somewhat of an early adopter in your environment. Since you work fairly independently, how did you develop your approach to using AI? Was it mostly through trial and error, or did you have other influences guiding how you learned to use it effectively?

User: It was curiosity! I am all about working smarter not harder. Rather than fearing AI I want to embrace it and use it to enhance my productivity.

AI: I love that perspective - embracing it rather than fearing it. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I am assigned tasks and there are weeks when I have a much heavier workload. When I am able to use AI to delegate certain tasks and finish all I need to it is very satisfying. Prior to using AI tools I spent a lot more time on basic tasks.

AI: That sounds like a real game-changer for managing those heavy workload periods. When you look at those basic tasks that used to take so much time, how much time would you estimate AI has freed up for you? And what do you find yourself doing with that extra time?

User: It is hard to quantify how much time but I am not working as much outside my contracted hours.

AI: That's a meaningful improvement - maintaining better work-life boundaries. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I like to think of AI as my assistant, not my replacement.

AI: That's a nice way to frame it. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular ways?

User: I believe as AI evolves I will continue to learn the best methods to utilize it both professionally and personally. I hope accuracy will continue to improve and also the natural language will improve.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI as an assistant rather than a replacement, and how you've developed that strategic approach to deciding when to collaborate versus delegate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working smarter not harder, the importance of maintaining professional boundaries with sensitive information, and how AI has helped you achieve better work-life balance will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
