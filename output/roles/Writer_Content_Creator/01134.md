Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. Let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a science fiction novelist. Most of my series have involved time travel, but the current one is a bit of a departure. It's a four-book series set in the late 21st century, and partially takes place on a Mars that is in the final stages of terraforming. My academic background is more historical and political than scientific, so I frequently have biology questions, and sometimes need to know things like how far it is from one geographic point on Mars to another.

AI: That sounds fascinating - a terraforming Mars setting must require a lot of world-building research. I can imagine those biology and geography questions come up quite a bit when you're trying to make that world feel authentic.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Any time I have a question that requires me to use advanced math. :)  I've also used AI to help come up with some basic rules for a language. Occasionally, I use AI as an advanced thesaurus when I can't come up with the right word.  Or when I need to figure out how much a knish might cost at a food truck in 2090 given typical rates of inflation. Stuff like that.

AI: Those are some really practical and specific uses! I love the knish pricing example - that's such a concrete detail that probably helps make your future world feel real and lived-in.

Can you describe a specific recent project or moment where you used AI? What role did it play in that instance, and how did that feel for you as a writer?

User: I needed to figure out whether the process of growing lab meat and the quality of the final product would be affected by the lower gravity on Mars.

AI: That's such a specific and technical question! Tell me more about that - how did you approach getting that answer, and what was it like working through that problem with AI?

User: I simply asked what the differences might be and was then given a list of changes. One of my beta readers is a biologist, and I usually run these things past her, but she was away from the computer. When I spoke with her later, she said that the response was well-reasoned and lower gravity would probably have many of those effects. I like being able to get a general idea on topics like this before I run them past beta readers and other specialists I know, because it saves them time I have my ducks in a row before I contact them. I was less happy with some of the creative suggests for a generic name for lab meat, but I can usually come up with those on my own.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a kind of first-pass research tool to get oriented before you consult your human experts. That seems like a smart workflow.

When you're working with AI in these situations, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions in your writing process?

User: Oh, I'm definitely in the driver's seat. It wouldn't work for me if I ever felt that AI was anything other than a productivity tool. My writing style is commonly known as "pantser" as in "flying by the seat of your pants." If things are mapped out too carefully, I lose interest in writing that story. Why finish it if you already know everything about how the story ends? :)  So, I wouldn't be including to use AI for plotting or outlining -- I don't do much of that. And it's worked for 27 books, so I'm not going to tamper with it.

AI: That's a great insight - it sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI handles the technical research questions that support your world-building, but stays completely out of the creative storytelling process that drives your passion for writing.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has it shifted how you approach certain parts of your process?

User: One odd thing that I've done from time to time is to write a scene in first person present (which is my strength), then let AI shift it over to 3rd person past. This is the first series that I've written in that tense and POV. It doesn't come easily to me, but this is a slightly different genre than I've written in before, and first person present isn't the norm. I won't make this mistake again, but I've got to finish this last book before I can get back to what I like best. Writing in a way that flows for me and then having AI take the first pass at shifting it to the other style actually saves me a good bit of time because I stay in the flow.

AI: That's such a clever workaround! It sounds like you found a way to let AI handle the mechanical translation between tenses and POVs while you stay in your creative flow state. 

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field or in creative work more broadly?

User: I've got a lot of concerns.  I used to be traditionally published, but royalties dropped and they were no longer worth the tradeoff against the creative control that I retain by self-publishing. Unfortunately, its really easy to self-publish--and a book doesn't have to be good to earn money. There are people out there using AI to crank out massive numbers of derivative books each year using systems that were trained on many books, including my own. They can produce hundreds, maybe even thousands, of bad knockoffs in the time that it takes me to write a single book. Even if the quality is low, there are ways to game the system so that you make decent money on Amazon -- and that screws up the algorithm, resulting in lower royalties for many authors who are producing high quality, original work. I love the idea of AI as a research and editing assistant -- it helps me to get more of my books to my base of readers by reducing the time I spend on those tasks. But it's a very slippery slope, and writers (including me) are worried that flooding the market with derivative AI content is going to make it harder to earn a living and much, much harder for the next generation of creatives to break through.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - you're experiencing both the benefits of AI as a productivity tool and the very real concerns about market saturation and economic impact. It sounds like there's a meaningful distinction for you between using AI to enhance your own creative process versus using it to generate content wholesale.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your current approach will change?

User: For me, AI is a useful tool to handle tasks that I'd either do myself or else have to pay for another round of editing/proofreading. I write in the middle of the night, so having AI to answer a question that is stumping me is far better than waiting a week for someone to get back to me. It's possible that I'll find a few other tasks where AI works for me, but overall, I think it will remain largely the same.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've maintained creative control while using AI strategically for research and technical tasks, and your nuanced view of both the benefits and the serious market concerns facing writers today.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that about covers it. Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research assistant while maintaining complete creative control, and your concerns about the broader market impacts, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the practical benefits you've found and the genuine challenges facing writers today. Best of luck finishing up that final book in your Mars series!
