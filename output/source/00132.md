Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good - no questions!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI much in my workday at the moment, but it is something my manager has been discussing and starting to think about how we could start using it safely and productively. At the moment I mainly only use AI for quickly drafting emails and summarising long notes.

AI: That's interesting that you're in that early exploration phase. When you do use AI for drafting emails and summarizing notes, what draws you to use it for those specific tasks rather than handling them yourself?

User: With the summaries, it is just massively time saving. I attend meetings and take extensive notes in real-time as the meeting is happening, and it is much quicker for me to just paste the notes into AI and get it to write a summary that I can email out to all attendees afterwards. Likewise with emails, I do consider myself pretty good at quickly writing clear emails, but sometimes I'm super busy and find I get stuck thinking of the right way to word something, it just saves me the little bit of time that would take, which all adds up.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - those time savings do add up. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I take referrals from vulnerable service users in my job - over the phone and by email mostly - and I type up all the referral information and then assign each case to a caseworker. This is admin work that I guess could be handled by AI, but I feel its better if I do it myself, as I feel I can use the referral information and my personal knowledge of the case workers and their personalities and abilities to match them up with the people they can help the most. For example, there might be context about the service user that's not apparent by just looking at the referral form, like their tone of voice when they spoke on the phone, or personal background knowledge of the area they live in or where they go to school..

AI: That's a really thoughtful example. It sounds like there's a lot of nuanced judgment and relationship knowledge that goes into that matching process that you feel is uniquely human. 

When you do use AI for those emails and summaries, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it what you need and let it handle it independently?

User: I will usually just give it the information and ask it to summarise, or just instruct it, 'write me an email to X stating that XYZ', but sometimes I will notice something I don't like, or something I feel needs changing, and will collaborate a little, asking it to change the tone or re-word something. Generally I'll only get into minimal back-and-forth though, because otherwise it becomes easier for me to just do it myself.

AI: That's a practical approach - keeping that balance between efficiency and control. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: To be honest, I feel that many of my colleagues and the sector I work in (charity, social care) are a little tech-phobic. A number of my colleagues still struggle using laptops for Teams meetings, which was something that started during lockdowns in 2020, and so the idea of using AI for them is quite daunting, and also for that reason I think, for management, the idea of combining these types of people with highly sensitive and personal data on service users and AI is a bit worrying. My direct manager, who I am personal assistant to, is keen to find ways to use AI for things like data analysis and report writing for funding bids, for example, but wary of encouraging a culture where everyone thinks you can use AI for everything and relies on it too much.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective on how the sector and existing tech comfort levels shape AI adoption. It sounds like there's a careful balance being struck between innovation and caution, especially given the sensitive nature of your work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I don't think there's really been a time for me when I've been left either particularly satisfied or frustrating. I guess there have been occaisions where I've tried to use it to help me write an email I've been struggling with, but ended up feeling like I've had to make so many corrections and requests that I may as well have just written the email myself.

AI: That resonates with what you mentioned earlier about keeping the back-and-forth minimal. It sounds like there's a tipping point where the collaboration becomes counterproductive.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really, in my role I feel that if AI could take over some of my tasks, that would just mean there would be more I could do in other areas.

AI: That's an interesting way to frame it - seeing AI as creating capacity rather than replacing skills. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Well, hopefully we will get some approval from upper management for a secure, official way to use AI for tasks like data analysis, sending out emails and texts as well would be useful, hopefully it can save me a lot of time from doing these mundane, time consuming tasks, but I think we'd need a specific platform and training for everyone on how to use it to make sure we're all on the same page.

AI: That vision of having proper infrastructure and training in place makes a lot of sense, especially given the sensitive nature of your work and your colleagues' varying comfort levels with technology.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance AI assistance with human judgment, especially in that example about matching service users with caseworkers based on nuanced understanding that goes beyond what's on paper.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so. Thanks!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI adoption in a cautious, relationship-focused work environment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
