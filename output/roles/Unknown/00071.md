Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No all good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I worked on developing organic semiconductor solar cells for underwater use. This began at a meeting at the marine biology centre where they were looking for ways to power small gps trackers for animals. Solar cells naturally fit this niche but standard Si cells are not efficient underwater due to the reduced amount of red light. Organic cells are much more efficient and can be tailored to work at different depths. I started with a literature review to find promising looking materials then fabricated films in a clean room before performing photoinduced absorption spectroscopy to test for charge generation. The most promising materials where then turned into functioning cells and tested under AM1.5G and a simulated underwater spectrum. I then wrote up my results.

AI: That's fascinating work - the connection between marine biology needs and materials science is really compelling. You've outlined a clear process from identifying the problem through to testing and documentation.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I experimented using AI tools in the literature review stage

AI: Tell me more about that. What specifically did you use AI for during your literature review, and how did that work out for you?

User: I used it to find organic semiconductors with specific optical properties that would be required for a good cell. This meant absorbing strongly between 300-650nm and a band gap of approximatly 2 eV

AI: That's really interesting - using AI to search for materials with those specific optical criteria. For that literature search task, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for finding those organic semiconductors.

User: I ended up using a manual search as the AI was unable to find good materials and instead only suggested common materials that would not be suitable

AI: That's a really valuable insight - so the AI defaulted to common materials rather than finding the specific ones that matched your optical criteria. Tell me more about what happened when you tried the AI approach - what did you ask it to do, and what kinds of materials was it suggesting that weren't suitable?

User: I asked it to find organic semiconductors that were strongly absorbing in the 300-650 nm region with a bandgap around 2 eV. It suggested common materials such as PIDT-BT and MEH-PPV that did not match my criteria

AI: I see - so it was giving you well-known materials from the literature but they didn't actually meet your specific absorption and bandgap requirements. That must have been frustrating when you had such precise criteria.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the fabrication, the spectroscopy testing, the cell testing, or the writing - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: The fabrication method used is standard so required no design, in the other areas I was hesitant to use AI after the previous bad experience as it would be harder to check its work for a mistake and my group had several experts I could ask for guidance.

AI: That makes complete sense - that initial experience really shaped how you viewed AI's reliability for the rest of your project. It sounds like trust became a key factor, especially when you had domain experts readily available.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: when you did try using AI for that literature search, how were you planning to verify or validate what it suggested to you?

User: I used it the winter of 2024, I asked the AI to link me papers describing the materials so that I could varify the absorption spectra and band gap myself before purchasing them.

AI: That's a smart verification approach - asking for the actual papers so you could check the data yourself. What happened when you asked for those paper links? Were you able to get the references you needed to verify the materials it was suggesting?

User: Yes they all worked fine  they just were not materials that matched my stated properties

AI: Ah, so the AI was giving you legitimate, accessible papers - it just wasn't understanding or properly filtering for your specific optical requirements. That's a really important distinction.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Literature reviews as they are tedious and time consuming to perform but it is relatively easy and quick for me to verify their findings by hand.

AI: That's really insightful - you still see the potential value in AI for literature reviews despite your experience. It sounds like the verification aspect is key for you - being able to quickly check the work makes it worth trying again.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on how that initial experience with AI not matching your specific criteria really shaped your approach to the rest of your research workflow was particularly illuminating. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI's inability to properly filter for specific material properties affected your trust and willingness to use it in other parts of your workflow really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The fact that you'd still be interested in using it for literature reviews - but with proper verification steps - shows how scientists are thinking practically about where AI might add value.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time today!

User: thanks
