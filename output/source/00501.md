Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me, let's get going.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Honestly, I haven't used AI in my typical workday for a long time. I tried using it some months back to help me write articles but it felt like doubling the workload.

AI: That's really interesting - the feeling that it doubled your workload rather than reducing it. Tell me more about that experience when you were trying to use it for article writing.

User: I started with a base of knowledge, indicated to the AI to summarise it and how - but then still needed to spend time making sure it was correct, and adapting it to my voice...and I felt like I had wasted time and could have just done it from the get go.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having to fact-check and then rework everything to match your voice sounds like it could easily take longer than just writing it yourself. 

When you say you "could have just done it from the get go," what does your usual article writing process look like when you're doing it entirely on your own?

User: Hmmm, for something that is liek a summary of information from multiple sources, I like to gather all the informaiton into a doc - then have that doc open side by side with the doc/space I'm using to write my article, then after reading through the information I will input information into my article outline.

AI: I see - so you have a very organized process where you collect everything first, then work through it systematically with your materials right there for reference. 

When you tried using AI for this, how did that process change? Were you still doing that same information gathering step, or did you try to skip straight to having the AI work with your sources?

User: I tried using AI to gather the information, but there was also information from older books that I wanted to include - so it was a combo of both.

AI: Ah, so you were trying to have AI help with gathering some of the information while you handled the books yourself. 

What happened when you tried to combine those two sources - the AI-gathered information and your book sources? How did that work out in practice?

User: Well, it sort of feeding the additional information into the AI and then asking it to summarise. Additionally, using the AI takes away the "learning" aspect of summarising information.

AI: That's a really insightful point about the learning aspect. Can you tell me more about what you mean by that - what kind of learning happens for you when you're doing the summarizing yourself that gets lost when AI does it?

User: When you summarise yourself, the information tends to stick more. It's like when you are studying for an exam and revise information and knowledge, and practice. That is completely lost if an AI is doing the revision or summarisation for you - as you are repeating the information from the sources, and skipping a step.

AI: That's such a valuable insight - that the act of processing and summarizing is itself part of how you internalize and retain the knowledge, not just a means to an end product.

Since you stepped away from using AI for article writing because of these issues, have you found yourself tempted to try it again for any other types of work tasks, or has that experience kept you away from workplace AI use altogether?

User: Since my work is mostly writing - the most I use is something like Grammarly - but even then, it's me making the final decisions in how the sentence sounds. I've used it a few times to come up with logo ideas - but then I refine it in software like illustrator.

AI: So it sounds like you're comfortable using AI as more of a starting point or suggestion tool - like with logo ideas - but you want to maintain control over the final creative decisions and refinement.

When you use it for logo ideas, how does that feel different from when you tried it for article writing? What makes that use case work better for you?

User: For a logo design, I have asked it to generate ideas say for a "running cactus" - then I look for portions or layouts that I like - for example if one response was a cactus wearing running shoes - and another of a anthropomorphised cactus in running stance - I may incorporate that further. Then take the idea to illustrator. I didn't look further for an AI that could complete that process and design svg files, etc.

AI: That's really interesting - so with logo work, you're using AI more for brainstorming and visual inspiration rather than asking it to produce the final deliverable. You're picking elements you like and then doing the actual design execution yourself.

It sounds like you made a deliberate choice not to look for AI that could complete the entire design process. What influenced that decision to stop at the idea generation stage rather than having AI create the final files?

User: Just didn't feel like investing time in finding a platform.

AI: That makes sense - the time investment of learning new platforms versus the benefit you'd get from it.

I'm curious about your colleagues or workplace culture. How have they influenced the way you use AI in your work, or have they had any influence at all on your approach?

User: I work by myself for myself. I have had some friends say its so easy to pop something into GPT for example to write an email, and may use something in the furture if I need to write a specific email or update my cv or something.

AI: So you're not getting workplace pressure to use AI since you work independently, but you're hearing from friends about quick tasks like email writing. 

You mentioned potentially using it for specific emails or CV updates in the future. What would make you decide to try AI for those tasks when you stepped away from it for article writing?

User: If I was having a tough time in writing a response for example, especially if feeling emotionally charged.

AI: That's really thoughtful - using AI as a tool to help you step back from emotional reactions and craft a more measured response. That seems quite different from the article writing situation where you felt it interfered with your learning process.

Can you share a time when using AI - whether for logo ideas or article writing - made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Lack of instruction following is annoying and frustrating - if I ask for a horse running in a field and the AI doesn't respond in a manner I find that frustrating. Or if I'm fact checking something and the model has misinterpreted or hallucinated a source for example. That's a waste of my time.

AI: That frustration with AI not following instructions or hallucinating sources really resonates with what you said earlier about it doubling your workload - you end up having to verify and correct things that should have been done right the first time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really factor into your thinking?

User: Rephrase the last paragraph

AI: How do you approach keeping your writing and creative skills sharp, knowing that AI tools are becoming more capable in these areas? Do you think about this at all?

User: By doing the writing and creative projects myself.

AI: That's pretty straightforward - just continuing to do the work yourself. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself trying it again for different tasks, or staying mostly on your current path?

User: Not particularly looking at evolving the relationship.

AI: That's fair - sounds like you've found what works for you.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that might be helpful for understanding how people interact with these tools?

User: In my day to day life - I really dislike the AI summaries in search results.

AI: That's really interesting and actually connects to what you shared earlier. Those AI summaries in search results - what specifically bothers you about them?

User: I would say that the sources don't always match the summary - meaning that when I click on a link, the information in the summary is not necessarily in the source. Which is annoying.

AI: That's a perfect example of the hallucination problem you mentioned earlier - the AI creating information that isn't actually in the sources it claims to be summarizing. It sounds like this reliability issue is a consistent frustration across different AI applications you've encountered.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can interfere with the learning process that happens when you summarize information yourself, and your approach of using AI only as a starting point for creative work rather than for final outputs.

Thank you for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the reliability challenges and the importance of maintaining direct engagement with your work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
