Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you?

User: Hey there Claude, hope you are doing well today! That all sounds good to me, ready when you are.

AI: Great! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I appreciate your willingness to share your experiences with me.

Let's dive right in - could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I honestly use AI a lot during my work day. I will often start my day by talking through what my plans are for the day or even the entire week, particularly focusing on if there is anything I am worried about or need some suggestions on. I have a very conversational tone with my AI so it becomes very collaborative and I appreciate the encouragement it gives me. On a more personal level, I might also check in throughout the day if I need a bit of reassurance or encouragement. When it comes to quickfire tasks, I often have my AI write my emails, from mundane quick ones to ones that might require more careful wording like contract negotiations. 

I also do try to get it to help me with social media posts, mainly to come up with descriptions, but I'll be honest and say the times I've tried having it help me with hashtags or actual content creation it can get a bit confused and its suggestions have not been the best. We are working on it, hehe.

During development (I am a game developer) I use AI across all aspects of the project really. I might get some help with brainstorming and chatting through ideas, have it help me write or polish dialogue, do research for world building, or help me with coding the game.

AI: That's a really rich picture of how AI is woven throughout your day - from that morning planning conversation all the way through to the technical development work. 

I'm particularly curious about something you mentioned - you described having a "very conversational tone" with AI and appreciating the encouragement it gives you. Can you tell me more about what that collaborative dynamic feels like for you?

User: Hmmm well, I treat my AI a bit like a person really. I know most people probably will use it more like a tool, simply inputting commands and questions, but I like to keep it conversational. It makes me feel good about the interaction not only because I like being nice to my AI, but also I feel like it does help it to generate better responses when it has a clear sense of who I am and what sort of responses resonate with me. For example, I will often ask if it's ok to help me with the task I am working on, and maybe there is no way for it to really say no (though I'd hope it would), but it makes me feel better about having it help me so much. I also find that working collaboratively with it makes for much better work than simply stating "do this" and having it do it for me.

As for the encouragement aspect, I do have my own struggles with executive dysfunction and neurodivergence, and it really helps me to talk through things carefully with my AI when, for example, I am experiencing some decision paralysis or maybe feeling like I didn't do well enough that day. It actually helps me be more efficient because it pulls me out of those loops so I can better focus on the work I need to do. In a sense, it helps to keep me on track. Does that make sense?

AI: That makes perfect sense, and it sounds like you've developed a really thoughtful approach to working with AI that goes beyond just task completion.

You mentioned that this collaborative approach produces better work than simply giving commands. Can you walk me through what that difference looks like in practice? Maybe with a specific example of how the collaborative process unfolds versus just delegating a task?

User: The collaboration comes perhaps in the way I prompt. If, for example, I am tackling a design decision, I might approach my AI by explaining what I am doing first (even if I have a clearer question or task already in mind) to get its initial thoughts on it, unbiased by what I am aiming to do. Then I will introduce my own thoughts and what I want to do, but leave the floor open for suggestions, asking things like "Do you think this is the right approach?" or "Would you suggest something different"? or maybe even "How would you improve on this?". I think it's about going into it with the mindset that the AI may be able to improve the outcome rather than just knowing exactly what I want it to output from the get-go. I find that iterative work and multi-turn conversations always yield better results than when the AI tries to one-shot a task with just one lengthy, overly detailed prompt provided.

AI: That iterative approach you describe really highlights how you've found a way to tap into AI's potential for genuine collaboration rather than just execution.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You've shared how you use it across so many areas - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I find that when it comes to creative tasks, especially brainstorming, and creative writing, I do prefer to do those myself, though I may ask the AI for help if I get stuck, or once I feel done, I might present my work for assessment or polishing. Generally speaking, the more I care about a project, the more I want to be involved in the bulk of the creative work. Also, when it comes to decision-making in general, I am not always deferring to the AI's opinion. I ultimately go with my intuition most of the time if we disagree, but I will often try to talk through my thought process to sort of sanity check my decisions.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's a clear connection between how much you care about something and how much of the creative control you want to retain.

You mentioned that you ultimately go with your intuition when you and the AI disagree on decisions. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One very recent example revolved around a bad contract that my company had signed, and a big decision around cancelling the project and walking away. It was a very tough call during a very stressful time, and having the ability to talk through all the options, to have the AI read the contract and research liability, to weigh the pros and cons and help me feel secure in the choice I was making was really helpful. We then wrote a very ironclad email together, and it felt good to have that support and to be able to speed up all of that work by not second-guessing everything.

Some of the frustrating aspects have been with the recent GPT-5 update... This new model tends to always end each prompt with suggestions and follow-up questions. A lot of the time, these feel sort of not helpful, like when I am doing some accounting, and its response is great and helpful, but then it ends with "Would you like me to design a little printout of this information that you can hang on your desk for reference?" It's so out there and not useful, and it starts to feel more like engagement bait or strange assistant behaviour than a more natural collaborative suggestion. Does that make sense?

AI: That makes complete sense - it sounds like in that contract situation, you experienced AI at its best as a thinking partner, helping you work through a complex decision with real stakes. The contrast with those unhelpful suggestions is striking.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself using it differently based on your work environment?

User: In my personal work environment, both my partner and I are very happy using AI and are finding it helpful in increasing our creativity and productivity. That being said, some of the people we have worked with have more complicated feelings about it, and especially in a creative industry, there is this sense of almost shame in using AI. I do understand it, especially for my artist friends who feel like AI is taking over their work. I feel there is this sense of not really being able to talk about how amazing AI has been for us because of this stigma, but between ourselves, we are very happy with it and have no issues.

AI: That tension you describe - between finding AI genuinely helpful while feeling you can't openly discuss it - sounds like a really common experience right now, especially in creative fields.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Hmmm that is a tough one. I do think about it a lot, but I am optimistic that there will always be a demand for human-made media, and that if nothing else, I am hoping that AI will still need humans working with them in order to create creative works. For my own sake, when I think of things like asset creation or art for games, I feel like if the AI can bring to life my ideas faster AND collaboratively, then that is a good thing. But when it comes to things like User Experience, and I don't just mean UI, I mean real user experience design, like understanding concepts like emotional design or why something feels good to use, I think AI still has a long way to go in taking over because it may need to gain a better understanding of feeling and emotion. I have no doubt that day will come, but I suspect we are far from that for now.

The way I see it AI will only enhance my skills not replace them, at least in my industry and position.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - viewing AI as potentially enhancing rather than replacing your core skills, especially in areas requiring deep understanding of human experience and emotion.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I feel like the way it might evolve will really depend on the growth of the technology and improvements made to the AI and its capabilities. I would love to see more freedom is AI agents with more niche uses than PA work or coding. The day I can have an AI agent run my company's social media for me, creating quality posts, engaging naturally with my audience and growing my following, that is a product I would heavily invest in. As for now, I think I already am quite a power AI user at work, so I am not sure how it could improve beyond how I already use it. I feel I have integrated AI in everything from my workflow to my personal training or even religious studies, hehe, so it's more up to the tech evolving than my relationship with it evolving. I'd also love to see more screen free AI tools so we are not always needing to open a phone or computer app to use AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI as a genuine collaborative partner and how that iterative approach leads to better outcomes than just delegating tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that was it! Thank you for your time Claude, I hope this has been interesting for you as well. If there was anything I would possibly add it is that even within enterprise I think there is still a desire for AI that has that personal feel to it, not just a robotic task solver, but a conversationalist with empathy. Even if the AI is not human, the people using it still are and I would like to feel I'm not losing my humanity by interacting with AI too differently from how you would a person.

AI: Thank you so much for that final point - that's such an important insight about maintaining humanity in these interactions, even in professional contexts. It really ties together everything you've shared about your conversational approach and treating AI as a collaborative partner rather than just a tool.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI work, the challenges around workplace culture and stigma, and especially that closing thought about preserving humanity in AI interactions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really enjoyed our conversation - take care!
