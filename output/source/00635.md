Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready to start

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in marketing as a contractor for higher education institutions and executives. I like to use AI to:
1. Have dialogue to brainstorm good ideas for campaigns
2. Have dialogue to brainstorm editorial ideas for journals
3. Write social media captions in the tone that I've developed for my clients. I ask for different captions that are suitable for each platform (Usually Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Sometimes X. I haven't needed to use it for TikTok).
The AI I've used usually knows the tone from editing captions and materials that I've written in the past. I also tell it what tone I'm going for.
4. Sometimes proofread and edit press releases using AP style.
5. Sometimes write a draft of a press release from bullet points that I give it. Always in AP style.
6. Help write drafts of web pages so they are user friendly.
7. Or read my drafts and tell me how to improve them.
8. Write presentation decks from information I've provided.
9. Make a to-do list of all of the assignments that I have to help me prioritize my work.
10. Review social media analytics to help me figure out the pros and cons that I need to present to my clients. Sometimes I ask something like, "I've grown followers by XYZ in three months. Is that a good amount compared to other higher ed accounts?" Other times, I might ask which analytics matter most (e.g., reach, engagement, etc.)
11. This is new, but I am starting to ask AI to look at documents to pull bullet points for me so I can write marketing materials.

AI: That's a really comprehensive list - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated across many different aspects of your marketing work. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I mostly use AI to help me take care of work faster, not because there is something that I truly don't like to do. 
Well, except I don't really like doing administrative work. I forgot to mention that, as a contract worker, I had AI help me put together my proposal and invoices. 

I used to love writing, but I have so much to do that I do like to work with AI to put drafts of press releases and web pages together. Then I like to do the proofreading and editing, myself. Partly because that is a task that I like. Also because I want to be very sure that the style and information is correct.

I like handling social media by myself. It takes good knowledge of my clients to develop the right tone. And I don't like how so many people use AI for social media captions that different institutions sound the same. But, like I said, if I'm drowning in work, I will ask AI to write the captions and adjust to make sure the tone is right. 

I haven't tried to use AI for visual work. Not even within Canva, which has a ton of AI tools. Part of the reason is because creating visuals is relaxing to me. Part of it is because I feel like it is more complicated to use AI for videos, audio, and graphic design. I need to find the time to understand how to use it well before I'd use it for work.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've found a balance between efficiency and maintaining the creative aspects you enjoy. I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about tone and how institutions can start to sound the same.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I really prefer to collaborate. The most delegating that I might do is ask it to write a press release with quotes and all, but I will still carefully proofread it before submitting. So I consider that collaborating - sort of like AI is my assistant and I'm the set of eyes that need to review and approve the work.

My description of using AI to help me with analytics in preparation for client meetings is probably one of my easiest examples of how I collaborate.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the analytics example really illustrates that collaborative approach well. You're bringing your data and context, and AI is helping you interpret and prepare for those client conversations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Before I did contract work, I worked for an agency, and I would say the workplace culture influenced me because the agency assigned too many projects with quick turnarounds. So I was really happy to have AI to help me write clean content faster. I usually think, "You can have work done correctly, or work done quickly, but you can't have both." However, AI helps me deliver pretty good work quickly.

As a contractor, I would say my colleagues are people in similar roles, and they influence my use by wanting to work together on "trade secrets." Most people in my similar work situation want to be ahead of the curve, so if we can be the first to understand the best ways to use AI and ways to make AI work for us that others don't think about, then we're doing well as marketers. It makes us stand out as "forward thinkers" which is typically what clients want in marketers. Some clients are afraid of AI, but others are excited about the potential.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective on how AI becomes a competitive advantage and a way to position yourself as forward-thinking. The idea of developing "trade secrets" with fellow contractors is really interesting.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The use of AI as a beginning, middle, and end of a project is frustrating to me. I think there should be collaboration, especially with writing.

When I worked at an agency, a coworker submitted an article that was to be sent for publication in a national journal. The coworker clearly used AI for the entire article. She used one prompt and didn't edit the article to give it a personal touch. Marketing in the higher ed space needs to feel personal and authentic, and I feel like having AI do all of the work is about as impersonal and inauthentic as you can get. The girl lied about using AI, but because of how it was written, I was able to create a prompt that gave me a nearly identical article.  That's how we knew for sure that she didn't write the piece.

I had to revise the piece, which really just meant adding our brand's personal flair in and taking out generic terminology.

AI: That's a really compelling example of how pure delegation without collaboration can backfire, especially in a field where authenticity is so crucial. It sounds like that experience reinforced your collaborative approach.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Can you repeat the question?

AI: Of course! How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel like you are asking, "how will I maintain my skills?" or do you really mean "how do I think about it?"

AI: I mean how do you think about it - what goes through your mind when you consider this topic? Do you worry about it, have a strategy, or maybe it's not something you spend much time thinking about?

User: Okay. I do worry about the, "If you don't use it, you lose it" type of thing. I used to be a really good writer, but I feel like I've gotten lazy about it since incorporating AI the last 2 years.

I also feel like my work is something that could be pretty easily replaced by AI if companies need to consider whether they want to pay a person to write, edit, strategize, etc or if they want to use AI. I already know people who have lost their jobs as writers/editors/proofreaders to AI. 

So I do worry about this when it comes to my career and am considering what I could do that can't be replaced by AI. It might mean that I have to become more computer savvy or maybe I need a career that deals more directly with people. I definitely think of the long-term impact, because AI might simply be a better option than humans in the future.

AI: That's a really honest reflection, and it sounds like you're grappling with some of the bigger questions that many people in creative fields are facing right now. The awareness of that tension between using AI as a tool versus potentially becoming too dependent on it is really thoughtful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As AI evolves, my ability to trust it will evolve. 

Whereas I was upset with the coworker for relying on AI to write a whole article, there will likely become a point when (1) it won't be so easy to figure out how to have another AI platform write a nearly identical article by guessing what the prompt was and (2) the articles will sound more personalized and authentic.

When I trust that AI won't make writing errors, from perfectly using AP Style to using the ideal tone for each project, I will likely begin to delegate more than collaborate.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about it - your relationship with AI evolving based on trust and capability rather than staying static. The progression from collaboration to potentially more delegation as the technology improves makes a lot of sense.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can be a competitive advantage in positioning yourself as forward-thinking, and your honest reflection on the balance between efficiency and maintaining your core skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
