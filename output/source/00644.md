Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great. Let's get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI every day, but I try to. I'm an instructional designer and I create eLearning courses. The single biggest use I have for AI right now is generating text-to-speech to use as narration. I also use AI to help me analyze large sets of documentation to help me do instructional and task analysis. I don't trust AI to write anything for me at my same level of quality, but I will use it as a tool to help me synthesize information from multiple sources, or to help me make a long paragraph more concise.

AI: That's really interesting - you've found some specific niches where AI adds value to your instructional design work. 

Tell me more about that text-to-speech use for narration. How has that changed your workflow compared to how you used to handle narration before?

User: Prior to using AI, I would record all my own voiceovers and then clean them up and edit them in Audacity. That can be very time-consuming, and even though I am comfortable recording my own voice, I sometimes have to do multiple takes to get it to sound right, and then the final editing just feels tedious and frustrating the older the I get. Speaking of getting old, my voice isn't what it used to be. Sometimes if I need to make an update to course and have to record new lines of audio, the way my voice sounds at the time can differ significantly than how it was when I originally created the course. 

Text-to-speech has allowed me to reduce my production time by about half, which in turn helps reduce my own boredom and frustration with the recording and editing process. It also helps me ensure consistency in audio quality rather than be beholden to how good my voice sounds on a given day.

AI: That's a significant time savings - cutting production time in half is huge. It sounds like the consistency aspect is really valuable too, especially for course updates.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you don't trust AI to write at your same level of quality. Are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Writing is the main task that I prefer to do myself, but I consider AI as a tool to support me in that rather than something I can trust to do the work for me. When I have tried to use AI tools to write instructional materials for me, I often find that the "voice" that the AI writes with comes across more as a marketing or salesperson rather than an instructor. 

Instead, I treat AI like a personal assistant who looks over something and gives me feedback. Like my own personal editing department. Or if I'm writing something and having trouble synthesizing multiple concepts into a concise sentence or two, AI is great at helping with that. Also, sometimes I just need to think outside of my own box and get a different point of view. AI is helpful for that.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about AI's role - as a personal assistant and editing department rather than a replacement writer. The observation about AI having more of a "marketing voice" versus an "instructor voice" is particularly insightful.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it throughout tasks.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration process. What does a typical back-and-forth look like when you're working through something together?

User: So let's say I have a handbook and I need to use the information in it to produce a training course. I'll feed the handbook to the AI and ask it to give me a summary of all the major topics. I'll take that information and my team will decide which topics need to be included. Then I'll have the AI model highlight the main tasks for each topic and generate a bulleted list of steps that I need to go over. I'll also ask it to identify any industry-specific jargon and give me a quick definition. I'll use the output from that as a kind of roadmap for me research the topics and begin outlining the instructional material. While I'm working on my various outlines and storyboards, I'll use AI to help me find definitions for words or brainstorm ideas for teaching a certain concept, but I never rely on AI to do all of that work for me.

AI: That's a really systematic approach - using AI as a research assistant to break down and organize information, then building your own instructional materials from there. It sounds like you've developed a clear workflow where AI handles the initial analysis and organization, but you maintain control over the actual instructional design decisions.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Several of my colleagues began using text-to-speech a few years before I adopted it into my workflow. I was slow to adopt it because, historically, the quality was never good enough compared to my own voice. But all the factors I mentioned previously have brought me around to it and now I rely on it all the time. 

My workplace culture is trying to be proactive about adopting AI and we're all trying to find the right balance of quality and efficiency. I think most of us are coming around to the idea that AI is best used to support our work rather than do it for us completely.

AI: It sounds like your team is taking a measured, collaborative approach to finding that balance. That's interesting that you were initially skeptical about text-to-speech quality but colleagues' experiences helped influence your eventual adoption.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think the main instance was trying to get it produce some instructional content that didn't sound like a sales pitch or a commercial. It felt as if the model had been trained by a marketing department rather than someone like me.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you're trying to create authentic instructional content and the AI keeps defaulting to that promotional tone. 

What was it specifically about the language or approach that made it feel so much like marketing rather than instruction? Was there a particular moment when you realized this wasn't going to work the way you hoped?

User: It was just the tone. It came across as a bit too juvenile, or like it was written by someone who wrote a cheesy Marvel movie. Saying stuff like, "Isn't that awesome," was not the correct tone I needed.

AI: That "cheesy Marvel movie" comparison really captures it - that overly enthusiastic, juvenile tone is definitely not what you need for professional instructional content. It sounds like there's a real disconnect between the conversational, encouraging tone an instructor needs versus that over-the-top promotional style.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm trying to become more skilled in using AI to help with tasks that I know it's good at so that I can focus on the more high value tasks that I use at work.

AI: That's a strategic approach - leaning into AI's strengths so you can concentrate on higher-value work. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I'm going to continue to use mostly for text-to-speech and as a research assistant.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI having that "marketing voice" versus the instructor voice you need - that's such a nuanced observation about tone and audience.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between AI efficiency and maintaining quality, especially in instructional design, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the successes - like that significant time savings with text-to-speech - and the challenges, like getting the right instructional tone. Have a great rest of your day!
