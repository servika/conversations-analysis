Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to reply to complex emails, to check my responses, to summarise complex policy. Sometimes I use it for advice in complicated situations

AI: That's a nice range of uses. I'm particularly interested in when you mentioned using it for advice in complicated situations. 

Tell me more about that - what kinds of complicated situations come up where you turn to AI for advice?

User: Where its unclear in how the policy applies to a particular situation, I will link the policy and tell it the scenario and ask for advice

AI: That sounds really practical. When you're working through those policy questions with AI, how does that process typically unfold for you?

Do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI to work through the nuances, or do you more often present the full scenario and let it give you a complete analysis to work from?

User: Generally I present the full scenario. But sometimes I'll ask follow up questions or clarification

AI: That makes sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: AI would be helpful for all day to day enquiries, but I tend to handle the straightforward cases without turning to AI. Only when it requires a more considered response or unpicking detailed scenarios do I ask Ai

AI: Interesting - so you're making strategic choices about when to bring AI in. It sounds like you save it for the more complex, nuanced work rather than the routine stuff.

When you do use AI for those complex scenarios, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach that? Do people around you use AI similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: My workplace is fairly slow to adopt it, but there has been some talk about the adopting and use of AI. I don't think my immediate colleagues use it at all, but I know that some of the wider team use it in day to day business to send out comms to the team or deal with customer enquiries - particularly management but also others

AI: So you're somewhat of an early adopter in your immediate circle. That's an interesting position to be in.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had a particularly argumentative customer and I was struggling to articulate the nuances of the policy, but I knew what I wanted to say. AI did a really good job of curating the response, correctly referencing the relevant parts of the policy in a professional manner

AI: That sounds like a really effective collaboration - you had the knowledge and judgment about what needed to be communicated, and AI helped you craft it professionally. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No, it's not something I've thought about. My line of work isn't particularly swift in adapting new technology so I feel like it would take a long time until we would be in that position

AI: That's a fair perspective given your workplace's pace with technology adoption.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: In terms of communication and policy interpretation I envisage relying on it more frequently, but there are elements of my job that can't be carried out by AI so that wouldn't change

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you strategically choose when to bring AI into your workflow - saving it for the complex, nuanced situations rather than routine tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about being an early adopter in a slower-moving workplace, and how you've found AI most helpful for complex policy interpretation and professional communication, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
