Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions! I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a freelance screenwriter and film producer. I have worked independently, but I have also been on writing teams. Generally, I will come up with an idea for a screenplay, write it and then try to find a creative team to work with to seek funding. Occasionally I have been contracted to work on writing teams, but this is less frequent.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic mix of creative and business work. I'm curious about how AI fits into that process for you.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: So far, I have only used AI when it comes to more administrative tasks like composing emails or coming up with the wording for aspects of applications. The most creative use is potentially coming up with loglines/pitches. I generally have an idea of what I want the pitch to look like, but may outsource to AI if I have a mental block.

AI: That's interesting - so you're using AI more as a support tool for the business side and occasionally to break through creative blocks with pitches. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: The last project relied on the website Boosted to partially raise funding. I used AI to write the call to action for people who might be willing to donate some money to our creative work. In terms of how it felt, I think there's always a little bit of shame that comes with using AI in my line of work. Most of the creatives I work with are very concerned about the impact on our field, and I have a bit of anxiety that if it's obvious I've used AI for any part of the project it may impact my credibility when it comes to the rest of my work. I'm very cautious about using it, and will always rewrite the output to sound more like 'me.'

AI: That's a really honest perspective - I appreciate you sharing that. The tension between finding AI helpful and worrying about how it's perceived in your field sounds quite complex.

When you do use AI and then rewrite the output to sound more like you, how would you describe that process? What does it feel like to take that AI-generated content and make it your own?

User: Honestly, it's time saving. I struggle slightly with structuring professional writing so AI's output generally has a structure I can use. I'll generally just change the wording of the sentences or the word choices. Prior to using AI, I would have searched for a template on Google (like I might search: Movie Pitch Template or Cover Letter Template) and then used the same process, so it feels pretty intuitive to use it in this way.

AI: That's a really helpful comparison - using AI like you would use a template you'd find online. It sounds like for you, AI is serving a similar function to those existing resources but maybe more efficiently.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Very few aspects have changed, my creative process is still largely similar. It's saved me a bit of time being able to generate an email or pitch quickly, but I have not found AI useful for the bulk of what I do. I have tried to use AI for things like brainstorming, but I did not feel that it was helpful. I would personally not use AI for writing, mainly because I enjoy the process and I tend to have a clear idea of what I want as opposed to a pitch which I feel can be quite generic.

AI: That distinction you're making is really interesting - that pitches can be more generic while your actual writing is something you have a clear vision for and enjoy doing yourself.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I am worried that an oversaturation of low effort work may reduce opportunities for newcomers. If people can't be bothered to write their own work, then it's hard to justify why other people should bother to read it. If production companies are receiving huge amounts of AI written content, they may be inclined to return to established directors/writers/producers instead of seeking out new voices. My personal belief is that this would disproportionately effect minority writers.

AI: That's a really thoughtful concern about how AI could potentially create barriers for emerging voices, especially minority writers. The idea that oversaturation of low-effort content might push industry gatekeepers toward established names makes a lot of sense.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Could see leaning into more practical implementations of AI as opposed to creative. For example, being able to generate a call sheet based on various factors or being able to filter through a number of grant/funding opportunities to determine which ones would be appropriate for our current project. In terms of the creative side, I don't see that changing for me personally. I don't feel the need to use it currently and it's hard to imagine what would lead to that changing.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - focusing AI on the logistical side where it could genuinely streamline your workflow without touching the creative core that you value doing yourself.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI, particularly around that tension between finding it useful for certain tasks while being mindful of how it's perceived in your field. I also found your perspective on the potential impact on emerging voices really valuable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I did also just want to share that mistrust in AI's factuality prevents me from using it for research in the early development of a project. I have had too many experiences where AI has provided me things that are blatantly incorrect and I've only noticed because I'm already familiar with the topic. It takes just as much fact checking as using Google to locate a trusted source myself, so this is something that I think is worth flagging. Many writers spend a lot of time researching and this is an area where AI could certainly be helpful if it was reliable or at least easy to verify.

AI: That's a really important point - the reliability issue is clearly a significant barrier for research-heavy work like yours. The fact that you've caught AI providing incorrect information makes complete sense why you'd stick with traditional research methods where you can trace back to trusted sources.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical applications you find useful, the concerns about industry gatekeeping, and especially that research reliability issue will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your candid perspective on both the benefits and limitations you've experienced.
