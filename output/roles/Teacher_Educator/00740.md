Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work at a elementary school as an assistant SPED teacher. I use AI a lot to generate creative ideas for possible projects, assignments and fun activities for different students by giving parameters that outline each students disability, strengths and weaknesses. I also use it quite a bit to help me keep track of meetings, due dates and set reminders.

AI: That sounds like you've found some really practical ways to integrate AI into your work with students. 

Tell me more about how you use AI for generating those creative ideas. What does that process typically look like for you?

User: Typically I would say something like "I have five fourth grade students that are autistic and right now we are learning simple addition and subtraction. Help me come up with a fun activity that uses different objects within a game that can demonstrate addition and subtraction while holding their attention with things they can touch for sensory".

AI: That's a really specific and thoughtful way to frame your requests. It sounds like you're drawing on your knowledge of each student to give the AI the right context.

When you get those activity suggestions back from AI, what happens next? Do you typically use them as-is, or do you find yourself modifying them based on what you know about your specific students?

User: Sometimes I need to modify if the AI gives an activity that I know will be too complex but often the activity is fine as is. For example, it has given me an activity that has the kids pretend to run a cookie and lemonade stand with fake food and drinks which was perfectly fine for the age of kids

AI: That cookie and lemonade stand activity sounds like it would be engaging for the kids. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to write my own correspondence like emails and letters to parents because I do not necessarily trust the writing will fulfill exactly what I need without adding stuff it shouldn't. I also prefer to create my own actual assignments or use the ones that come in my curriculum books as sometimes the AI is not able to continue a subject for a weeks worth of assignments without being repetitive or seeming out of order.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like for those more sensitive communications and longer-term planning, you want that direct control over the content and flow.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it handle the task independently?

User: When I am using it to generate creative ideas I tend to give all the information up front so I can set all the parameters and include everything necessary like materials lists and things like that. When I do this I do not often have to make any corrections unless I forgot something to add. When I use it to set reminders, make a schedule or outline a presentation then I usually begin with something like "lets make a calendar for this week beginning on Monday and ending on Sunday" then I would say "Every morning except Saturday and Sunday should begin with setting up centers at 7:50" and then I would keep adding as I check things of my list so I can see the schedule and move stuff around as needed.

AI: That's interesting how you adapt your approach based on the type of task. It sounds like for the creative activities you can be very comprehensive upfront, but for scheduling you prefer that iterative approach where you can see things building and adjust as you go.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at your school use it similarly, or has their approach affected yours in any way?

User: Actually yes, the idea to make and keep my schedule while adding to it and setting reminders was one given and demonstrated to us by our vice principal and it has been very handy

AI: That's great that your vice principal introduced that approach and it's been working well for you.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was able to use the AI to completely plan and organize my holiday parties and generate shopping lists, volunteer sign ups, directions for tables and activities. This made something that is usually a headache so easy and all I had to do was print and make copies to hand out.

AI: That sounds like it transformed what's usually a stressful task into something much more manageable. The fact that you could go straight from the AI output to just printing and copying must have saved you so much time.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: If AI was a little more job specific or was able to learn me, my speech patterns and how I write then I would definitely consider having AI take over some of my other tasks.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - it sounds like you'd be open to AI handling more if it could better match your personal style and understand your specific work context.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am hoping that AI will be a more collaborative partner that will help me better manage my time and help me expand creatively so I can offer my students a wide variety of activities and assignments that I may not have been able to come up with on my own.

AI: That vision of AI as a collaborative partner to enhance your creativity and time management sounds really thoughtful.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really valuable insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described adapting your interaction style based on the task - being comprehensive upfront for creative activities but iterative for scheduling.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: The only thing I would add is I would like for AI to be better about storing more information so that I could keep my calendar, lists, assignments, ideas and more without worrying about it being forgotten.

AI: That's really valuable feedback - having that persistent memory and storage capability would clearly make AI much more useful as a true collaborative partner in your daily work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you're using AI to support your students with special needs, and your thoughtful approach to deciding what to delegate versus handle yourself, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and thank you again for contributing to our research. Your work with your students sounds really meaningful.
