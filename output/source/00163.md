**Transcript ID:** User: My employer frequently uses a practice we refer to as ""lampshading

---

" where we hint at what we're talking about in the title, but don't say what it is explicitly. For example, we might say "The Director of this $525 Million Monster Movie Wants to Do a Sequel." I asked the model to help me come up with title suggestions that lampshaded the topic, all of its suggestions clearly referenced the topic in the title and many of them added things that were factually incorrect. When I explained what I wanted by lampshading, the model tried to argue with me that lampshading is when you acknowledge a flaw in the title and that my requests were incorrect. The model's definition of lampshading doesn't seem to be supported and I have zero desire to argue with an LLM about the definition of anything. It's a huge waste of time.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when the AI doubled down and tried to argue about your own workplace's terminology rather than just following your clear instructions. That's a perfect example of where the collaboration breaks down.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I have low-level anxiety about losing income all the time. It's a terrible time!

AI: I can really understand that concern - that uncertainty about the future must add a lot of stress to daily work life.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'll continue to use it as instructed by my employer. If AI is every able to handle mundane tasks, I would gladly outsource all of that work to the model, but that doesn't seem to be possible currently.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI struggles with nuanced tasks like understanding your site's voice and terminology, while also being required to use it regularly by your employer.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I've covered everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the gap between what you'd want to delegate versus what AI can actually handle well, and especially those specific examples of where collaboration works and where it breaks down, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through those real examples from your work - it gives us such valuable perspective on how these tools are actually being used day-to-day.
