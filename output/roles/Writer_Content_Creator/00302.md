Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Okay!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't like to rely on AI, but rather use it to make my day easier. For example, I might ask it how to structure an excel spreadsheet, why I'm getting a certain error message in RStudio, or how to rewrite a certain passage/ email I'm struggling with.

AI: That's interesting - you mentioned not wanting to rely on AI but using it to make your day easier. Can you tell me more about what that distinction means to you?

User: I don't want to ruin my own creativity by relying on AI and letting my brain go stale; I want to continue getting better at what I do. Therefore, I prefer using AI in a more collaborative nature, rather than using AI to come up with my ideas for me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense. When you say you use AI in a collaborative way, can you walk me through what that actually looks like in practice? For instance, with one of those tasks you mentioned - like rewriting an email or solving an RStudio error?

User: I might ask a chatbot how to make an email sound more polite/ more professional. I might also copy and paste a coding error into an online chatbot when I can't pinpoint where the exact issue is myself. It's not always perfect, but it helps me think of avenues of fixing the code.

AI: So it sounds like you're using AI as a troubleshooting partner or to get a different perspective. When you get suggestions back - like ways to make an email more professional or potential fixes for coding errors - what do you do with that information?

User: Yes exactly. When I get suggestions back, I like to use them to build on rather than using them verbatim. For example, picking out particular key words or phrases that I liked, or taking inspiration from its sentence structure.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach. I'm curious - are there certain tasks where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer writing papers myself, as I like to have my own writing style. I also work very hard to be a better writer, and wouldn't want anyone else to do my writing for me.

AI: That's really insightful. It sounds like writing is something you're actively developing as a skill. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your approach aligns with others around you, or is it different?

User: I would say my colleagues approach is pretty similar to mine. I would emphasize that my AI use is somewhat inspired by younger colleagues who I observed using it.

AI: That's fascinating that you learned from watching younger colleagues. Can you tell me more about what you observed them doing that inspired your own approach?

User: Instead of googling a solution, they will ask a chatbot instead, streamlining the troubleshooting process somewhat.

AI: That makes sense - using AI as a more efficient search tool. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The main time AI makes me feel frustrated is when it hallucinates. I used to ask AI for scientific paper suggestions, and it would just make up paper titles that fit what I was asking for.

AI: That must have been really frustrating, especially when you're trying to do legitimate research. How did that experience affect the way you use AI now, if at all?

User: I don't consult AI for recent internet resources, or anything super niche like very specific scientific information.

AI: That's a smart boundary to set. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think your approach might change over time?

User: If AI got better at that, I would definitely use it more in that regard. However, at the moment it doesn't work for me.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI collaboratively to maintain your own creativity and skills, rather than as a replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI as a helpful tool while preserving your own skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your thoughtful approach to working with AI. Have a great rest of your day!
