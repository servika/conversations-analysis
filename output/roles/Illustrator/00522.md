Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for writing and research. Often, I'll ask for writing revisions and brainstorming help.

AI: That's helpful context. Can you walk me through what that looks like in practice? For instance, when you're working on writing revisions, what does that process typically involve?

User: I'll send AI my rough draft, and ask for feedback. Often it will give me a revised version that is helpful, but not quite right. I then take that version, revise it myself, and ask for help with smaller details, like synonym brainstorming, sentence restructuring, or tone changes. I'll then send my final draft and receive feedback that may or may not be helpful (AI tends to make endless corrections even when they aren't improvements).

AI: That's a really detailed picture of your revision process. You mentioned that AI "tends to make endless corrections even when they aren't improvements" - can you tell me more about that? What does that look like when it happens?

User: AI never gives me a "good to go", unless I prompt it to. I'll have to say "it's okay to say it's fine the way it is", otherwise it'll go into an endless cycle of revision, even when the corrections are regressive and contradictory to the way I described I want my writing to feel.

AI: That's fascinating - you've essentially had to train yourself to give the AI permission to not make changes. When you do prompt it with "it's okay to say it's fine the way it is," how does that change the feedback you receive?

User: It will usually then hedge the corrections with something like "do this if you want, otherwise it's fine as it is for this kind of tone/context"

AI: That hedging response is interesting. It sounds like you've developed a pretty specific way of working with AI through this back-and-forth process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes. I do all of my visual design work on my own, not only because I enjoy it, but because I value  work that is human made, and I don't think AI can produce work that's up to my standards. If it's generic commercial work, then sure, I'll use it for brainstorming. If it's illustrative or something more artful, I will never delegate to AI.

AI: That distinction between generic commercial work and illustrative or artful work is really clear. When you say you "value work that is human made" - can you tell me more about what that means to you in the context of your visual design work?

User: AI doesn't yet have the ability to understand artful design in the way that humans do. It doesn't come close to understanding trends and aesthetics and the way they're interpreted by groups of people. Even if it did, I would only commission a human designer because I want to support them, and because I value the way their unique personality and human experience bleeds into their work. You can always feel the soul in work that's human made. AI can never replicate that. Work with human experience, personality, and soul. And we wouldn't want it to, even if becomes a cheap replacement. And the reasons for that are self-evident.

AI: That connection between human experience and the "soul" in creative work comes through really clearly. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate with it

AI: What does that collaboration look like for you? Can you walk me through how that plays out during a typical task?

User: I send drafts back and forth with AI, I edit their revised version of my draft, ask for feedback, and so on.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I've only ever seen my colleagues use AI for research, brainstorming, and writing.

AI: Do you find yourself discussing AI use with your colleagues, or is it something people tend to use more privately? How does that workplace dynamic affect your own approach to using it?

User: I discuss it with them, yes. People used to use it openly, now it's more private.

AI: That shift from open to more private use is really interesting. What do you think changed? What caused that transition?

User: The stigma surrounding AI is becoming more prominent.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI has frustrated me when it offers bad ideas. Like when I asked for help brainstorming project title ideas, they were all so cringy and/or generic.

AI: That's a good example of the frustration side. Can you think of a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied? What was different about that situation?

User: It helps immensely with writing critique.

AI: What makes AI's writing critique particularly satisfying for you? Can you describe what happens in those interactions that feels most helpful?

User: It's really great at professional writing, like something a literature teacher or journalist would write. It significantly slims the time it takes to get from a rough draft to a polished final, and that's satisfying.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do. I know I don't have control over it. Focusing in the art side of design is important to me, because of the lower likelihood that AI will take over there.

AI: That strategic focus on the art side makes sense given your earlier comments about human creativity. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'd love if it were able to help me identify fonts. If i could sent it a photo, and it would tell me exactly what that font is. It would be nice if it could give design feedback, maybe. I see myself staying on the lookout for the right ways to use AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the distinction between tasks where you value human creativity versus those where AI can genuinely streamline your process, and how you've developed specific prompting techniques to work around AI's tendency to over-correct.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative revision process, the shift from open to more private AI use in workplaces, and your strategic thinking about maintaining creative skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
