Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. No questions. Begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to help me design activities for our assisted living, or to brainstorm them. Today I used it to help me with a recipe for a group cooking class. Another thing I regularly do is use it write the description of all the movies we show. And it has helped me write parts of our newsletters and our letters to residents and families.

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you with quite a variety of creative and communication tasks at the assisted living facility. 

Tell me more about how you use it for brainstorming activities - what does that process typically look like for you?

User: I've asked AI a couple of times lately to help me find places to bring our residents in our area, based on different themes. Good picnic spots, best free art museums, simple drives for our memory care trips. So I'll just describe what I'm looking for and look at the results. Then if I have any questions, I'll ask follow-ups. And if things look weird, I'll double check using a regular web search.

AI: That's interesting - you mention double-checking with regular web searches when things look weird. What kinds of things make you think "I should verify this myself"?

User: For the art museum trip, I gave it a geographic limit, and I thought that some of the places it suggested were beyond our range (and they were). One of the picnic spots it suggested was a rail trail; I had to check and make sure there was no picnic area as part of it (there wasn't). So it really comes down to analyzing through the knowledge I already have. And some common sense; when it tells me the run-time of a movie is 4 minutes, well, that can't be right.

AI: That's a great example of how you're using your existing knowledge and judgment to work with AI. It sounds like you've developed a good sense of when to trust the output versus when to verify.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Tasks that I've done plenty, know they work and why, and don't feel any need to refine further. I had to edit a morning exercise routine for a new employee today, and it seemed much easier to just make the changes myself. I was confident I could do it, and it felt like it'd be quicker. If I have to feed AI a lot of background info, it's probably not worth the time.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you're weighing the setup time against the benefit. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I ask some questions, get some answers, then have AI refine or clarify as needed. Then I'll finish and do it and it's done - or I'll coordinate with other humans, and go back and have AI help me refine it further.

AI: So it sounds like you're going back and forth with AI, refining things as you go, and sometimes bringing other people into the mix too.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues have no idea how to use it. I've tried to teach one person who does some of our graphic design; we do memorial photos for our deceased residents, and she put a lot of work into them. I found a much easier way to use AI to remove the backgrounds of their best images and replace them with clouds, and she was somewhat receptive to learning. But nobody else is. And frankly, I'd prefer that they not know I'm using AI for half the things I do. And the other half I think being able to use it makes me look smart (like having it write the movie descriptions); that's grunt work, not creative stuff, and it saves me an hour or so every month. So it's worth bragging about that. But for writing purposes or game or activity design, I'd rather my colleagues think that I'm doing it all myself.

AI: That's really honest - it sounds like there's a balance between wanting credit for efficiency gains versus wanting credit for creative work. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My boss was having trouble writing a letter to the families to describe all of our activities and events for the next month. AI did a great job with a rough draft, which I then refined a little to give it my own style, and when I presented it to my boss later that day she was very impressed - and she then gave me another writing task. Which AI once again helped me with - then she edited my answer, and after lots of back and forth we ended up very close to the original AI response. It was kind of pithy, but that was appropriate.

AI: That's a fascinating example - so the AI's original response ended up being quite good, even after all the human editing brought it back to something close to the original. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not particularly worried, because most of my skills have to do with running the events and activities; it's social, human-to-human interaction. AI can't replace that. If it helps me save time and do a better job at all the other tasks, that's fine with me. If AI takes over and I lose my skill at those things, then those things are no longer important to be skilled at. The only thing I worry about in that regard is whether my creative impulse will be dulled.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you're not worried about losing technical skills, but you are concerned about your creative impulse potentially being dulled.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I'll find a few more roles for it over the coming years and months.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance wanting credit for creative work versus efficiency gains, and your approach to verifying AI suggestions using your existing knowledge.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI into activity planning, writing tasks, and the social dynamics around AI use in your workplace will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciated your honesty about the different ways you think about AI assistance - from the practical time-saving aspects to the more nuanced considerations around creativity and workplace perception. Thanks again!
