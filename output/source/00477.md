Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: It sounds good, no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI to reference certain phrases from different cultures, such as Scottish sayings, to ensure that I am transcribing them correctly. I also use it to look up the meanings of foreign words, as well as ensure that I am spelling them correctly.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you work with multicultural content that requires accuracy across different languages and dialects. 

Tell me more about that work. What kind of transcription are you doing that involves these Scottish sayings and foreign words?

User: I transcribe and edit captions for movies, TV shows, and certain online content.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - accuracy would be crucial in that line of work, especially when dealing with cultural expressions that viewers might not be familiar with.

When you're working on captions with these cultural references or foreign phrases, are there certain types of content where you find yourself relying on AI more heavily than others?

User: Yes. UK based because they have regional dialects that each come with their own little phrases and terms that are not always familiar to me.

AI: I can imagine those regional UK dialects present some real challenges - each area has such distinct expressions and terminology.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think I could use AI to find what language a word or phrase is written in, but I tend to just look them up with voice on Google because I do not always know how to spell them. It is not something I do purposefully, really, I just forget I can use voice with AI as well.

AI: That's a really natural habit - using Google voice search when you're unsure of spelling. It sounds like it's more about your established workflow than a deliberate choice.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would say it's more of a collaboration.

AI: Tell me more about what that collaboration looks like. Can you walk me through a specific example of how you and AI work together on a captioning project?

User: So, as an example, if I was editing a caption that said "Ma heid's mince," I would first send that phrase to AI and ask if it was truly a saying somewhere. If it came back yes, Scottish, I would then ask what it means or any information pertinent to the phrase. I would do this so I could annotate that caption so another person that was working the file in the future would have that information readily available to them.

AI: That's a great example - I can see how you're using AI as both a verification tool and a research partner to build knowledge for your team. The annotation part is really thoughtful for future collaborators.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I do not have a "group" workplace environment, so unless I wait for an email response, it is quicker for me to find these things out on my own.

AI: That makes sense - working independently means you need immediate answers rather than waiting for colleague responses.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I am generally always satisfied. I have even had the AI correct my spelling and not have an issue with knowing the word/phrase I was intending. I would say a specific example would be me misspelling the word "yokoso" as "yukuso" and it correctly identifying my intented word.

AI: That's a great example of AI understanding context and intent even with misspellings. It sounds like that kind of intelligent interpretation really helps your workflow.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel as if my entire job-type could be taken over by AI as word recognition through different languages and dialects improve. For the most part, I use AI for what I can as of now, and will maintain my ability to type quickly, accurately, and study dictations.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - acknowledging the potential while focusing on the core skills that remain valuable. It sounds like you're adapting alongside the technology rather than avoiding it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe I could utilize it more in the future for audio recognition with voice when I am mishearing something.

AI: That's an interesting direction - using AI for audio analysis when you're having trouble making out what's being said. That could be really valuable in your line of work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that collaborative process of verifying phrases and then building annotations for your team - that shows a really strategic way of thinking about AI as a research partner.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for cultural and linguistic verification in captioning work, and how you've integrated it into your collaborative workflow, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
