Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Soinds good. Let's proceed.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm in real estate so I use Ai for a variety of tasks periodically throughout the day. Social Media ideas, data look up, creative writing for property descriptions, etc.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like AI touches several different aspects of your real estate work. 

Can you walk me through what a specific instance of using AI looks like for you? For example, when you're working on property descriptions, how does that process typically unfold?

User: For property descriptions I will typically enter a basic outline of facts about the property I want to highlight and then ask AI to create a decription that is less than 2000 characters and is mindfull of fair housing guidelines.

AI: That's a really practical approach. You mentioned being mindful of fair housing guidelines - that sounds like an important consideration in real estate.

Tell me more about how you decide which facts about a property to include in that initial outline you give to AI. What goes through your mind when you're putting that together?

User: I definitely include the basics of room count, levels, locations, lot size, property use etc. It's important to have the correct information to market the property. i understand that AI doesn't have that info so I provide it and then lean on Ai to write an appealing description.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're providing the factual foundation and letting AI handle the creative presentation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your real estate work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Definitely, I've chosen not to utilize any Ai assistance with follow up and client communications. I am not quite trusting enough in Ai yet to allow any communications to leave my desk in my name that are not first reveiwed and approved by me directly. I know many agents are using automated Ai systems for this and I'm just not there yet.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making. It sounds like there's something specific about client communications that feels different from other tasks like property descriptions.

What is it about those client interactions that makes you want to keep that direct control? What would need to change for you to feel more comfortable with AI assistance in that area?

User: I think I would need to feel confident that the answers/responses or prompts would always sound human-like and friendly. In real estate, our clients do hire us as individuals rather than as a company or entity, and I always want my clients to feel heard and well cared for during their process

AI: That really highlights the personal nature of your business - clients are hiring *you* specifically, not just any agent.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For something like those property descriptions, are you more likely to go back and forth with AI to refine it, or do you tend to give it your outline and let it handle the task from there?

User: I typically request at least 2 or 3 revisions but they are generally minor if I take the time to enter the prompt in a thoughtful manor.

AI: It sounds like you've developed a pretty efficient process - putting care into that initial prompt to minimize the back-and-forth.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other agents in your area using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: I live in a rather rural area and I think many agents here have been hesitant to adopt AI into their bussiness. The larger metros are ahead of us there for sure. But yes, I do know some who are using AI quite well in their businesses.

AI: That's an interesting dynamic - being in a more rural area where adoption might be slower.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sure, I recently had a listing where many repairs were needed, and I wanted to convey that without using alarming language, and the AI model had a hard time with that. It tended to want to either make the property sound like a complete fixer-upper or a turnkey dream house. After several back and forths, I just ended up writing that one myself. In that particular situation, I think knowing the target audience and messaging, along with having seen the property in person, was key to an accurate yet effective marketing campaign.

AI: That's a really revealing example - it sounds like there was something about that nuanced balance you needed that required your direct experience and judgment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do believe that the bulk of real estate will always require a human touch; it's a very emotional process for many. I'm trying to balance between letting AI do some of the behind-the-scenes tasks like marketing while I further develop my relationship skills.

AI: That's a strategic way to think about it - using AI to handle background tasks so you can focus more on the human elements.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you think you might be with AI integration in, say, a year or two?

User: I really hope to find more AI solutions to automate more of my social media presence. The tricky part is having the public and my clients not notice that it's AI. I have a quirky writing style and sense of humor, and I've struggled to get AI to write in a way for social media that could pass as my own content.

AI: That's fascinating - you want the efficiency benefits but need to maintain your authentic voice, especially when your personality is part of what clients connect with.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that balance between efficiency and maintaining the personal touch that's so crucial in real estate relationships.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we covered the key points Thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating that balance between AI efficiency and maintaining authentic client relationships - especially in a field as personal as real estate - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your specific use cases and challenges. Have a great rest of your day!

User: Same to you!

AI: Thank you! That was a really insightful interview. I appreciated how you opened up about your specific experiences and the thoughtful distinctions you make about when and how to use AI in your real estate work. Your perspective on maintaining authenticity while leveraging efficiency was particularly valuable.

If you have any questions about the research or would like to know more about our work at Anthropic, feel free to ask. Otherwise, thanks again for participating!
