Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a teacher. I use AI to help me write professional emails, to plan lessons, and to generate ideas on how to improve my students' scores.

AI: That's really helpful to understand. When you're using AI for those different tasks - the emails, lesson planning, and thinking about student improvement - can you walk me through what that actually looks like? 

For instance, when you're planning lessons, what does that process involve?

User: I ask for targeted lessons that are aligned to New York State learning standards. The lessons should be appropriate for the grade and subject area and include a rubric, success criteria, differentiated activities and opportunities for student engagement.

AI: That sounds like you're giving AI quite detailed specifications for what you need. When you get those lesson plans back with all those components - the rubric, differentiated activities, and so on - what happens next? 

Do you typically use what AI provides as-is, or do you find yourself modifying it in certain ways?

User: Sometimes I make adjustments because the plan may be too complicated to complete in a short period.

AI: Tell me more about those adjustments you make. What does "too complicated" typically look like, and how do you decide what to simplify or change?

User: For example, if there are 5 suggested activities I might cut it down to 2 or 3.

AI: I see - so you're streamlining the number of activities to fit your time constraints. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Right now I prefer to grade things myself. For example, even if I took a picture of my student's writing the AI may not be able to read the child's handwriting. Many of my students don't know how to type yet so I have to grade their essays myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the handwriting recognition issue and your students not typing yet creates some real practical barriers. 

Beyond those technical limitations though, when you're grading their work yourself, what else do you notice or pick up on that feels important to you as their teacher?

User: It is important for me to understand my students' cultural background and references when they are using writing to communicate. For instance, they might substitute a word in Spanish if they do not know it in English yet.

AI: That's such an important point - you're picking up on those cultural and linguistic nuances that are really specific to each student and their learning journey.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I usually like to collaborate and add my own insight to what the AI generates.

AI: Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like in practice? Like, walk me through how you and AI might work together on one of those lesson plans or another task?

User: For example, I had to generate an action plan on how to improve my students' math scores regarding certain standards. The AI gave me great suggestions, but I also added in my own ideas based on what programs and resources I have both online and in the classroom.

AI: That's a great example of how your on-the-ground knowledge about available resources shapes what AI suggests. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? What's the environment like at your school around using these tools?

User: The school culture promotes the integration of technology and AI into teacher development. For example, professional development courses on the topic of AI have been offered.

AI: That sounds like a supportive environment. Has that culture of promotion and professional development changed how you approach using AI, or influenced what you feel comfortable using it for?

User: The culture of promotion and professional development has made me feel very comfortable integrating AI into my practice and pedagogy.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time I needed students to respond to a writing prommt about a time a character was feeling very excited. They were instructed to use repetition in their response. I noticed that the students were struggling to get the idea, so I used AI to generate a short story as an exemplar. I think the short story was excellent and after reading it aloud to the students, they had a better understanding of what was expected. So this left me feeling particularly satisfied.

AI: That's a wonderful example of using AI to solve a real-time teaching challenge. It sounds like you recognized your students needed a concrete model and AI helped you create exactly what they needed in that moment.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't feet threatened at all by AI. I keep my skills sharp regularly by reading constantly and writing for fun. I also feel that AI can never be a nurturing and caring watchful teacher in a physical classroom. So I do not feel my career will be taken over any time soon.

AI: That confidence in your irreplaceable role as a nurturing presence is really striking. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: I just hope to use it more day by day. I can use it not only for my regular school day, but also for extracurricular clubs that I run.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI can't replace that nurturing, caring presence you bring to the classroom, and how you use it as a true collaboration tool rather than just delegating tasks to it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance AI assistance with your irreplaceable human skills as an educator will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you were in describing your collaborative approach and the ways you adapt AI suggestions to fit your classroom realities. Take care!

User: Take care

AI: Thank you! Have a great rest of your day.
