Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my typical work day I use AI to navigate my calendar and tasks

AI: That's interesting - using AI for calendar and task navigation. Could you tell me more about that? What does that look like in practice for you?

User: In practice, I need to be extremely careful because of confidentiality and data breaches so I quickly type in some generic information ie "check email, team meeting, return releases" and have AI organize it for me.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach to balance utility with confidentiality. When you say you have AI organize these generic tasks for you, what exactly does that organization look like? How does it help you structure or manage those items?

User: Typically it helps to give an overview of the time I should be taking to complete the tasks and scheduling breaks to ensure I am focusing when I need to be.

AI: So AI helps you with time estimation and building in breaks - that sounds like it's helping you pace your day better. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are a tonne of tasks I could be using AI for but unfortunately in the insurance world, it is too risky for data breaches. My workplace would not allow me to input details

AI: That workplace restriction around data security really shapes how you can use AI. Given those constraints, when you do use AI for work - like with your calendar and task organization - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it the generic information and let it handle the organization independently?

User: I typically give it very generic information and let AI handle it independently. Too much interaction can give to many details

AI: That makes sense - keeping interactions minimal to maintain that security boundary. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others approach it similarly, or have you seen different strategies?

User: I've seen others approach it similarly and others not at all. The company itself is slowly moving towards using AI to search provider databases and it seems successful overall. I am interested to see how it progresses.

AI: That's fascinating that your company is piloting AI for provider database searches while maintaining strict boundaries elsewhere. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The way I use AI at work and the infrequency of use I do not find myself feeling a particular way - good or bad. It is a useful tool but I am just as content without it.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing it as useful but not essential. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As someone who works primarily at a desk, it is something I have thought of definitely. However, I like to think of it as a tool rather than something that could be used to replace my job exclusively. Just like there are automated expresso machines - you still need a human to maintain it.

AI: That's a great analogy with the espresso machine - the human element for maintenance and oversight. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think those security constraints might change, or do you see yourself continuing with this more limited approach?

User: I think they may change slightly but not exclusively. I foresee myself continuing with a limited approach, at least for the next little while as everyone learns more about AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on viewing AI as a tool rather than a replacement, and how you've navigated the balance between utility and security constraints in the insurance industry.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so. I believe in my line of work security will always be the first thing that comes to mind.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working within strict security constraints while still finding practical uses for AI - and that balanced perspective on AI as a useful tool rather than something essential - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
