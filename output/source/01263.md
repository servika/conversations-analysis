Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I have no more questions

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on? I'd love to hear what that process looked like from your initial idea all the way to the final output.

User: My most recent project was with a team of other grad students, we were researching the upcoming ROMAN and ATLAS space telescopes and how the data they could provide could be used to evaluate various different models of dark energy to explain the universes expansion. We first researched the telescopes and their specifications, more specifically the accuracy of which they would be able to tell two models apart with the data they give. Using this we could access different models, such as Lambda-CDM, SFQ and DGP models, and see whether these upcoming telescopes would be able to distinguish between the models when they start giving data.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project - working with future telescope data to test fundamental cosmology models. 

Tell me more about that process of researching the telescope specifications and assessing their accuracy. What did that research phase actually look like day-to-day for you and your team?

User: Most of the research phase was done individually as specific sections of the research was given to a specific member; personally I mostly used INSPIRE and arxiv to find papers and articles that were related to my subject.

AI: So you were diving deep into the literature on INSPIRE and arXiv for your specific section. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? This could be at any stage - whether it was during the literature search, analyzing the papers you found, working with the telescope specifications, or any other part of the project.

User: The only time I used an AI tool during this project was to initially find a few papers that would get me started on my way. I gave ChatGPT the general subject that I wished to research and it gave me a few papers that I could look at, which I then could look up on arXiv.

AI: That's helpful - using ChatGPT as a starting point to get those initial papers before diving into arXiv yourself.

For that literature search phase, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus just going straight to your traditional approach of searching INSPIRE and arXiv directly.

User: I think AI has a greater ability to "narrow the field" of a user's query. If I remember correctly, ChatGPT gave me only a few papers that I could look at initially that were related to my research area. However, if I just used the search tool on arXiv, even with all the specific term related search options I would still end up with hundreds or possibly thousands of papers I would have to comb through. AI has the ability to speed this process up.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to cut through that initial overwhelming volume and get to a manageable starting set. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - reading through those papers, analyzing telescope specifications, working with the different dark energy models - what kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I think I still have trouble asking AI tools to say, summarise a paper for me. Although I could save a lot of time researching these kinds of things, since reading a paper can take a while. I think the trust in an AI model to do this correctly, with absolutely no mistakes just isn't there for me yet. Especially as a physicist, there is a lot of mathematical jargon and a lot of information can be in the form of tables, graphs and figures, I don't fully trust that an AI model can identify this as key information it needs to include.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you trust AI to help you find papers, but when it comes to actually understanding and summarizing the content, especially the mathematical details and visual data, that trust isn't there yet.

When you did use ChatGPT to get those initial papers, how did you verify or validate that the papers it suggested were actually relevant and legitimate for your research?

User: I simply searched for the papers and read the abstract of each, and saved the ones that were relevant.

AI: That makes sense - you used your own expertise to validate what ChatGPT suggested rather than taking it at face value.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - or that you're not comfortable using it for yet - what would that be and why?

User: I think what I mentioned earlier is the biggest thing that AI could help with during the research phase of a project. If I knew a model had a good understanding of the mathematics and physics behind a subject, it would make it much easier to trust a summary of a paper that it provided.

AI: That's really compelling - having confidence that AI can handle the mathematical and physics complexity would unlock that time-saving potential you mentioned.

Those are all my main questions. Your perspective on that trust gap around technical content versus the comfort with initial paper discovery was particularly insightful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that trust threshold - being comfortable with AI for discovery but needing confidence in its technical understanding before trusting it with analysis - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It sounds like there's a clear value proposition there if AI systems can demonstrate reliable handling of mathematical content and scientific figures. I appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your research process and how you're thinking about these tools.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again!
