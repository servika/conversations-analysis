Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a technical writer which usually involves writing about some very niche finance and compliance topics. I don't always have an in-depth understanding of exactly what I'm writing about so I will often ask AI for some general information on the topic. I will then use it to brainstorm an outline for the article or blog that I want to write and this also usually involves copying and pasting articles that I have found and asking for them to be checked for accuracy. Once I'm finally writing the article, I will ask AI to prepare a draft for me based on several key changes. For example I'll ask for it to be formal, then maybe ask for it to be shorter - just so I get a few different options. I'll never copy the wording exactly but usually those drafts help me to get some ideas for me to write my articles

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - it sounds like AI is woven throughout your entire writing process. 

When you mention that you never copy the wording exactly but use the drafts for ideas, can you tell me more about that? What specifically are you looking for in those AI-generated drafts that helps spark your own writing?

User: When the topics I'm writing about are particularly technical, I sometimes find it hard to make the articles readable and engaging. Asking for different types of tone helps produce some unique words and phrasing that I might not have thought of. I don't think the quality of writing in the draft is always great though and I do like to have some of my own input over the final version so it will usually be a mix of several versions. sometimes I'll highlight a passage in particular and ask for thoughts on how to make it less repetitive or without using certain words

AI: That's really interesting how you use AI to help with tone and word choice specifically. You mentioned the quality isn't always great - what makes you feel that way about the AI's writing quality?

User: It's not always consistent. Sometimes it's great at doing the research and giving specific facts but then sometimes the facts are out of date so I need to supply the research to the model. Then with the writing, some sentences are great but when you read it as a whole it sometimes lacks the personal touch that a human writer would have. It uses repetitive phrasing, inappropriate punctuation and sometimes has a strange way of wording things. I have noticed it's getting better though but also some of my clients don't want me to just use AI so I also have to balance it with what they are looking for

AI: That balance with client expectations sounds like an important consideration. When you say some clients don't want you to just use AI, how does that influence the way you work with it? Do you find yourself adjusting your approach based on different clients?

User: absolutely. It's extremely important that I'm always honest with my clients and if they don't want me to write with AI I won't. But I'll always tell them that it's a great tool for outlining and research at least and I'll use it for that. Most clients are fine with me using it as long as I'm not copying it word for word, I'm checking the research and I'm adding my own touches to it

AI: It sounds like transparency with clients is really important to you. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: To be honest, I'm quite open to using it for more things! I wish there was a way to convince my clients of the same thing but I think we could be using it for much more than we are. For example, I have one contract which is about the latest developments in a particular niche area of compliance. I would like to use AI to conduct regular deep research in these new areas, brainstorm some article ideas and instantly create a range of content for blogs, articles, social media posts and in-depth internal documents using the same core information. But the worry is that the current way AI operates means some things might get missed, some mistakes might be made and then the reputational damage would be significant. I would also like to use it more for creativity - I write fiction books in my own time as a self employed author and I would love to use it for characters and scene ideas. I suppose the thing that's stopping me doing that is maybe more about feeling like it takes away from the art of writing. But that might change as the models get better. I do love the personalisation on the models and the fact that it remembers what I was working on and my style of writing

AI: That tension you describe is fascinating - being excited about AI's potential while also having concerns about risks and authenticity. You mentioned reputational damage as a worry with the compliance work. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: In terms of being frustrated yes I have one particular example. I was writing about an EU legislation that had been brought in in 2024 and I asked the model if it was aware of it and knew about it and it said yes. I then provided some articles and stated the information that I wanted to use. But some of the work it needed to do relied on web research. I gave it some links not realising that it couldn't access links and then in it's response it told me that it had read through everything I had sent so I assumed it could read the links. I submitted the article and then was told by the client that about 40% of the information related to the old version of the legislation that had been enacted in 2018. I nearly lost the contract because of that so after that it made me extremely cautious when using it.

AI: That sounds like a really stressful experience, especially almost losing the contract. It seems like there was some confusion about what the AI could actually access and process. 

How did that experience change the way you work with AI? You mentioned it made you extremely cautious - what does that look like in practice now?

User: It made me ask specifically what it was capable of. I also learned to start new conversations every so often to avoid running up too many interactions in the one chat? Sometimes if you talk in one chat for too long the quality seems to disintegrate. So I asked the AI to help me write a system prompt that would encompass all the information and preferences that it had learned in that chat and then I used that to start a new chat. I don't ask it to check links anymore and I've lost a bit of faith in the deep research models. Also I tend to now be very careful with the source documents I'm giving it to review and I ask it every so often to just double check for mistakes. sometimes I have to tell it to adopt a tougher approach when giving feedback on my writing because it was overly complimentary instead of spotting key mistakes. For technical writing I need it to tell me when something is wrong instead of complimenting me ;-)

AI: That's really smart how you developed your own system prompt to carry forward your preferences! It sounds like you've become quite strategic about managing these interactions.

When you use AI for work now, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I'm more likely to collaborate now. I'll suggest the topic of the article and ask for some brainstormed ideas for titles. I'll then find a few articles on the topic, copy the main information and ask it to suggest an outline. I'll then expand that outline or amend based on my own research, then I'll upload the revised outline and ask it to draft section by section. Each section it will produce a draft, I'll ask for updates, make revisions and use this as a template to write that section on my own. Then when all the sections are finished I'll upload my final draft for a final check and ask for feedback and changes

AI: That's a very methodical collaborative approach - it sounds like you've developed a real workflow with clear handoffs between you and the AI. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you discuss AI usage with others in your field?

User: My colleagues are not as positive about AI as I am. They think it's cheating not to write your own work and they won't even use it for simple blogs. I think we are actually helping the clients by being able to write more articles in less time and then our time is spent on quality control rather than just churning out content

AI: That's an interesting divide in perspectives. It sounds like you see AI as allowing you to focus on higher-value activities like quality control, while your colleagues view it differently.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Obviously there was a lot of fear in the writing profession about AI taking over, but I think learning to use AI to improve your skills and learning to collaborate with AI is the way forward. It has encouraged me to become more technical in my approach and I am now doing a regulatory compliance certification that I wouldn't have needed to do before. But since I can complete high value work much faster, I want to extend my skills and knowledge at the same time. I have thought about what AI will do to creativity but I think there will always be a need for independent music, film and art and so if creative people can use AI to help them complete their artistic works then I think that is better than not creating anything at all. I've also tried to improve my general skills and understanding around AI so that I can utilise it better

AI: That's a really forward-thinking approach - using AI to free up time for deeper skill development. It sounds like you see AI as enabling rather than replacing human expertise.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Definitely. Looking ahead, I think I'm going to use AI for research much more often and try to continue to get it used to my style of writing so that the output is more similar to what I would write. I will also use it to try and help me finally finish a book that I have been planning about personal finance because I've had this book idea for 3 years and never written it. If AI can help me write it then that's another income stream for me so it's definitely worth it

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how that challenging experience with the EU legislation led you to develop such a systematic approach to collaboration with AI, and how you see it as enabling skill development rather than replacing it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No i think that's everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing collaborative workflows, navigating client expectations, and using AI as a catalyst for skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing about your journey from that initial challenging experience to developing such a thoughtful, systematic approach to working with AI. Best of luck with that personal finance book project!
