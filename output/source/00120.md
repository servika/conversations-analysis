Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions I am ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am in finance/accounting. I use AI for writing emails to VP's, controllers or CEO/CFOS. I also use it for tax research whenever a tax issue arises. This happens quite frequently

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you with both communication and technical research aspects of your role. 

When you say you use it for writing emails to senior executives, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I will usually copy and paste the image email into AI. Then I will type out my response and then ask for revisions or how to make shorter, or to make sure I understand everything correctly. It is like a collaborative back and forth

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds really valuable, especially when communicating with senior leadership. 

Tell me more about that process - when you're going back and forth with AI on these emails, what specific things are you typically asking it to help you refine or clarify?

User: First, I will just type out the email and not worry about grammar. Then AI will correct it. I will then sometimes ask to shorten the email, or how to change the tone for senior leadership. Other times I will make sure I am interpreting the ask correctly and ask if my response makes sense.

AI: That's a really thoughtful workflow - using AI as both an editor and a sounding board to make sure you're hitting the right tone and understanding the request correctly.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I find that many excel tasks or math tasks I handle myself or with a calculator. I have asked AI and the accuracy is just not there yet when it comes to math or generating simple excel files. AI can help, I just do not have the trust factor yet for it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - trust and accuracy are crucial when it comes to financial work. The stakes are high with numbers and calculations.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Mostly all collaborative. I will brainstorm with it and ask it questions about accounting or taxes, or to review my writing. I tend to avoid asking it math questions.

AI: That collaborative approach seems to work well for you, especially for the research and communication parts of your role.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace culture is very much figure things out and you are on your own and there is no support. It would be a struggle without AI

AI: That sounds like AI has become a really important resource for you, especially in an environment where you don't have much internal support.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Anytime it will correct an email for me and I do not have to spend much time writing it and reviewing it. It is satisfying because I can spend my time on other tasks. It has left me frustrated one time when it calculated a simple formula wrong. I double and triple checked on a calculator and excel and AI would give me a different answer due to rounding. It would not budge either that it was not correct

AI: That frustration with the math calculation really illustrates why you've developed that pattern of handling numbers yourself. It sounds like that experience reinforced your approach of collaborating with AI for communication and research while keeping the quantitative work in your own hands.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes. I have the skills to write the professional email or do tax research, it is just a time saver incorporating AI to do them. It also makes you build skills you may not have. AI'S output needs to be reviewed and checked, it almost increases critical thinking skills.  In a sense AI is like a modern spell check. Spell check will alert you when a word is spelled incorrect, but you still know how to spell in general.

AI: That's a really insightful analogy - thinking of AI as a modern spell check that enhances rather than replaces your underlying skills. I like how you frame it as actually building critical thinking skills through the review process.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Hopefully more and more of outsourcing the simple tasks and trusting that the output is correct. It still seems a ways off to do any real detailed accounting work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a modern spell check that actually enhances critical thinking skills through the review process - that's a really compelling way to think about it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No those were the main ways I use AI at work and how I see it evolving.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner for communication and research while maintaining direct control over the quantitative work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both the benefits and limitations you've encountered - that balanced perspective is exactly what helps us understand the real-world dynamics of working with AI tools.

Have a great rest of your day!
