Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: At the moment, I do not currently use ai at my job very often. At most I will occasionally use it to help with ideas about how I can try and make my baked goods better at the bakery where I work and help run.

AI: That's interesting that you work at a bakery! When you do turn to AI for ideas about improving your baked goods, what does that process look like for you? Walk me through a recent example of how you used it.

User: I work at a specialty bakery that focusses on the Keto diet. This means that we make a lot of recipes from scratch or have to find clever work arounds for regular recipes. Often times, these recipes fail and it isn't always clear why. For example, there have been bread recipes that we've tried that should have worked, but didn't rise the way that was expected. I've used AI to help troubleshoot these problems in the past with mixed results.

AI: Tell me more about that troubleshooting process. When you bring a failed recipe to AI - like that bread that didn't rise properly - how do you typically interact with it to work through the problem?

User: In that example, I gave it a list of the ingredients that we used and explained the issue to the ai. Unfortunately in that case, the ai didn't quite understand what made a keto bread keto and suggested that the issues in the recipe was due to a lack of flour.

AI: That sounds frustrating when the AI missed such a fundamental aspect of what you were working with. How did you handle that situation, and has that experience shaped how you approach using AI for recipe troubleshooting since then?

User: In that situation, we just ended up not following any of the advice from the ai and just tried more trial and error in the bread making process, eventually finding a mix of ingredients that worked the way we wanted ourselves. Honestly, it probably made us less likely to interact with ai assistants in the future if issues like that were to happen again.

AI: That makes complete sense - when a tool doesn't understand the core constraints you're working within, it can feel like it's not worth the effort. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned using it occasionally for baking ideas - are there certain tasks in your bakery work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI might be able to help with them?

User: There are other tasks such as the creation of promotional material and menus that could be aided by the use of ai, but we have not used any ai tools so far in their creation. This is due both to not knowing where the datasets is taken from to  create these promotional art pieces as well as trying to avoid any mistakes or irregularities which might be present in them.

AI: That concern about not knowing where the datasets come from is really thoughtful. When you think about creating those promotional materials and menus without AI, what does your current process look like? What works well about doing it yourselves?

User: Right now I'm mostly in charge of making menus and promotional art since we are a very small team  and most of us have several roles.  Right now, this mostly consists of me taking photos of some of our products and using the limited graphic design skills that I have along with some online tools to help me make menus or art for the store.

AI: It sounds like you're wearing a lot of hats in a small operation. When you're juggling all these different roles - from recipe troubleshooting to photography to graphic design - how does the workplace culture or your team dynamics influence whether you reach for AI tools or stick with your current methods?

User: While I am the person in charge of running most of the bakeries day to day operations, I only have a small stake in the company. The majority owner would have final say in whether we  ultimately use ai for a project of some kind. I do have input on what I think would be the best choice in each scenario however. Often I will simply use whatever method worked best in the past since I don't always have the time to be trying new approaches.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - sticking with what works when time is tight. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? It sounds like that bread troubleshooting experience was frustrating, but I'm wondering if there have been other moments that stood out to you emotionally?

User: Honestly I cannot think of any times where ai has been particularly helpful to me. There have been a few other times I've used it besides the time I mentioned previously. One time, I tried some of the built in ai art features in an art program I use for making promotional art, but it was not really usable at that time and I was better off just taking pictures of our actual products and making all of the artwork by hand.

AI: It sounds like you've had a few attempts with AI that haven't quite delivered what you needed. Given these experiences, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas like graphic design or recipe development? Is preserving those hands-on abilities something you actively consider, or does it just happen naturally?

User: I have gone out of my way in the past to take online courses for graphic design to help out with running the bakery that I work for.  Beyond that most of my skills just come from the work place.

AI: That's great that you've invested in developing those graphic design skills through courses. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue with your current approach, or are there circumstances that might change how you interact with these tools?

User: Right now I don't see me using ai too often at my work place. Perhaps I would consider using it in the future if I was more confident in its abilities and didn't have to worry about the ethical concerns of where the datasets of ai art tools came from.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the practical realities of running a small specialty bakery - from time constraints to ownership dynamics - shape your approach to new tools, and your thoughtful consideration of both the capabilities and ethical concerns around AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't have any other things to share.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working in a small specialty bakery and the real-world challenges of integrating AI tools - from understanding specific dietary constraints to managing ethical concerns - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty about both the limitations you've encountered and the practical considerations that guide your decisions. This kind of feedback is invaluable as we work to understand how AI fits into different work environments.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
