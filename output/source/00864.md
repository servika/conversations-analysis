Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! Away we go.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI in my daily work routine to discuss recipes, analyze product use/efficiency and track customer satisfaction/routines.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you work in a food-related business. Can you walk me through what a specific interaction might look like? For instance, when you say you use AI to discuss recipes, what does that process actually look like in practice?

User: I work as a pizza maker for a local Pizza restaurant that makes quality in house pizza. One chat I've had with AI was regarding material cost and usage. I explained the dilemma I had regarding management's orders versus a process that I had discovered that I thought would be overall more beneficial to the business and the customer. I described the product I was making and gave the AI a full rundown of the ingredients and their exact quantities. I then described the yield of the end result and asked the AI to compare the process that management had laid out for me versus the process that I had developed. My goal was to determine if the process I was using was actually more lucrative and satisfying to customers. I was using more ingredients to create the product but I was also getting a higher yield and wanted a full cost/benefit analysis from the AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to use AI - bringing it in to help analyze a real operational challenge you were facing. What did you discover from that analysis? Did the AI's breakdown help you understand whether your process was actually more cost-effective, and what happened next with that information?

User: I discovered that my hunch was correct. By using more cheese and garlic in the garlic knots, not only did the product taste better to customers - increasing customer value, feedback, return rates, etc., it was also adding more yield in to the amount of knots I was making on one tray. I discovered that the material cost of the extra product used was substantially outweighed by the ROI of the end product, resulting in an additional est. $15,000/year in profit. The AI not only used the figures I had given it regarding material usage and cost, it also factored in its own relevant information to create a full analysis and breakdown of the cost/benefit to the consumer and business, including generated graphics and charts to accompany the information. I then took this information to my managers and explained my positioning. As a result, my managers allow me to create the garlic knots using the process I have developed. Business is always messy and tradition is hard to break so they have not shifted their own process to reflect mine but at least I am not able to create a product that I can personally stand by without getting backlash.

AI: That's a remarkable outcome - $15,000 in additional annual profit is substantial for a local restaurant. It sounds like the AI didn't just crunch your numbers but brought additional context and presented it in a compelling way with visuals.

I'm curious about that moment when you decided to bring this analysis to your managers. What was it like presenting AI-generated data to support your case? How did they respond to the fact that you'd used AI as part of your reasoning?

User: They were impressed. Although I had used the AI as a means to compile and compute a large amount of information, the information I fed the AI was of my own collecting and I believe this factor aided in their understanding. They responded positively to my findings and as I was using the AI to verify and compute the math behind my investigation rather than using it to create the scenario to begin with, I believe they were more apt to take the information in a favorable manner. In other words - If I had simply used the AI to tell me the most efficient way to create the product without any trial and error of my own, I believe they may not have been receptive to it, but because I used the AI as a means to verify my own information and rough math, It legitimized the use of AI substantially.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - using AI to verify and analyze your own observations versus having it generate the solution from scratch. It sounds like you positioned yourself as the expert who gathered the data and AI as the analytical tool.

Are there other types of tasks where you prefer to handle things yourself first, even though AI could potentially help? What makes you decide when to bring AI in versus when to keep working on something independently?

User: Generally speaking, I use AI when cooking and creating recipes as a means to provide inspiration and suggestions regarding techniques rather than providing full-blown step-by-step instructions. I often ask AI about the different ingredients I am using as a way to inspire me in a certain direction regarding what I might create with it, but I never follow the instructions as they are laid out, rather take the idea and run with it. For me, A - in a creative sense - is good at providing the initial inspiration of a direction to take a task in. Maybe I have broccoli, carrots, potatoes and ground beef and I've thought of making a soup but AI suggested adding cream to make it a more rich mixture - that sort of idea.

AI: I love that approach - using AI as a creative collaborator for inspiration rather than instruction. It sounds like you see it as a brainstorming partner that can suggest directions you might not have considered.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have that back-and-forth collaboration throughout a task, like with the recipe inspiration, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently, like you did with the cost-benefit analysis?

User: I prefer to have a more back-and-forth approach similar to having a conversation with an intelligent friend or teacher. The back-and-forth approach allows me to navigate the problem/solution in a more natural way. The AI may present it's case or lay out its findings and reasoning but I am bound to have questions, comments or corrections about its statements, so having an open dialogue is key to achieving the result I am after. Furthermore, the natural conversational style grants me leniency when communicating with it so that I don't always have to get hung up on semantics or presenting my questions/comments in a hyper professional or specific manner.

AI: That conversational flow sounds really natural - like having a knowledgeable colleague you can think out loud with. The flexibility to not worry about perfect phrasing seems important for keeping that dialogue moving.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do others at the restaurant use it differently, or has there been any discussion about how AI fits into the business?

User: My colleagues do not use it to my knowledge, they are content running the business as it has always been run. Additionally, there has been no discussion related to using AI in the workplace even though I believe that it could streamline several processes in large ways. It doesn't seem like there is any motivation on their end at all to incorporate it let alone conversations about it.

AI: It sounds like you're kind of pioneering AI use in your workplace on your own. That must create an interesting dynamic - you're finding ways to improve processes and solve problems, but you're doing it somewhat independently from the rest of the team.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The situation involving the dispute about my garlic knot process felt very satisfying to me. I had a hunch that my process was beneficial to the business and had voiced my feelings regarding the situation but was not prepared to do all the math myself to figure it out so I used AI to do the heavy lifting in that sense. Presenting my findings that I was able to obtain through the use of AI felt very rewarding, I finally had my idea validated.

AI: That validation must have been incredibly rewarding - especially when it confirmed your instincts and led to real change in how you could do your work. It sounds like the AI gave you the analytical firepower to back up what you already sensed was right.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: In relation to pizza making and handmade pizza making at that, I have no concerns of AI replacing my work. The business and managerial side of things is a completely different beast though, I can see AI augmenting a lot of work in that field. Scheduling, ROI analysis based on incoming/outgoing product and analyzing customer trends could all be done by AI.

AI: That's a really practical way to think about it - recognizing where the human craft element is irreplaceable versus where AI could handle more analytical tasks. You seem to have a clear sense of where your expertise as a pizza maker remains essential.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself finding new ways to use it, or do you think you'll stick with the current pattern of using it for analysis and creative inspiration?

User: I think if anything, I'll most likely use it in a similar fashion, a sort of "call-and-response". I have an idea about a product or process and use AI to determine if my thinking is on the right track. I wont be using AI to create new products or replace my expertise, but I can use it as a right hand man to do the heavy lifting of crunching numbers and analyzing or presenting data in a way that can give me insight to my processes at work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a "right hand man" to validate and analyze your own expertise rather than replace it - and how that positioning helped your managers accept the findings.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that about covers it! Thanks for the chat, It was interesting to me to engage about it as well. Great questions.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about finding that sweet spot between human expertise and AI analysis - and how you've navigated being an early adopter in a more traditional workplace - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It was really enlightening to hear how you've carved out this collaborative approach with AI while staying true to your craft. Thanks again, and best of luck with your continued innovations at the pizza shop!
