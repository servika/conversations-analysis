Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm ready to begin!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I work on creating inspiration and client-facing artifacts for housing remodel. This includes interior and exterior remodeling. I work with with contractor managing the job to create mock-ups to present to the client with design inspiration and remodeling options. Some of examples of exterior remodeling could be changing paint colors, railings, or landscaping while interior could be updating design concepts or reworking internal room dimensions.

AI: That sounds like really engaging work - helping people visualize their space transformations before they commit to the changes. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Currently AI only fits well into the preliminary stages of my work. I use AI to brainstorm ideas for different design choices using images, creating images of what theoretical rooms could look like and creating mood boards with different ideas to give clients a lot of variety.

AI: Tell me more about that brainstorming phase. What does that process actually look like when you're using AI for those images and mood boards?

User: For example, my most recent use was creating options for exterior railings. I was given multiple pictures of the exterior of a home and my job was to create a portfolio of images of different railings on each angle of the house to give the client a book of options to choose from. AI models in the design space are still somewhat limited. They couldn't complete the job of pasting railings onto a house without altering the original picture significantly, but I did use them to give me examples of railings on coastal houses with similar themes. I took those AI inspiration railings and found realistic images that I was able to photoshop onto my original pictures for client mock-ups.

AI: That's a really interesting hybrid approach - using AI for inspiration rather than final execution. Can you describe a bit more about what happens when AI alters the original pictures too much? What kinds of changes does it make that don't work for your purposes?

User: I've tried multiple different AI models and each have similar limitations. For my purposes, clients want to see what these different design choices look like on their exact house. When AI models are generating, they often struggle with instructions to only change specific artifacts in an image and instead change the entire image. For example, when I use the prompt "change the exterior railings from aluminum to wrought iron, use a design popular on high-end coastal vacation homes, do not change any other aspect of the image, the rest of the house should stay exactly the same" I will receive back a new AI generated home, possibly with the correct railings but usually with distorted proportions. If I was starting with a blank canvas, the generative AI models would be very helpful. The issue is that the current generation will change the structure of the house significantly so that it's not the same as original photo. This creates images that aren't what the client is looking for so I can't use them for end stage design presentations.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the client needs to see *their* house with the changes, not a similar-looking house. So when you're working with AI in that brainstorming phase, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions when you're gathering those railing inspirations?

User: Typically I'm driving the design process but there is collaboration involved. I have ideas of the type of themes a client will like and what they will automatically veto. I use that information and market research on trending design themes to request certain styles and design choices to create an image portfolio or mood board for certain rooms. When I get stumped I'll tap AI and provide an image and ask for ideas of themes to try in different scenarios. From that brainstorming I'm usually able to go to the web and find realistic images I can use to photoshop into my original images.

AI: That's a helpful dynamic - using AI almost like a creative sounding board when you hit those stuck moments. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: It saves me time by helping to narrow down design options. For example, if I ask for examples of "high-end exterior coastal railings" I can get an idea of what I like and dislike. Then instead of browsing through tens of web pages looking through hundreds of pictures for any railing designs that are coastal-adjacent, I can quickly scan pages to find what I need for resource images. The generation from the models doesn't always come out realistic, often is slightly animated, but I've also had luck using Google lens to direct me to real images that are similar to the AI provided ideas.

AI: That's a smart workflow - using AI to help you identify what you're looking for, then finding the real-world versions. It sounds like you've found a way to work around some of the current limitations.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: AI is going to be a field disruptor for anyone in the remodeling space. I'm not someone who is professionally trained in this field but I have enough knowledge of AI manipulation and passable photoshop skills to be able to advise design choices on a remodeling project of a $3 million house. For my personal needs, most of the models could've produce what I needed but if someone is using it to creating generative images from scratch the outputs are very impressive. I can easily see someone paying about $30/month to create design inspiration for a new house versus paying significantly more for an interior designer in person. Although there are financial levels to this industry. Meaning, someone who could originally afford an interior designer might be someone who doesn't care to do the work and would pay to have it outsourced anyway. That high-end market will likely always be there. I see interior designers working on mid-low range projects being the first ones affected once this technology is more easily accessible.

AI: That's a really thoughtful analysis of how the economics might shift across different market segments. You mentioned that you're not professionally trained in this field but you're able to advise on significant projects - that's quite a testament to how AI can democratize certain capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As AI gets better I'd like to see it able to incorporated further down my production line to create full mock-ups. It's still new enough that I forget to use it sometimes for things that it could've made easier or faster but for the most part I've pushed the limits on what it can do for me. In the future, once the models are able to separate and manipulate individual aspects of an image I'd like to be able to provide thorough prompts of what I want changed in an image and receive exactly what I asked for. Photoshop is nice but it takes time and I'd like to see AI evolve in the image space to expand how I'm able to precisely edit images.

AI: Those are all really insightful perspectives you've shared about your experience with AI in design work. I particularly appreciated your point about how AI is democratizing access to design capabilities, and your realistic view of both its current limitations and future potential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered my pain points as well as its current uses.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative brainstorming partner while working around its current limitations, and your perspective on how it's changing the accessibility of design work across different market segments, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you walked me through your hybrid workflow - using AI for inspiration and then finding real-world resources to create the final client presentations. That kind of practical adaptation is exactly the type of insight we're hoping to understand better.

Thanks again for participating in our research!
