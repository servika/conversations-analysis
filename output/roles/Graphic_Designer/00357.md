Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for research on handiman/maintenance projects, to help write promotional copy for my business, our graphic designer uses it to make promotional flyers/digital ads, I use it to help speed up internet research on various random topics that come up, and more too I guess

AI: That's a really interesting range of uses across different aspects of your business. 

When you mention using AI to help speed up internet research on various random topics - can you walk me through what that looks like? How does AI change your research process compared to how you might have done it before?

User: unless I need to be 100% of detailed or nuanced information, a quick ai response to a Google search usually has the answer i'm looking for. So I guess this means that the ai is scouring the internet for me, saving me time

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having AI do that initial scouring work for you. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned that unless you need to be 100% detailed or nuanced, you'll go with the AI response. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: for some things, the ai response may not be factually accurate, so if it's important i'll be sure to find sources to confirm (or disprove) the ai answer. I definitely prefer to handle customer interactions myself, as I'm not sure if I trust ai enough to take the right tone, read the situation correctly, and work together with the customer for the solution

AI: That's really insightful - the distinction between tasks where accuracy is critical versus those where you need that human judgment and relationship-building.

When you do use AI for work - like for those promotional copy projects or handyman research - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, going back and forth, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: definitely collaborate. the first response is not generally precisely what I need. This varies depending on the request i've inputted, but sometimes I'm not sure the best way to input what I really need (or possibly not even sure what I really need) without first gaining some of the information/materials presented by the ai at first, even if it's not quite what I really needed.

AI: That's a fascinating dynamic - using that first AI response almost as a way to clarify your own thinking about what you actually need. It sounds like the collaboration helps you refine not just the output, but your own understanding of the task.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned your graphic designer uses it for flyers and ads - has working together shaped how any of you approach these tools?

User: yeah, since I realized that our graphic designer was just using AI, I've realized that she is not choosing to think on her own about projects very much at all. I have to imagine that i'm actually prompting the AI myself, so I have to be very clear and specific with what I ask from her, as I imagine she is just copying/pasting it into some sort of ai. really ought to just skip the middleman, to tell the truth.

AI: That's a really telling observation about how AI can change working relationships in unexpected ways. It sounds like discovering her heavy reliance on AI has shifted how you communicate with her entirely.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm not sure that using AI at work makes me feel PARTICULARLY satisfied or frustrated. Mostly, it just heightens/improves what I can do with one of my tools - my computer.

AI: That's an interesting way to frame it - as an enhancement to your existing tools rather than something that creates strong emotional reactions. It sounds like AI has become fairly integrated into your workflow in a practical way.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not, not at this point. AI can tell me how to install the TV mount into masonry, but it can't actually do it for me. I don't really need to worry about remembering that information for a long time, since AI can just tell me again when I need to know again. AI can write decent copy, but unless I curate it/edit it precisely, it will appear a bit uncanny/not quite right to our clients. So, I still need to know how to write and how to communicate, AI just makes me more efficient

AI: That's a really practical perspective - AI as a tool that enhances your efficiency rather than something that threatens to replace your core skills. You clearly see the boundaries of what it can and can't do for your specific work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing much from how you're using it now?

User: Nah not really. not at my current job

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as an enhancement to your existing tools rather than something that creates dramatic changes - and your observation about how it's affected working relationships with colleagues who use it differently.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a practical tool enhancement, the importance of maintaining human judgment for customer interactions, and how AI adoption can unexpectedly change colleague dynamics will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
