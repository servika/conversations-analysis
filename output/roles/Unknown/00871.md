Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I speak to clients who are blind or low vision, so often when I search the internet for answers for them (about any number of topics, including tech troubleshooting, product queries), the first answer that comes up will be the Google AI summarizing answers. Often, I read that to my clients when it seems correct and relevant and let them know that I am reading the AI generated response. I also write reports about select clients, and I use AI to polish my notes about mine and my colleagues' sessions with them.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI both for real-time client support and for documentation. When you're reading those Google AI summaries to your clients, how do you decide whether the information seems correct and relevant? What do you look for to make that judgment?

User: I look for hints that it is correct, such as the steps it says to take making sense. For example, if I search how to set up email forwarding in Outlook, I am looking for it to have similar keywords to what I am looking at in the program. If it says to click on "My Account," but the link reads "Account," I'll likely move on to another source, as any deviation from the truth compromises my trust in the answer.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're essentially doing real-time fact-checking by comparing the AI's instructions against what you can actually see in the interface. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Some of my colleagues use AI to describe photographs, particularly of people, if they feel uncomfortable doing so. For example, it can be uncomfortable to try and describe a photo of 10 men, and they're all wearing suits and have similar haircuts, but they are of different races that are not readily apparent to me. I don't prefer to use AI in these instances; instead, I will ask my client what they are looking for. In this particular example, they might tell me that they are looking for a graduation photo of their son, and their son is of Indian decent and has long black hair that he wears in a ponytail. I can then let them know whether I can see their son in the image based on that description.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - you're choosing the human connection and direct communication over the AI tool in situations that involve personal meaning for your clients. It sounds like you're prioritizing getting the information they actually need rather than a general description.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate throughout the process. I used to do some side work transcribing contact lists, and for that, much of the work I gave to AI to do independently and did not collaborate with it on fact checking. However, I did feel compelled to check each and every entry, as I often found errors. It was still a time-saver, as I didn't have to type everything myself.

AI: So it sounds like you've experienced both approaches - collaboration for your main work with clients, but more delegation with follow-up verification for that transcription work. It's interesting that even when delegating, you felt you needed to check every entry.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: The company I work for is integrating AI into our work processes. Clients now may speak with an AI visual interpreter (my job title is visual interpreter). A live human visual interpreter surveys 100 percent of these sessions currently, and it very often makes mistakes. However, I still think it is a worthwhile tool that many clients may feel more comfortable using than a live person for certain tasks or in certain environments. 

Since my company is embracing AI, I feel comfortable using it as a collaborator in my workflows, both when providing live support and completing my reports.

AI: That's fascinating - so your company is actually piloting AI to potentially do the core work you do as a visual interpreter, while you're simultaneously using AI as a tool to enhance your current work. The fact that you're surveying those AI interpreter sessions must give you unique insight into AI's capabilities and limitations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Once, while working on a report, Google Docs' AI automatically populated an executive summary for me. I looked it over and edited a few things and included it in the final document. I got praised for it. That was satisfying. However, I am most often frustrated with AI when using it beyond collaborative writing. In AI sessions at work, frequently the AI will give blatantly incorrect instructions and information, and often it will insist it is correct when prompted if it is sure.

AI: That's a great contrast - the satisfaction of AI seamlessly helping you create something that got recognized, versus the frustration of AI being confidently wrong when you're relying on it to help your clients. The fact that it insists it's correct when challenged sounds particularly problematic in your work context.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: From what I've seen of AI's capabilities thus far,  I don't foresee my position being threatened anytime soon. As a human, I am capable of greater reasoning, understanding, empathy, and other uniquely human traits that AI still struggles with. Also, for many of my clients, speaking to me is one of the few or is the only time they speak to another person for days or weeks. I think that a human connection is important, and I also think that my concern and genuine empathy are great tools in assisting my clients.

AI: That's a really compelling perspective - you're seeing the human connection and empathy as core, irreplaceable parts of what you do. It sounds like you view the relationship aspect of your work as just as important as the technical assistance you provide.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think AI will continue to get smarter and more useful. I foresee myself using it more frequently for troubleshooting tasks and for summarization tasks. I also foresee the AI interpreter becoming more useful. It is currently in alpha testing, so its limitations are to be expected.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on choosing human connection over AI description for personal photos, and how you balance AI assistance with the need for accuracy when helping your clients.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we about covered it. I think AI is a great tool, but it certainly still (and always will, I think) have some limitations that make human connection irreplaceable.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI capabilities with human judgment, especially in a role where accuracy and empathy are both critical, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear from someone who works so directly with people who depend on accurate information, and who also has firsthand experience observing AI attempting to do similar work. Your perspective on the irreplaceable value of human connection really stands out.

Thanks again for participating in this interview!

User: Thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
