Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I have no questions and am ready to start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a voiceover artist, and use different types of AI for different jobs. I use some AI tools for adjusting audio (cleaning up files by removing background noise, dynamic EQ adjustments; things that would take a while to do manually, but AI can do reasonably well very quickly). I tend to use LLMs for writing assistance: if I have a script that needs to be rephrased, I will run the script through an LLM to give me suggestions for alternatives and to ensure that my final script doesn't contain any mistakes like logical contradictions, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across different parts of your creative process. 

When you're working on those scripts and getting suggestions from LLMs, how do you typically work through that process? Are you going back and forth with the AI to refine ideas, or do you tend to get a batch of suggestions and then work with them on your own?

User: It depends on the project, but I will usually manually read through a script first to pinpoint points where changes are needed. I often find that I need to provide the LLM with a brief overview of the project so it understand the concept, but then I will provide the section I wish to rework, asking for some alternative phrasings that maintain the same tone, level of clarity, and meaning. Occasionally I will need to clarify exactly what it is about the original I don't like, as this can help steer the model in the right direction for what I want. Out of those suggestions, there may be elements from one that I like, but the general phrasing choices of another are better, so I will provide some feedback to help refine the suggestions. Usually, once I have a suggestion that is close enough to what I want, I will manually do any final tweaks to get it perfect.

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful collaborative process. You mentioned doing those final tweaks manually to get things perfect - I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your voiceover work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: For the final tweaks, usually it's due to it being easier for me to adjust it manually, as it would be as much effort to tell an LLM what to specifically do as it would be for me to go and edit the text myself. These changes are usually when I know exactly what it is I want to change, as I often use these AI models more for idea generation and suggestions. If it is something as straightforward as changing a single word, I may as well do that myself. 
There are some tasks (specifically the audio adjustment kind) where the AI tool's results may not be exactly as I wish, and it requires a human ear to identify what needs to be adjusted, how, and to what extent.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI more for the ideation phase when you need options, but keeping control when you know exactly what you want or when it requires that human judgment.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other voiceover artists in your network using these tools, and has that shaped your approach at all?

User: I'm self employed, so don't have any specific colleagues or workplace, but I do talk to other voiceover artists. I think it generally depends on their level of tech-literacy. Some prefer the tried-and-tested methods that they have been using for years/decades and don't see the point in using new tools. Others have a distain for anything AI so won't touch it, but I can understand that thinking due to the negative impact AI has had on many voiceover artists over the last few years (the number of smaller to mid-budget jobs have reduced due to companies using AI voiveovers). Others are more open to embracing it, seeing it more as a tool than a threat.
The main thing is how the clients view AI; as there has been public pushback over larger organisations using AI voiceovers, clients want a voiceover that sounds authentically human, which in turn can make voiceover artists want to seem a bit more publicly distanced from the technology.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's this complex tension where AI can be useful as a tool for your process, but there's also this professional reality of how clients and the industry view AI more broadly.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: For satisfied, I think it was probably the first time I considered using an LLM for getting help rephrasing something. I was working on a script for a localization project that was translated into English; due to this, the phrasing uses throughout was clumsy, awkward, and inauthentic. I had spent a while manually rephrasing things, but due to the length and complexity of the subject matter (the script was quite technical and required some external research to ensure that what I was saying was still accurate), it was a bit frustrating and time-consuming. At that point in time, I'd only very lightly dabbled in using an LLM, so didn't know how helpful using one would be for that specific task. I believe that I provided a few minutes worth of text at a time and told it to rephrase everything while maintaining the meaning and accuracy, and it did a fantastic job straight away, saving me hours of work. I still had to check everything, but it saved me a lot of frustration.

AI: That sounds like a real breakthrough moment - discovering that the AI could handle that complex rephrasing work while you maintained oversight of the accuracy. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your work as a voiceover artist?

User: Knowing the state of the current technology, there are a few areas in which I wish that AI would catch up with my expectations (honestly, a simple tool that I could use for adjusting a single word or line of dialogue would be a game changer!). I feel that it is important to to have a solid understanding of the current AI tools, because they are only going to get more prevalent (almost every new VST effect plugin boasts some kind of AI integration). If I could have a locally-run model that is trained off my own speech patterns while producing authentic sounding audio, I'd fully embrace this, but I still feel we are not quite there with that technology.
As I said earlier, I feel that clients still value authentic voiceovers, but I'm not overly worried about AI collapsing the industry as I believe there is a lot of nuance that can't be fully replicated.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - staying informed and even anticipating better tools while recognizing the unique value you bring.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally?

User: I'd hope that in the future, more niche tools will become available (preferably locally-run applications) that can help speed up my workflow, as editing can often be the most tedious part of the process, I'd be willing to embrace anything that helps with that. I think that for the industry in general, people will start to see AI as a tool rather than a treat. If it can continue being helpful (and get even more helpful over time), then I can see the relationship getting closer.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you use AI more for idea generation and suggestions rather than final execution, and how you navigate the industry tensions around AI while still finding practical value in these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that covers everything

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing the practical benefits of AI tools with the professional realities of your industry will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've found that sweet spot of using AI as a collaborative partner for ideation while maintaining your expertise and judgment for the final touches. Thanks again!
