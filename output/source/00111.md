**Transcript ID:** AI: That planning process sounds crucial to your work. When you mention wanting to create something ""unique and stands out from competitors in the top search results

---

" how do you approach that? What goes through your mind when you're trying to find that unique angle?

User: First, I think about what questions readers might have that the top-performing pages aren't answering or any way I can integrate personal experience or concrete examples to make the topic more applicable to the reader. I've had a past client suggest these types of approaches in an effort to make more human-centered content.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Most of the time, I am collaborating with the model for research, planning, and revision purposes as I'm working on each of my articles. I rarely fully delegate a task, besides something like drafting feedback for writers based on key findings I noted or sending an email to explain an issue to a client.

AI: That collaboration approach you describe is interesting. When you're working with AI during that research and planning phase, how do you typically structure that back-and-forth? Do you have multiple exchanges with the AI, or is it more of a one-shot request and response?

User: I have multiple exchanges during that phase. For example, if I'm writing about mortgage rates, I might first prompt the AI to give me a rundown of how mortgage rates work and what they are currently. That way, I have a basic understanding of the topic in mind. Next, I'll prompt the AI again to generate an article outline based on the goals that I or my client has set for the project. Then, I'll likely prompt the AI again to note some important statistics or research to include in the draft.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Many of my colleagues in the journalism field have taken a position against AI since they fear it will take away their jobs. Additionally, many clients limit how we writers and editors are allowed to use AI, often to research and planning. However, my position has been that AI can help me do my job more efficiently, so I want to take advantage of the technology as much as possible.

AI: That's a really interesting dynamic. When you say your colleagues have taken a position against AI out of job concerns, how does that play out in your day-to-day interactions with them? Do you find yourself keeping your AI use more private, or are you open about how you're incorporating it into your workflow?

User: I work remotely, so thankfully my colleagues wouldn't know about my AI use like they would if we were in the office. I do keep it more private, mainly because I've heard of other writers being falsely accused of generating their articles with AI, even though they wrote the drafts themselves.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently, I had to write a content brief for an article topic that doesn't have much traction yet on the web, so I find it a bit of a nightmare not being able to do a true competitor analysis since articles didn't yet exist. AI saved my day since it was able to give me an outline of what were the key points to address. From there, I could do further research to create a more thorough outline.

AI: That sounds like AI really came through for you in a challenging situation. On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling frustrated? What happened in that case?

User: Yes, I needed to include a complex mortgage payment calculation in an article that discussed how much a person would need to earn to afford a home.  I kept getting contradicting numbers since the AI was making various assumptions, such as the interest rate and down payment, and it also seemed to ignore that personal finance factors come into play. Honestly though, this problem would be hard even for a seasoned professional, but it was frustrating.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have definitely started focusing on improving my domain-specific knowledge and tech skills. I have a financial and tax background with some computer science skills mixed in, and I find myself interested now in more technical topics, such as data analysis and coding.  I do feel uncertain about the future overall, but I hope to still provide value to employers and clients.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe that my clients will become more open to allowing writers to use AI to create drafts and that my role could shift more toward AI editing and fact-checking than simply writing articles.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've developed that systematic verification process to catch AI errors, and how you're proactively building skills in more technical areas.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, nothing at this time. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing collaboration with AI while maintaining creative control, navigating workplace dynamics around AI use, and adapting your skill development have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
