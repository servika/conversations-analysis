Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure!  I don't have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a personal trainer, so I often use AI to generate meal plans with given macros, or to create workouts based on specifics I provide (i.e. "I need a 3 day a week strength workout for a beginner using no gym equipment)

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helps you create customized content for your clients. 

Tell me more about how you work with AI when creating these meal plans and workouts. Do you typically give it all the parameters upfront and let it generate something complete, or do you find yourself going back and forth to refine what it creates?

User: I start with parameters, and then fine tune as necessary.  For example, to continue with the prompt above "I need a 3 day a week strength workout for a beginner using no gym equipment," I will look through the suggested exercises and might make adjustments like "I need a little bit lower intensity," or "this person has a history of shoulder instability so let's avoid overhead presses."  These are things that I wouldn't automatically put in upfront, but would be come apparent as needing to be edited based on AI's response.    Meal plans are quite a bit trickier, and I do find myself giving a lot more direction up front, and also a high level of edits after the inital response.  I might say something like "Give me three days worth of meal plans with approximately 2000 calories a day.  Keep protein above 100 grams, and prioritize carbs over fat for remaining macros.  This person is allergic to shellfish, and avoids dairy."  This will give me a good template to start from, and then I will either make a few minor adjustments going back and forth with the model, or if it looks like the changes will be significant, I'll copy paste into a new document and make the edits that way, since it will be faster, especially when some models lose track of the conversation and start making mistakes.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow you've developed. It sounds like you've learned to anticipate where AI will need more guidance versus where it can handle things independently.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of creating these workout plans or meal plans that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: For some specific people, I prefer to do the creation of these things entirely myself.  Some people have a specific "vibe" to them, and I know what exercises and foods are most likely to be appropriate (and appreciated by the client).  For example, I know that my highschool football player isn't going to want to do clam shells as a warm up, and will appreciate lifts that look cool.  This nuance isn't something that is well handled by AI.  Similar examples are clients with movement limitations beyond really basic stuff, like my shoulder example above.  Interestingly enough, it's different if I'm trying to research something like "my client has injury x.  Which shoulder exercises are likely to help support their PT goals?"  There, AI does a really good job.  It's just if it's mentioned within the larger context having AI generate a workout plan AND keep in mind this specific injury, I'm only going to get really basic modifications, if that, and I'll probably have to explicitly direct those changes.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making - between AI helping with research versus handling the full context of a specific client's needs and personality.

When you do choose to work with AI for creating plans, could you walk me through what that collaboration typically looks like? Are you more likely to work with it step-by-step throughout the process, or do you tend to get an initial output and then take it from there on your own?

User: I do tend to get an initial output and then work from there.  I find that sometimes too much information right off the bat can not only be too time consuming for me, but can lead to errors from the AI.   So I will start with something basic, like the examples above, and then tweak as necessary.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping that initial interaction focused to avoid overwhelming both you and the AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other trainers you know approach it similarly, or have you noticed different attitudes toward using these tools?

User: There is a real fear in our industry that people will no longer pay for personal training and coaching because they will be able to get the same information from AI.  I don't see that happening, because the information about nutrition and exercise is already out there on the internet, so people theoretically have had access to this for a long time, and there is also a level of personalization that might be challenging for people to do on their own (think of a former athlete that has unrealistic training load plans...a good trainer would see this and be able to modify accordingly, and that's not something AI would do on it's own.  There is a difference between having the information and being supported in implementing it, and the person-to-person connection in training is vital for motivation and troubleshooting.   So I'm pretty open about using AI as a tool, but tend to stress the human component for where the real "magic" of personal training happens.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on how AI fits into the broader value you provide as a trainer. The distinction you're making between information access and actual implementation support is really interesting.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I recently had a pretty complicated client (menopausal, numerous food sensitivities and preferences) and needed a meal plan that was going to support their hormonal health and overall wellness.  For this particular person, this meant ensuring adequate dietary fat while avoiding foods that triggered gastrointestinal issues.  It just seemed to be too much for the AI to hold at once, and the first attempt was off in terms of total calories, when I pointed that out, the second attempt fixed the calories but allowed one of the trouble foods in, and then when I asked for another edit, put together a meal with ingredients that didn't even make sense to put together, just to fit in the macro allotment.  This back and forth went on for awhile until I finally quit.  It was frustrating to spend that much time on something, to have it get more convoluted as the conversation went on, to finally just scrapping the whole thing and doing it by hand.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially when you're trying to balance so many specific constraints and the AI seems to be losing track of them as you go. It really highlights that challenge you mentioned about models losing track of the conversation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's not something I actively consider, no.  There is a certain point where AI will be able to hold all those complicated constraints, and will be able to generate meal plans and workout plans accurately and faster than I can, which will be a helpful tool and not worth fighting against.  What I think most about is how to strengthen my interpersonal skills, so when that happens, it's not an issue, because my professional value is in the supporting and coaching, and not being a human nutritional calculator.

AI: That's a really strategic way to think about it - focusing on strengthening the uniquely human aspects of what you do rather than trying to compete with AI on the calculation side.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as these tools continue to improve?

User: I'll continue using AI for sure.  It (usually) helps me save time, and as it gets better and saves me even more time, that's time that I can use to coach more clients, work on my own professional improvement in other areas, or even just relax.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've learned to navigate AI's strengths and limitations, especially that distinction between using it for research versus full client planning, and your strategic focus on strengthening the interpersonal aspects of your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've developed workflows around AI's capabilities, and especially your thoughtful approach to where human expertise remains irreplaceable, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: You're welcome!

AI: Thank you so much! That was a really insightful conversation. Have a great rest of your day!
