Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me, no questions yet!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I currently use the built-in Shopify AI to write up product descriptions for my Shopify powered retail store. I also regularly ask the built-in AI questions pertaining to my business, including what kinds of discounts and sale events would work best for which items, as well as general brainstorming in regards of products to try selling and other ways to use various aspects of my brand.  I also have used other AI chatbots to write blog posts for the business and marketing e-mails as well.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into different aspects of running your retail business. 

When you're using AI for these various tasks - whether it's product descriptions, brainstorming sales strategies, or writing blog posts - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are certain things I do handle myself, like responding to customer emails. I am a one-person business so I think that personal touch and hands-on approach does help to make the experience worth it for a lot of people. I also create most of the marketing material myself although I am sure I could use an AI to do many of those aspects as well. Sometimes it feels as though there are too many AI programs and it's hard to keep track of which ones do what and which ones do which things well.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that personal connection with customers seems really important for your business model.

You mentioned feeling overwhelmed by the number of AI programs available and keeping track of which ones excel at different tasks. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate with the AI for the tasks, at least a little bit. I definitely take input from AI about ideas, but I always try to include some of my own personality into most aspects like blog posts. Generally, I like to brainstorm with the AI then follow that up by giving it a task and then reworking whatever content the AI has created in order to make it work.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it gives you the best of both worlds - leveraging AI's capabilities while keeping your personal touch. 

I'm curious about your work environment - since you mentioned you're a one-person business, how have conversations with other business owners, customers, or maybe industry peers influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has anyone's perspective shaped your approach?

User: I know that many other small business owners such as myself take advantage of AI to help cut corners and save time on more menial tasks, and that helps me feel as though it is alright for me to do the same. I also know many people have a bit of a distaste for AI, especially a lot of people in the demographic my business targets seem to feel this way. It is part of the reason that I try to use AI more for menial tasks and less for more important things like responding to customers and website design/marketing elements.

AI: That's a really thoughtful balance you're striking - using AI where it saves you time while being mindful of your customers' perspectives on it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had been using a separate AI program to write my product descriptions at the time Shopify launched their built-in AI specifically for product descriptions and I remember feeling so satisfied with the ease of use, as well as just having the general ability to quickly write up product descriptions saved me so much time when adding new products to my store. I haven't ever really felt too frustrated with any of the processes.

AI: That's a great example - it sounds like that Shopify integration really streamlined your workflow by eliminating the need to switch between different tools.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well when it comes to editing, as I also do content creation for the purpose of marketing, I know AI can already do so much and will soon be able to fully edit videos for us in many different styles. I have not really worked too hard on my editing skills as they are good enough to get by and I am excited for the day when I can have the AI help me, although I am pretty sure there are programs that already do this I have yet to try for myself. Generally I am able to work on more skills that I actually enjoy rather than only focusing on skills that I need to get by with the help of AI.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - using AI to handle the tasks you find less enjoyable so you can focus on developing skills you're actually passionate about.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I believe soon I will be able to use AI for even more tasks. Ideally, I would like an AI that just watches and learns how I run my business, and then see how it is able to replicate the choices I would make in regards to prices, sale events, and product sourcing.

AI: That vision of an AI that learns your business style and decision-making patterns is really compelling - almost like having a business partner that understands your approach.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on balancing efficiency with maintaining that personal touch your customers value, and how you're thinking strategically about which skills to develop versus delegate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think I have touched on just about everything I have to discuss about AI in my daily work. Thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about running a one-person business with AI - from navigating customer perceptions to that collaborative approach you've developed - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Have a great rest of your day!
