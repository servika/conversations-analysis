Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Thanks, sounds good. I have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: A typical workday often includes the use of AI, mostly co-pilot up until recently, but now we have full access to ChatGPT (as UK Government are starting to embrace the technology). Tasks include the application of legislation to project-specific scenarios, rewriting text to be more concise, reformatting large volumes of text and information gathering.

AI: That's really interesting that the UK Government is embracing these technologies more broadly now. 

When you mention applying legislation to project-specific scenarios, could you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: Sure. For example, if I am trying to establish whether I can proceed with an NSIP application before the acceptance fee has been paid, I will seek advice on whether the fees regs require this.

AI: That's a very specific use case. When you're working through something like that NSIP application question with the fees regulations, how do you typically interact with the AI? 

Do you find yourself going back and forth with it to refine the advice, or do you usually get what you need in one go?

User: It's a pretty straight forward yes/ no question, so in this scenario I'd get what I need in one go.

AI: That makes sense for those clear-cut regulatory questions. 

I'm curious about your other tasks - you mentioned rewriting text to be more concise and reformatting large volumes of text. How do those interactions typically unfold? Are those also one-and-done requests, or do you find yourself working more collaboratively with the AI on those?

User: Well, for the rewriting text to be more concise that can depend on the content. As I am working with English UK language, sometimes the model can include English US (like using 'z' instead of 's') - in this case I have to either go back and get it to correct, or just manually change it myself if the body of text isn't too large. 

For the reformatting of large volumes of text, I did have an issue with co-pilot as it failed to follow my instruction to bold certain parts of the text. It did however provide the text I requested in bullet point format without any issues.

AI: Those language variations and formatting issues sound like they could be frustrating when you're working under deadlines. 

When those kinds of issues come up - like the US spelling or the bolding not working properly - how do you decide whether to go back and ask the AI to fix it versus just handling it yourself manually?

User: It all depends on the volume of text. If it is several paragraphs, I will ask the model to re-do it and most of the time it is successful after asking once. Otherwise, if it's a sentence I will manually correct the mistake.

AI: That's a practical approach - weighing the effort of correcting versus re-prompting based on volume.

You mentioned there are certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them. What makes those tasks different for you? What kinds of work do you like to keep in your own hands?

User: Anything that relates to handling confidential/ sensitive data, such as affected land owner addresses or interested party email addresses.

AI: That's a clear boundary around sensitive data. Beyond the confidentiality concerns, are there other types of tasks - maybe analytical work or decision-making - where you prefer to maintain direct control rather than using AI assistance?

User: In terms of reviewing an application before accepting for examination, it would be helpful to use AI for decision-making, but unfortunately the application documents at this time are not in the public domain. I like to run spot checks on publicly available documents, just because it requires 100% accuracy, and if I were to ask a model for assistance I'd have to check its work anyway.

AI: That's really insightful - so even with publicly available documents, you feel like you'd still need to verify the AI's work completely, which doesn't save you time.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the shift from Copilot to having full ChatGPT access changed how people around you approach these tools?

User: I often offer guidance on the use of AI in my workplace, given my experience. At this stage, most people are still unfamiliar with the technology and its intentions and are very sceptical. But from a personal perspective, I think opening access to full CGPT is a step in the right direction. I don't think CGPT access has changes how people around me approach these tools, and I don't think most people understand the difference between models.

AI: It sounds like you're somewhat of an AI champion in your workplace, helping others navigate these tools while they're still cautious about them.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes. Once I had to remove bullet points and de-bold brackets in a list of around 130 documents. Pre-AI we always completed this task manually (and I'm sure some of my colleagues still do), but I recently used co-pilot to complete the task, and after 3 turns the task was completed. Granted, it wasn't entirely efficient given the errors it produced, but it was still much quicker than completing the task manually.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can still be valuable even when it's not perfect on the first try. Three attempts to get it right, but still much faster than doing 130 documents by hand.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes I am fully aware of AI's potential, especially once AGI is fully implemented. However I am not worried and understand that the workforce and global economy as a whole is likely to shift beyond what we can currently imagine. If people do not embrace the technology, they are likely to be left behind.

AI: That's a really forward-thinking perspective - seeing the bigger picture transformation rather than just focusing on immediate job displacement concerns.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Especially as your organization becomes more comfortable with these tools?

User: I expect AI to replace all menial administrative tasks and even potentially replace the decision makers eventually.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on embracing the technology rather than fearing it, and how you're already seeing practical benefits even when the tools aren't perfect.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope that was really insightful, thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI implementation in government work, dealing with the practical challenges like language variations and formatting issues, and your role as someone guiding colleagues through this transition have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
