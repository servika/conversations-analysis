Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I have two types of creative work. The first is creating images for adult coloring pages. They are more intricate than a child's coloring page with more detail. For instance, a realistic dragon sleeping in a forest surrounded by trees, fairies, crystals, and hidden images amongst the leaves. So, a project would be taking a creative scene in my head and turning it into an image of black and white lines with no shading. The second is writing creative passages for use in social media. They are short passages but very specific in their theme and tone. A project would entail focusing in on a message that I want to convey and wording it most efficiently without losing the tone. I then might put that message to music and imagery to create a "reel."

AI: That's fascinating - you work across both visual and written creative mediums. I can picture those intricate coloring pages with all those hidden details, and the challenge of crafting those precise social media passages sounds quite different but equally creative.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I have more creativity in my mind than in my hand so AI helps me in that regard. AI is very helpful for creating coloring pages. I have the scenes in my head but I do not have the talent to put that scene onto paper. As far as creative writing, sometimes I have a message that flows but sometimes I can't seem to get it across eloquently. AI's creative writing is fantastic. It can help me put my thoughts to paper, or reword more eloquently, or shorten a passage for social media.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - having more creativity in your mind than in your hand. It sounds like AI is helping bridge that gap between your vision and execution.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: For coloring pages, I recently requested the dragon sleeping in the forest as well as a few other images, like a sitting Buddha and a fairy in flight. I allowed some creative freedom for the AI when I requested the images such as 'surrounded by trees and crystals and other magical objects' and I built off of what AI offered in the image. It felt fun at times and frustrating at times if the AI did not understand the feedback. For creative writing, I recently asked for a short passage (although longer than a social media reel) with a very particular tone of invoking the dragons out of dormancy to activate the Earth's ley lines (darn it I can't find it right now) and I needed help creating an eloquent passage. I was floored by the results. It was so on point with my intention.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you had quite different experiences with AI across those two projects. The writing result that floored you sounds like it really captured what you were going for with the dragons and ley lines theme.

Tell me more about that frustrating part with the coloring page feedback. What was happening when the AI didn't understand what you were looking for?

User: The request is always for a black and white line image. The image I received had some partial shading in it. I requested the AI remove the shading but it just could not seem to do it. It seems that sometimes when an image is already created, the AI has difficulty editing the image. It might even elicit more errors outside of what you requested. Sometimes it's easier to just start over but that can be frustrating when you had a great image but then the AI makes a new creation that is missing parts you liked from the first one. Admittedly, I would probably be getting better results with AI that is more specialized in image creation and/or higher level paid subscriptions. I am still playing around with all different AIs for image creation.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like there's this tension between getting something close to what you want but then struggling to refine those specific details, especially when it comes to editing existing images.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I feel like I am driving the creative decisions but I feel like AI provides excellent collaboration and can spark more creativity for me.

AI: That's a helpful distinction - you're in the driver's seat but AI is acting as that collaborative spark.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Oh! I feel like it opens me up to endless possibilities.

AI: Tell me more about that - what do you mean by endless possibilities?

User: For instance, instead of creating just a coloring page, I can expand to create a passage with the coloring page; the dragon invocation along with the dragon image. Prayers along with Christian images. Affirmations alongside meditative images. This leads me to brainstorming what else I could create along those lines. Also, I feel like I can create social media faster when I don't have to spend time struggling with getting the words out.

AI: That's really compelling - it sounds like AI is helping you create these richer, multi-layered experiences rather than just single pieces. And the efficiency gain with social media seems to free you up for other creative exploration.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I do have concerns about taking work away from artists. I could find an artist to hand draw the images I want but on a budget even a subscription for AI is more realistic.

AI: That's a thoughtful concern - the economic reality versus the impact on other artists. It sounds like you're aware of that tension between accessibility for your own creative work and the broader effects on the artistic community.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As I continue to experiment with different platforms I hope to find one that works well for me for line images and edits. If I fine tune that then I will probably have more creations than I can keep up with! For creative writing, most AIs are great at it. I will absolutely continue to use AI to help me get the words out. I see AI's role being a permanent part of my creative future.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps bridge the gap between the creativity in your mind and getting it into tangible form, and how it's opened up those endless possibilities for creating richer, multi-layered projects.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative collaborator - from helping translate your mental visions into coloring pages to finding more eloquent ways to express your messages - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how honest you were about both the exciting possibilities and the practical challenges, like the frustrations with image editing and the concerns about impacts on other artists. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
