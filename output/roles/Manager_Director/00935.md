Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: It's really random the things I use AI for. I work as a nanny and house manager. I do a lot of research. It could be anything from asking for a way to explain a complicated topic to and 8 year old to researching state laws on required safety training for schools. I use it heavily to manager my daily schedule. I have set it up to know exactly what needs to be done for each work day and then each morning I log on and have it give me my usual tasks and I fill in all the extras I might have for the day. I have daily, weekly, monthly tasks that I want to be reminded about. 
I use it frequently to research for the household, for example, I needed to find a specific sized console so I had it compile me a list of potential items. I use it to create educational materials for my 1st grade charge. Most recently I have asked for help on how to explain the Catholic faith to a 6 year old and also how to explain that someone has cancer and may die.

AI: That's really interesting how you've integrated AI across so many different aspects of your work - from the daily task management system you've set up to handling those really sensitive conversations with children.

Tell me more about that daily schedule system you mentioned. How exactly does that work for you?

User: My standard tasks are already in the memory, I add on any additional tasks given to me each day. Then it creates a list for me that includes emojis to make thing interesting. I have asked the Ai to push to get things done on both my work and personal to do lists, so it always asks if I want a couple of quick wins and suggests which tasks to start with.

AI: That sounds like a really personalized system you've developed. I'm curious about something you mentioned earlier - you said you use AI for everything from daily scheduling to explaining complex topics to children. 

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I have not connected my calendar to AI yet, it's something I have not felt comfortable doing but I really should. I would like a more complex look at my work week and home time. Also sometimes I have personal appointments or tasks during the work day that I need to attend to and have an ai buddy to keep me on track would be nice.

AI: So it sounds like you're still working out the boundaries of what you're comfortable having AI access to. 

When you are using AI for work tasks - like creating those educational materials or researching household items - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a request and let it handle things independently?

User: Good question. it is usually a very back and forth process especially when I am researching products or travel plans. Once I am satisified with my research materials I have it collated into a PDF that I can present to my employers. If it is education materials, I refine the data until I have what I want. Although I did encounter a very frustrating time once while trying to create a 5 day mini course I wanted to use during the summer. No matter how I worded things I could not get the product I wanted so I abandoned that project.

AI: That abandoned summer course project sounds frustrating. What was it about that situation that made it so difficult to get what you wanted, even with all the back-and-forth refinement?

User: I wanted to create an etiquette course with an instructor's manual, flash cards, crossword puzzles, and a bunch of other things. Every time I would finish an interaction it would ask if I wanted it create all these other things and I would say yes because they sounded helpful but the product that was given was not professional nor useful. 
I thought of another project I abandoned but will try again with. I had created lists with suggestions for hundreds of housecleaning prompts, I wanted it to add them to a list and randomly suggest items each day but I wasn't finding the correct wording to make it work.

AI: Those experiences really highlight the challenge of getting AI to understand exactly what you're envisioning. It sounds like there's sometimes a gap between what it offers to create and what you actually need.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you work as a nanny and house manager, I'm curious how the families you work with view your AI use.

User: I think they were a little skeptical of it at first. To be honest, sometimes I don't tell them explicitly that I have accomplished a task via Ai, I just let them know the project is done.
My employers have really random requests, though, and in the past it would take me hours to compile and present the research and now it can be done in minutes when I find the right way to ask for things. They are a little slower to join the AI train but I am easing them into it.

AI: It sounds like you're navigating that balance of showing the value of AI while being mindful of their comfort level. You mentioned that your employers have "really random requests" - that's an interesting way to put it.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well since I already complained I'll tell you about a more successful interaction. My employer wants to redecorate a room in her home. With just a few keywords to guide me I was able to present multiple ideas to her. This included space planning that showed the actual room with suggested furniture, color suggestions, multiple websites to look at and purchase the items.

AI: That sounds like a really successful outcome - being able to go from just a few keywords to a comprehensive presentation with space planning and purchasing options. That must have been satisfying to pull together so efficiently.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: At this point in time, the nanny part of my job is safe from AI. My charge has very limited screen time so most of my interactions are personal ones with her. At this time, the family is somewhat reluctant to embrace newer technology themselves. They don't have a smart home besides their thermostat. They know that I am very comfortable with being online and researching so they default a lot of things to me. I could see AI taking over in schedule one day. The family still uses a paper calendar systems for a lot of things. If they had a central screen in the home that managed all of their schedules and calendars they would eventually use it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on how different parts of your role have different levels of AI integration potential. The personal interaction aspect with your charge does seem quite different from the research and management tasks.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I want to get better at prompting AI so I experience less frustration and am able to produce the things I want. I am eager to know about things I could do with AI, I feel like I am not using it to its full potential. One thing I look forward to is having ai be that reminder throughout my day the same way I get notifications from events on my google calendar.

AI: Those are all really valuable insights. You've shared some thoughtful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work - from the daily task management system you've developed to navigating those more complex projects, and how you're gradually introducing your employers to AI's possibilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I wish there were some courses on each ai platform that would not only walk a new person to AI through the process, but also ones that would provide some advanced insights on how to work on projects and get the most from AI. Right now it seems like when I log into AI it's like the wild, wild west and anything goes. I guess I would like a bit more structure. Not sure that makes sense, but I often get the feeling I don't know what I don't know.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the "wild, wild west" description really captures that feeling of having this powerful tool but not necessarily knowing all the ways you could be using it more effectively. The idea of structured learning paths, from basics to advanced project techniques, sounds like it would address that "don't know what I don't know" challenge.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've created that personalized daily task system and how you're thoughtfully navigating the integration of AI with your employers' comfort levels. 

Your insights about wanting more structured guidance and advanced prompting techniques will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
