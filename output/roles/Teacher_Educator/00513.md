Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I do not have any questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for personal queries which I would have normally tasked a search engine with. For work, I use AI to create email bodies which I then edit and also to mass edit documents.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI for both information gathering and content creation. 

When you mention mass editing documents, could you tell me more about what that looks like? What kind of editing are you having AI help with?

User: When I wrote my students' report card comments, I used pre-written templates which were gendered "they". I asked AI to replace "they" with the names of each student from a list and to correct the grammar for the comments. I have also used AI for translations of legal documents.

AI: That's a really practical application - sounds like it saved you quite a bit of time with those report cards. The translation work for legal documents sounds like a more specialized use case too.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anytime I use AI to create something which will be customer facing (ie: email, lesson plan), I make sure to do my own edits as well so as to add my personal touch to it. I use synonyms, delete sentences, create new sentences and overall adjust the writing style so that it appears less obvious that AI was used. I also normally do not use AI when it comes to confidential information as I am not yet sure how secure it is.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're being thoughtful about both the personal authenticity and the security aspects. The editing process you describe sounds quite involved.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I often use AI to solve difficult contest-level math problems. I begin with the prompt stating the problem and then, using the given answer, I prompt the model again to reverse engineer its solution and steps to that answer. If I spot any mistakes in its reasoning, I correct it and then prompt the model to redo that section of the solution. After doing this repeatedly, I am able to get the model to confidently provide a solution which I can then check using computational enumeration using AI.

AI: That's a fascinating collaborative process you've developed - it sounds like you're really working together with AI to refine and verify solutions step by step. The way you use the known answer to reverse-engineer the solution is particularly clever.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My boss encourages us to use AI for routine emails and other written components. But, among my coworkers, I use AI the most so I am the one doing the influencing rather than being influenced myself.

AI: So you're actually the AI pioneer in your workplace - that's an interesting position to be in. It sounds like you have supportive leadership but you're leading the charge among your peers.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time using AI to create the report card comments was frustrating because it was hard to get the model to make mass edits to certain things without it affecting other things. For example, I wanted to replace all gender-neutral terms in a document to female terms, but the model invented terms like "sher" and "shey" instead of using "her" and "she". But once I switched models and come up with a rewording of the prompt, I was able to make the correct edits to the document and thus saving myself a lot of time.

AI: That's a great example of the learning curve involved - it sounds like that initial frustration led to you developing better prompting strategies and finding the right tool for the job. The invented words like "sher" and "shey" must have been quite unexpected!

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI can be a very good teacher rather than just something that does things for you. When I use AI to create new math problems for tests, I also ask it to explain how it knew which numbers to use. I can then get inspiration to create my own problems. For writing, AI generated texts have grammatical quirks which I can then use to sound more professional in my own writing. This is why I always carefully review what AI creates for me; so that I can fix it if needed, or to learn from it.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - you're treating AI as a learning partner rather than just a tool. The way you extract insights from both its problem-creation process and its writing patterns shows you're actively using it to develop your own skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I want to use it for more complex tasks. I have recently begun paying for some models which have better capabilities. I am hoping to be able to create LaTeX documents using AI.

AI: That's an exciting next step - LaTeX can definitely be complex, so having AI help with that could be quite powerful for your work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a learning tool rather than just for delegation - the way you analyze its methods to improve your own skills is quite sophisticated.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we covered everything.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the learning opportunities you've identified, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining authenticity while leveraging AI's capabilities will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
