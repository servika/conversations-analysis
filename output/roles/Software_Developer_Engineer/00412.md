Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for coding assistance, document summarization, and text extraction and analysis

AI: That's helpful - you're using AI across quite a range of tasks. 

When you say coding assistance, what does that look like for you day-to-day? Are you asking for help debugging, writing new functions, or something else entirely?

User: Most of the time it's regarding debugging and suggestions for how to finish the code

AI: That gives me a good picture of your coding workflow. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When the task requires 100% accuracy and a very particular tone that needs context to understand, I rather just do it myself. Even if the task is repetitive and is ideally automated, my experience with AI chatbots makes me feel that it would still take less time to do it myself than to use AI. Giving a lot of context and complex instructions takes quite a long time and a less than 100% result is not good enough

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's a calculation you're doing between the setup time versus the reliability of results. 

Can you give me a specific example of one of those repetitive tasks where you've decided it's faster to do it yourself rather than work with AI?

User: Searching through vast sets of documents and extracting text to determine legal applicability and design implications to a particular project. This would require AI to understand the context (possible security issues) and the legal nuances of particular laws and regulations. The security issues notwithstanding, I just don't think AI chatbots are capable of handling such a task yet, though I haven't really tried to give it a full stab at it. I'm not looking to get a half-right answer and then build on it, I want the correct answer every time.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the stakes are really high when you're dealing with legal compliance and security considerations.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Definitely delegate complete tasks to handle independently for now. I could definitely see myself collaborating with it but my schedule doesn't lend itself to that type of interaction right now. My primary use case at the moment is to automate tasks.

AI: That's interesting - so you're looking for that hands-off automation approach right now.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We work with machine learning models and are looking to implement them in company processes but also with clients. It's made me more comfortable with AI, I had hardly used it before my current workplace

AI: So your workplace has really been the catalyst for your AI adoption - that's fascinating.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was trying to deploy a database and was asking AI for commands and coding solutions to issues I was having when setting up the database. Since I was using a particular company's database, though it was open-source, it was difficult for AI to find the solutions. This was expected but what was frustrating was that instead of admitting it couldn't find anything, the AI would produce an answer that looked correct at first glance and give a reference. The answer was always incorrect and the reference link was broken every time, the AI made up a reference to make the answer seem more legitimate.

AI: That's a really specific and telling frustration - the hallucinated references that looked legitimate but were completely fabricated. That must have been particularly problematic when you were trying to solve a technical issue under time pressure.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about it but instead of fighting against it, I embrace it. I'm actively trying to develop tools that would allow AI to take over entire tasks/areas of work that are common to my industry. I see it as a tool that can open up more time for humans to focus on more complex analytical and creative problems.

AI: That's a really forward-thinking perspective - using AI as a lever to elevate the type of work you do rather than seeing it as competition.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think every person should be proficient in interacting with AI in the same way we use personal computers. It is a beneficial tool that can increase productivity and allow us to spend time on more complex issues.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on embracing AI as a way to focus on more complex analytical and creative problems rather than seeing it as something to resist.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's it, thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between AI reliability and setup time, the importance of accuracy in high-stakes tasks, and your forward-thinking approach to skill development will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
