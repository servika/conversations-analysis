Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI occasionally during my workday when I need help with crafting messages to social media users or for content creation posts.

AI: That's interesting - social media and content creation work. Tell me more about that. When you say you use AI "occasionally," what determines when you decide to bring AI into the process versus handling those messages and posts entirely on your own?

User: If I'm struggling with figuring out how I want to word things, like I know what I want to say but can't think of the accurate phrasing, I use AI to help me craft messages and posts. I also use it when I need to be creative and don't have that idea already at hand. Sometimes, I find that the days I'm feeling less inspired or more mentally jumbled, I'm more likely to use AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a thinking partner when you're stuck or when inspiration isn't flowing naturally. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on these tasks. Are there certain aspects of social media messaging or content creation that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those aspects different for you?

User: I guess general aspects where I may need to message with a user and bring in feeling, I usually handle that myself. But if I'm struggling with how to handle a situation, or need a creative idea and can't find the inspiration I get the help of AI. Sometimes I just use AI to bounce ideas off of. Like, I don't use the output from the AI exactly, but will take it and use it to spark up something in my own words.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - keeping the emotional, feeling-based interactions as your domain while using AI more as a creative springboard. 

When you do work with AI on these tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you mentioned bouncing ideas off it - are you more likely to collaborate with AI throughout a task, going back and forth, or do you tend to give it a request and then take its output to work with independently?

User: I tend to use AI in the manner of taking the output and working independently, making some tweaks on my own. There are occasions when I do find that I will go back and forth with AI, like if I need to add some details or requests due to it not quite being what I had in mind

AI: That's helpful - so primarily a "get output and refine it yourself" approach, with some back-and-forth when needed for adjustments.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the environment you're in shaped how you approach using these tools?

User: Honestly, I'm not sure what my colleagues do as far as AI- we are remote and kind of a hands-off more independent type work. As far as culture goes, we are free to use the tools, so long as we do not let it be all we rely on.

AI: Interesting - so you have that freedom to use AI tools with the understanding that they shouldn't become a complete crutch. That seems to align with how you're actually using them.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was a time when I was unsure of how to respond to a message with a user. I knew exactly the idea of what I wanted to say, but the phrasing had slipped my mind. I briefly described the situation to AI, and got not only advice on the situation, but help with the phrase I was thinking of.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying moment - when AI helped you unlock exactly what was already in your mind but just out of reach. It's interesting that you got both the situational advice and the specific phrasing you were looking for.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel like social media management-as far as overseeing community groups, pages, etc. are pretty safe right now due to a lot of companies and organizations, specifically mine, wanting that human interaction and oversight. I do find myself strengthening in other areas and skillsets though in case I do want to further my career in other areas.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - recognizing that human interaction and oversight remain valuable while still building other skills for future opportunities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from how you use it now?

User: Not really, I think it will stay pretty much the same for now. I do see potential in AI tools being brought in social media platforms and using it for group/content management as far as AI detecting specifics in posts, engagement, etc. I could see more interaction with AI that way.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - seeing AI potentially becoming more integrated into the platforms themselves for detection and management tasks, which could change how you interact with it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a thinking partner when you're mentally jumbled or need inspiration, while keeping those human, feeling-based interactions as your own domain.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That is all :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative springboard while maintaining that human touch in emotional interactions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through how you've found that balance between AI assistance and your own expertise. Have a great rest of your day!
