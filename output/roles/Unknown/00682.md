Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions. I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for routine tasks like some light scheduling. I have tried using it to summarize sets of emails or work documents. Occaisonally, I use it to gather information on topics important for my work. However, I usually have to follow up in that case.

AI: Tell me more about that follow-up you mentioned when gathering information. What usually happens that requires you to dig deeper?

User: The facts provided are usually accurate but often incomplete. Also, AI models have unfortunately been inaccurate about references to academic articles when asked. So, while a source for the information provided exists, I sometimes have to track it down myself.

AI: That's really helpful context. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The tasks I prefer to handle myself fall into three categories: (1) Higher stakes tasks such as communications with my colleagues and students or scheduling of important events or projects. (2) Direct calculation tasks in mathematics and physics, but only advanced ones. (3) Exploratory tasks relating to new ideas, especially early on.

AI: What is it about those exploratory tasks with new ideas that makes you want to handle them yourself, especially early on?

User: I've found that when beginning to investigate a new topic, AI models will generally focus on very standard approaches, texts, mental models. This is appropriate for someone trying to learn a new field as a student but for a professional exploring branching interests, it delays finding connections or new ideas. Therefore, I start out by looking for myself at original sources and then use AI to "fill in the blanks" where needed for the basic background.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task. I am not an expert in crafting prompts so I will often have to refine what it is that I am looking for from the AI. Things like "do not schedule these meetings before class" have to be added. If I was better at it, I might be able to delegate some routine tasks. This is one of my goals.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not significantly, we are fairly independent. More broadly, there is concern about students cheating using AI and thereby harming themselves by depriving themselves of the learning they are supposed to be doing but it has not been a significant problem in my own courses (so far) due to the ways in which I structure assessments and to some extent the subject matter.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was able to schedule a week's worth of meetings in about ten minutes by using AI. I found that very beneficial and a great relief.

AI: That sounds like a great experience! How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have known some who despair and look at their skills as being made less valuable due to AI, but I prefer to instead see it as an opportunity to enhance those skills I already have and treat it as a sort of challenge. If an AI can do something, then I believe should see that as a starting point and try to be able to do more. I do however acknowledge that AI models will probably always be faster than I can be and sometimes "good enough" is sufficient in work contexts so getting better can seem to lack a benefit. The existence and popularity of AI is therefore a motivation to broaden my skills.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to transfer more routine tasks to AI and to be able to collaborate more closely to complete work goals more quickly and therefore reach more of my work goals.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a starting point to push yourself to do more, rather than seeing it as competition.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that is all. Thanks.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between collaboration and delegation, the importance of maintaining control over high-stakes tasks, and your approach to skill development in an AI world will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
