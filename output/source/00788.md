Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically, I  personally use AI to  research topics related to my ethical fashion business (sustainability, ethics in the garment industry, Principles of Fair Trade, etc). I then use this information to craft posts for social media, or to help write an email to customers.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI plays a key role in both your research and communication efforts for your ethical fashion business.

When you say you use AI to research these topics, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you go about gathering that information?

User: I'll say something like: give me 10 quick facts about sustainability issues in the garment industry. to an AI model, like Chat GPT. Then I'll look at the results, and will choose one to focus a social media post around (for example, Did you know there were X amount of clothes that are dumped into landfill everyday.) I'll ask the model to help me craft a short and engaging post to put on social media with that information.

AI: That's a clear workflow - research first, then content creation. 

Tell me more about that moment when you're looking at those 10 facts and choosing which one to focus on. What goes through your mind as you're making that selection? What makes one fact more appealing than another for your social media post?

User: I think about issues that are important to me, and that might be interesting to my customer base. What is something that I personally would like to know more about in the industry? Sometimes I am looking for a theme to center around, like posts that work for Earth Day.

AI: That makes sense - you're filtering through both your personal interests and what would resonate with your audience.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to write my own letters and emails to make sure that it comes from my heart. If I use AI for anything on the task, it would be for simple grammatical corrections and suggestions. It's really important for the message to sound like me rather than canned.

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making - keeping that authentic voice in your personal communications.

When you do use AI for those social media posts we talked about earlier, how do you make sure those still sound like you? Do you find yourself editing or adjusting what the AI gives you?

User: I do end up editing everything to sound more like me. Sometimes it's like: oh, I wouldn't use that word in my diction, so I'm going to say this one instead. Other times, it's changing or removing the excessive amount of emojis Chat likes to add, lol

AI: Ha! That's a great detail about the emoji overload - it sounds like you've really figured out AI's particular quirks.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete request and then work with what it gives you?

User: I do a little bit of both. Sometimes I'll describe the entire scenario: write a short prompt featuring ethically made coffee. Make sure the tone is warm. Focus on how ours is elite, but don't knock other brands, etc. Other times, I'll give a quick prompt: give me a short caption that features this necklace made with moonstone. Then I'll go back and forth adjusting it with the model: make the girl have brown eyes. She is holding a coffee cup, etc.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like you adapt your approach based on how clear your vision is upfront.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned having an ethical fashion business, I'm curious about whether you work with others and how they view AI use.

User: Yes, that's exactly right. Sometimes I don't have everythign I want to say up front, and it evolves. Other times, I find myself only using the AI for editing checks. 

I am an independent contractor, but I do have other ambassador acquaintances who do the same thing I do. The founder of our company has suggested that we use AI to help us brainstorm if we are stuck with wording, or develop emails, or "make a caption sound good." There isn't one certain way we are instructed or required to work with AI, but it has been a good suggestion for getting out of a rut.

AI: That's interesting that your founder is actively encouraging AI use as a creative tool when you're stuck. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I find that I have to fact check or ask for sources. Sometimes the facts aren't straight, and I don't want to get caught in an unintentional lie or for fabricating anythign for my customers or colleagues.

AI: That's a really important point about accuracy - especially when you're building trust with customers around ethical practices.

Can you tell me more about a specific time when you caught AI giving you incorrect information? What happened, and how did you handle it?

User: I remember a specific occasion where I was looking up how to clean certain items of clothing to extend the life of it. I was curious about different types of mold and what a yellow mold might be on an old leather bag. The AI model hallucinated a made up name for the yellow mold- I can't remember the exact name, but I want to say it said it was "Mustard Gas Mold."

AI: Oh wow, "Mustard Gas Mold" - that's quite a fabrication! That must have been a red flag moment where you realized something was off.

How did that experience change the way you approach using AI for research? Do you now have specific strategies for checking the information you get?

User: I'll usually do a quick google check to see the accuracy of the statement and also help me find a direct source to quote for the information. I don't look at the AI feature google has now because it doesn't list sources. I search for a specific article source that appears accredited, check out the page, and then use a direct quote, orjust note it as a source of information for ppl to learn more.

AI: That's a smart verification system you've developed. It sounds like you've found a good balance between leveraging AI's speed for brainstorming and maintaining accuracy through traditional sourcing.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I am a constant reader and learner, so I don't think I personally would lose skills for using AI in the ways I have described to you. There are some ways I think it would be helpful for AI to takeover- like maintaining an emailing schedule from thanking a customer for a purchase, checking in on that order, making sure they are satisfied, then encouraging them to shop again over a 3 month period. Automating a set schedule for this would help so I don't have to try to remember when something was purchased and what it was.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - you're identifying areas where automation would actually free you up to focus on more strategic work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops or as your business grows?

User: I can see me leaning on it more for email content ideas. If automation becomes something that is offered in the future, it's definitely something I would get on board with. My work is in sales, essentially, so I don't foresee AI being able to replace the human connection involved. I do see it being a helpful tool when used with thoughtful intention.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - "a helpful tool when used with thoughtful intention." You've shared some really thoughtful perspectives about your experience with AI in your ethical fashion work, especially around that balance between efficiency and authenticity.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's all for now :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. I found your insights about maintaining authenticity while leveraging AI's efficiency really valuable, especially that example about the "Mustard Gas Mold" hallucination and how it shaped your fact-checking approach.

Your perspective on using AI as a creative brainstorming tool while keeping the human connection at the center of your sales work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Thanks again for participating in this interview!
