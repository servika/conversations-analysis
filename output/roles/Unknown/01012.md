Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, no questions!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work for my city in sort of a DPW department that does different maintenance tasks around the city. I help in parks and schools mainly. I use AI to help with problem solving or trying to figure out how much of something we would potentially need given a certain scenario.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI for planning and problem-solving in municipal work. 

Can you walk me through a specific example of when you used AI to figure out how much of something you'd need? What was the scenario and how did that process work for you?

User: Sure. Every year we set up Christmas lights around certain parts of the city but mostly in our biggest public park. We decorate a part of the park in a sort of "Santa's House" style where families go and visit Santa during Winter. Last year we used AI to help plan out just how many lights we'd need to hang about the park. How big is "Santa's House" dimensionally, how long are certain string of lights, how many bulbs are there, etc that we'd need to perfectly fit the house or trees. Instead of buying a large amount of lights and just guessing we used AI to help keep costs down.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application - helping you be more precise with your resource planning rather than just estimating. 

Tell me more about how you actually worked with the AI on that project. Did you feed it all the measurements and specifications at once, or was it more of a back-and-forth conversation where you refined the plan together?

User: We actually tried both of those approaches but felt like the back-and-forth was easier in trying to get the AI to understand the overall project. Just feeding it all of the data at once seemed to overwhelm it. Plus going back and forth was great in trying to get different results with bulb types since there are different kinds.

AI: That's a great insight about the collaborative approach working better. It sounds like you discovered that breaking it down and having that dialogue helped the AI understand the nuances of your project better.

When you were going back and forth about different bulb types, what kinds of variations were you exploring? Was it about brightness, color, durability, or something else that mattered for your outdoor winter setup?

User: All of those were important in trying to figure out the best types. Mainly we focused on bulb type with size so we could get the full run dimensions of a string of lights compared to how long we needed to hang. Durability was of course important since they would be hung up in early December and last until New Years dayish.

AI: That makes perfect sense - needing to balance the practical requirements like string length and weather durability with the visual effect you wanted.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I would say scheduling, ordering or sending emails are things that I would rather do myself. I never know if I might remember something that I need to order in that moment and if I might know someone at the job or personally know that could help get these things cheaper than a simple search online.

AI: That's really thoughtful - it sounds like those tasks rely heavily on your institutional knowledge and personal relationships that AI wouldn't have access to. The example about knowing someone who could get you a better deal is particularly interesting.

When you do use AI for work tasks like the Christmas lights planning, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the entire process, or do you tend to give it a specific piece to handle on its own?

User: I tend to collaborate with it throughout. I'd rather not just let it handle the entire thing without input from myself or someone else at work.

AI: That collaborative approach seems to work well for you. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it too, or are you kind of pioneering this on your own?

User: I would say I might have started using it first as I'm a bit younger than others in the department. There are others who use it but more for personal use.

AI: So you're kind of leading the way in bringing AI into the actual work processes. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The Christmas lights scenario I was really satisfied with in the end as it really helped and everyone involved was happy with the results. As for frustrated I might say when these types of AI first started coming up and weren't as advanced as they are not was annoying with it not understanding what I actually wanted from it. I believe I was asking it something simple about how high do you hang owlboxes for specific types of owls in my region.

AI: That's a great contrast - the satisfaction of getting exactly the help you needed with the Christmas lights versus the frustration of early AI not grasping what should have been a straightforward question about owl box placement.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not sure AI could potentially take over the manual work we do but I could see it doing the ordering, emails, etc. I don't really consider this just yet in my field of work since I'm only doing office tasks a few hours a week.

AI: That's a practical perspective - recognizing that the physical, hands-on nature of most of your work isn't something AI can replace, while being aware of where it might have more impact.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as the tools improve?

User: I could see once it gets better using it with emails or communications between people. I don't think I'd ever trust it with ordering things or scheduling. I could see it being used for exactly what I've used it for the past year, problem solving where a person could save a great  deal of time on these sorts of situations. They will have to check and make sure the overall responses are correct but someone taking a half hour to do that beats someone taking a few hours.

AI: That's a really insightful wrap-up - you see AI's sweet spot as that problem-solving assistant role where it can save significant time, but with human oversight to verify the results.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the collaborative, back-and-forth approach worked better than just dumping all the data at once, and your clear thinking about which tasks benefit from your personal relationships and local knowledge.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope that's everything!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI for planning and problem-solving in municipal work, especially that Christmas lights project, and your thoughtful approach to collaboration versus delegation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me today!
