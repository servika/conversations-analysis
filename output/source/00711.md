Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: yes and no questions

AI: Perfect, let's get started then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: We recently had Gemini capabilities added to our Google suite and are encouraged to use it. I have used it to locate files in our extensive drive, to compare similar files, and to try and see when certain edits were made to a file

AI: That's really helpful to understand. It sounds like you're using it primarily for file management and organization tasks within your Google environment.

When you say you've used it to compare similar files, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: I had two version of a resume and wanted to extract descriptive text that made sure all aspects were captured from both, but that nothing was repeated

AI: That's a really interesting use case - essentially using AI to help you consolidate and deduplicate content across versions.

Tell me more about that experience. How did the AI handle that task compared to how you might have approached it yourself?

User: it was of course much faster when the AI did it. The writing style was quite different than what I had intended for this purpose - it was a little too far geared towards a general audience but I was able to shift it over several prompts to get it to be where I wanted, and then I edited it myself. I asked it to include more examples from certain parts of the resumes but it didn't do exactly what I wanted so I manually added those in later

AI: So it sounds like there was this back-and-forth process where you were guiding it toward what you needed. You mentioned the writing style wasn't quite right initially and you had to shift it over several prompts.

What was it about that iterative process that worked or didn't work for you? How did you know when to keep prompting versus when to just take over and edit manually?

User: The iterative process was not shifting the tone/style of the writing as far as I wanted each time, so I believe after 3 tries I took over.

AI: That makes sense - you hit a point where it wasn't getting you closer to what you needed, so you switched to doing it yourself.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I prefer to write emails myself because I think that others I work with are tuned into when something "sounds" or "reads" like it was at least partially AI generated. I have also tried to have Gemini search for certain file types with similar titles, but there was definitely hallucination in the list of titles produced, so I didn't trust the output and just did the searching and compiling myself

AI: That's really insightful - you're making decisions based on both how others might perceive AI-generated content and also on reliability concerns when you've experienced hallucination.

When you mention that your colleagues are "tuned into" AI-generated content, tell me more about that. What have you observed about how people in your workplace react to or discuss AI-generated communication?

User: Some people think that others who write emails with the help of AI are less genuine or generally care less about that aspect of the job. I myself am biased and think for simple emails, it is a little lazy

AI: That's a really honest perspective. It sounds like there are some unspoken workplace norms developing around AI use, especially for communication.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture more broadly influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have there been any explicit discussions or policies, or is it more of an informal understanding?

User: There has been explicit encouragement  to use AI, and a variety of webinars/trainings offered and highly encouraged for employees to attend to learn more about effective uses of it. I am still open to exploring ways in which it could be useful to me personally

AI: That's interesting - there's this official encouragement and training, but you're also navigating those informal perceptions about things like email writing.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had tried to use Gemini to locate all instances of Google Slides files that matched a certain name, but it hallucinated some names. That was frustrating because I felt like I had wasted time and could not trust the output of the model.

AI: That frustration really comes through - especially when you're trying to use AI to save time but then have to double-check everything anyway.

When that happened with the hallucinated file names, how did it change your approach to using AI for similar tasks going forward? Do you find yourself being more cautious about certain types of requests now?

User: I have not tried to  use Gemini to perform an identical or nearly identical task, but I suppose that I would be open to trying again since I know that the models are constantly being refined. I do indeed place additional scrutiny on the outputs of the models when I do use them.

AI: That's a thoughtful balance - staying open to trying again while being more careful to verify the outputs.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No, because I am an expert in a highly specialized field of biology that AI could not perform the vast majority of tasks with. However I have used AI to up my coding/script writing.

AI: That's a fascinating contrast - being in a highly specialized biology field where you feel confident about your expertise, but then actively using AI to build skills in coding.

Tell me more about how you've used AI for coding and script writing. How has that experience been different from your other AI interactions at work?

User: With getting chunks of code, I can run them in my console right away and see if they work or not - and requesting information on error outputs has been useful in understanding why code I wrote, or even in a number of  cases the AI provided, was wrong, and how to improve or utilize workarounds. that has vastly helped me to create more complex code faster.

AI: That immediate feedback loop really makes a difference - you can test the code right away and then use AI to help troubleshoot when things don't work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself expanding into other areas, or are you pretty settled into the patterns you've found work for you?

User: As more guidance from our workplace comes out I will be sure to pay attention to any mandates vs suggestions for use

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on navigating the tension between official workplace encouragement and those informal concerns about genuineness, especially around email communication.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of AI adoption - from the immediate feedback benefits in coding to the trust issues with file searching, and those nuanced workplace dynamics around AI-generated communication - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your honesty throughout this conversation. Have a great rest of your day!
