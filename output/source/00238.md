Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I sometimes use AI to write lesson plans, but usually have to do a lot of tweaking. I've also used AI to create templates for letters of recommendation, or to ask for synonyms of certain words if I am preparing a document.

AI: That's helpful context - it sounds like you're working in education. 

Tell me more about the tweaking you mentioned with lesson plans. What kinds of changes do you typically need to make to get them where you want them?

User: Some of the content in the lesson plans is too easy or too difficult for my real-life students, or, we've already done something that was part of the AI generated lesson plan.  I don't want my lessons to be redundant.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you know your students and what they've already covered in ways the AI couldn't.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I guess I'm not sure how AI could help me right now besides writing lesson plans.  I am a music teacher, so a lot of what I do is tangible, hands-on activities-playing instruments, having student write down things they hear in music, dances, and the like.

AI: That's a great point about the hands-on nature of music teaching. It sounds like the physical and interactive aspects are really central to what you do.

When you do use AI for tasks like those lesson plans or recommendation letter templates, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to ask for something complete and then work on it yourself?

User: I tend to ask for something complete and then make any necessary changes on my own.

AI: That's interesting - so you're more in a delegation mode rather than a collaborative back-and-forth.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that others in your school are using it similarly, or differently?

User: I don't know that any of my colleagues are using AI very often.  Since they have not done a deep dive, I have not felt any pressure to do so, either.  Most of the time, I hear about people using it to edit work that has already been written, like cleaning up an email to sound more professional.

AI: So it sounds like AI use is still pretty light across your workplace, and mostly for polishing existing work when it does come up.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I know there are AI capabilities in some of the song-making apps that are available for students.  This would be particularly satisfying, knowing that students that need the extra examples or support will have it.  I do my best to support all students, but in classes of 20+ kids, it's hard to give everyone individualized attention.

AI: That's a really thoughtful example - using AI as a way to extend your reach and provide that individualized support you want to give but can't always manage with large classes.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Like I said, I haven't found how AI fits into my work life right now, but I'm open to the idea of letting it take over tasks that would leave me more time to work on other things.

AI: That's a practical approach - staying open to possibilities while focusing on what works for you now.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself exploring new ways to use it, or do you think you'll stick with the current approach?

User: I want to explore AI capabilities beyond just chat bots. I also think I can use it as an organization tool when it comes to documents.

AI: That's intriguing - you're thinking beyond text generation to more organizational and workflow support.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI could help extend individualized support to students in large classes - that really highlights the human-centered way you're thinking about these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not at this time.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI in education - especially the balance between the hands-on, interactive nature of music teaching and the potential for AI to support lesson planning and student individualization - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
