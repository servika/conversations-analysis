Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: One recent project that I have worked on was for a carbon capture and utilization study. We were interested in seeing the technical, economical, and life cycle analysis impact of capturing a a carbon based feedstock and feeding it to microbes that could produce products from it. It started with analyzing the gas composition that would be fed to the microbes. The composition would be used with a reactor model to determine the metabolic pathways of products that would be made for commercial purposes. Generally speaking, the flow rate and composition of the gas can also determine how large all the equipment would need to be, so we can gather economic data from that. Finally, we can make estimates on utility consumptions from the process as well as the carbon sequestered in our process, so we can report out why greenhouse gas savings, typically in the Scope 1 and Scope 2 range.

AI: That's a fascinating project - the integration of technical modeling, economic analysis, and life cycle assessment sounds quite complex. It sounds like there were several distinct phases there, from the initial gas composition analysis through to the final greenhouse gas impact calculations.

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I mostly like to experiment with AI models to see if they can help bridge the gap in estimation between what is recorded in databases/literature vs. what could help with estimation. Greenhouse gas emission databases are pretty extensive, but sometimes the GHG potentials (in units of CO2eq) for some components are either not tabulated or potentially behind a paywall. It is helpful to have estimations of these for internal and sometimes external reporting to get a better picture of how intensive a process is at carbon savings.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI to fill in those data gaps when you can't find GHG potentials in the standard databases or when they're not accessible. 

Tell me more about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for estimating these GHG potentials. What goes through your mind when you're facing one of those missing data points?

User: I am typically trying to work with the AI for it to help me settle in on a reasonable approach for estimating. In the past, as an example, I have received helpful methods of estimating based on the functional group(s) of the unknown molecule and comparing it with functional groups of molecules with known CO2eq scores. There's more that can go into it than just functional groups, like we will work together to spot check other items such as elemental balance, structure, or other items, but finding similar components based on those which I have learned from the AI has been a helpful approach.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI to help you develop estimation methodologies based on molecular similarities rather than just getting a direct number. It sounds like you're building a systematic way to make those estimates.

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the reactor modeling, equipment sizing, or the metabolic pathway analysis - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: It's not so much that something has not been keeping me back from using AI tools in those areas, it's more so that those areas are more within my domain of expertise/familiarity. I will use AI tools give me quick recaps or summaries of terms or methods when I am either unfamiliar or rusty on the topic, but I have not had the need to use them for frameworks for deep AI analysis.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're more confident in your own expertise for those core areas. So it sounds like AI serves different roles for you: filling knowledge gaps in areas outside your main expertise, versus providing quick refreshers on familiar topics.

When you've used AI for estimating those GHG potentials based on functional groups, how do you verify or validate what it produces?

User: There's no firm validation process that goes into place. I do however rationalize whether the results are reasonable and confirm it with my team as well. So, when we report the CO2 eq scores, we will clearly label the assumptions we have made on the components that have missing data. I think we are able to get away with it largely because these components make up a small portion of the overall mass balance, so even if the estimations are horribly off, the overall CO2eq scores should still be within reason.

AI: That's a really practical approach - acknowledging the uncertainty transparently and putting it in context of the overall impact. It sounds like you've found a way to leverage AI's help while being appropriately cautious about the limitations.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Looking ahead, if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: One thing that would potentially be helpful, and I admittedly am not sure if this is a limitation, but I think it would be helpful for AI tools to use literature based results for estimation as opposed to numerical estimations. There are some times when I am trying to estimate Henry's constants for chemicals with water (such as nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide) at non-ideal pressures. Often times I find the AI models first approach is to find numerical methods for calculating this, but it would be much simpler if it first decided to scan literature sources to see if there are tabulated literature records for these values.

AI: That's a really insightful observation - you'd prefer AI to prioritize empirical data from literature over computational approaches for these physical property estimations. It sounds like there's a disconnect between how AI tends to approach these problems versus what would actually be most useful for your work.

Those are all my questions - your perspective on using AI to bridge data gaps while maintaining appropriate skepticism, and your insight about preferring literature-based over computational approaches, were particularly helpful. 

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: Not quite. I think that just about covers everything. Thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for knowledge gaps while relying on your own expertise in your core areas, and especially your point about wanting AI to prioritize empirical literature data over computational methods, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
