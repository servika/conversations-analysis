Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I don't have any questions before we begin.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mostly use AI to research information on health topics that come up with my clients to gain further knowledge so that I can stay as informed as possible and be able to answer their questions about their unique situations. Sometimes  I will ask AI while I am actively working with a client to assure them that we are doing the most appropriate treatments in the best way possible for them. This helps them to feel more confident in our daily interactions. It also allows them to ask deeper questions and feel included in their care instead of feeling that they 'just have to accept what is being done and deal with it."

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you provide more informed and collaborative care. 

Tell me more about how using AI during client sessions actually works. What does that interaction look like when you're actively working with a client?

User: Well, because of client/provider confidentiality, I can only give a general example. Let's say they ask 'why do we have to do the stretches before we go for a walk or get in the pool?' I can give them the 'typical' speech the doctor has already given, that warming the muscles when you sit or lay down most of the time keeps them from becoming cramped or spasming and 'the doctor said so.' But when I suggest that we see what AI has to say, we can be creative in how we ask, and they feel more involved and we can tweak the way we ask and sometimes ask for silly descriptions to explain, or ask to have it broken down in layman's terms or make it very clinical. So I feel like my clients appreciate and are more compliant when we include AI asks into their care. Of course, in the end, they must do their required stretching before exercising/therapies, but they are more relaxed and usually I get praised for caring for them so well. This makes all feel good.

AI: That's fascinating - you're essentially using AI as a collaborative tool to help clients become more engaged participants in their own care. It sounds like the ability to ask questions in different ways and get varied explanations really makes a difference.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I always explain first from my medical point of view, and what is requested by the provider. Then I ask if it makes sense, and they understand. Most of the time, we go with that, but there are times, especially when therapies are long and painful, that they get anxious and frustrated and want to know why they must keep doing 'these stupid stretches' that hurt or seem repetitive, and then I use AI to have some fun and give a different perspective. Some clients are belligerent, some just dread the interruption, while others are very compliant. Therefore, it is very individualized and random when and if I use AI. I always start with the simplest, which is directly from the doctor's recommendations, and then go with what feels right in the moment, but always, in the end, for the most part, I get compliance. I use AI as a fun tool sometimes, too. Such as a reward, to make silly requests after they finish the session. It gives something to look forward to, especially when I work with a child. They love to come up with really silly questions to see how AI will respond, but only after they've finished their sessions. I want each client to feel they have some say in their outcomes, even when they really don't.

AI: That's really thoughtful - you're using your clinical judgment to decide when AI might help, and you're adapting to each individual client's needs and personality. The way you use it as both an educational tool and sometimes as a reward system is quite creative.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Something like: "Hello, [REDACTED]. Today is beautiful outside, so we are going to start with your legs and get some good stretches in so that we can walk to the garden." He replies, "No, I don't like the stretches, I just want to go see my flowers. I'm tired of the pain. The stretches are dumb and I'm not doing them anymore!" Me: " Well, if we can do just a few of the easy ones, then we could ask AI what they think is the most important stretch to do so that you can walk to the garden. What do you think? We could come up with a silly request and see how funny AI will be." He replies, "Oh, could we ask if walking on my hands would be easier?" (then laughs) ME:

AI: That's a great example of how you use AI collaboratively in the moment to redirect and engage your clients! I can see how that approach helps turn resistance into participation.

So it sounds like you're definitely more in the collaborative mode with AI - working with it as part of the conversation rather than asking it to handle complete tasks on its own. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My boss prefers that we use it at each session with our clients, more so to record interactions, and not as a reward, as I do. I have found that using it the way I do, I get almost 95% compliance, and it has been instrumental in getting clients back to their lives with a higher quality of life and better mobility than they started out with, in many instances. My boss has praised me for this, but still doesn't encourage it for other employees so much. When we have team meetings, he usually discourages AI for client interaction, just for helping record sessions, skills, and activities.

AI: That's really interesting - there seems to be a tension between how your boss officially views AI use and what you've discovered works well in practice. It sounds like you've found your own effective approach despite the workplace culture not fully embracing interactive AI use with clients.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When I first started using it, I hated it. It was tedious to use AI to do the record keeping, list out skills, and progress. I felt I shouldn't need to use a computer program when I was trained to do my job using my own skills. But then I started playing with AI on my own and asking general questions about pretend client situations and how AI would handle this. Sometimes I got great answers and sometimes not. So I decided to try asking questions in different ways to help encourage a patient to understand more, in various situations. All this was pretend. I really started liking some of the responses I was getting, so I decided to try it with a few friends who were having health issues. It was fun and entertaining, but also enlightening. So then I asked my boss if I could use AI to enhance only one client situation, a child. He said it would be okay, because I could use AI to make stories with a similar child. So it became more of a storytelling tool. I didn't like it much, nor did the child. So I asked the child what they would like to learn about their condition, and we decided to ask AI silly questions on how to treat it, then really serious questions. The child had so much fun with the outcome that I tried it with a difficult gentleman that I worked with. He was more fun than the child and would beg to just come up with his treatments based on AI. I, of course, had to tell him it would be a reward for compliance, and he could be as silly or serious as he wanted. We also found better ways through AI to accommodate his particular situation, which his doctor was quite pleased with at follow-up visits. I still don't feel AI is perfect or right for every situation, but it is interesting to get a 'second' opinion to enhance client satisfaction and compliance. It is still frustrating at times, but I have learned to use it to my clients advantage, thus making treatments and therapies better.

AI: That's such a compelling journey - from initial resistance to discovering your own creative approach that's actually improving client outcomes. It sounds like the breakthrough came when you shifted from using AI as a documentation tool to using it as an interactive engagement tool.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think AI could be helpful in furthering my learning, but I use caution in saying this, because AI is only as good as the program used. I am still somewhat skeptical as to AI potentially taking over because it is still 'just a program' even though it sometimes seems that AI is sentient. I don't really think about this aspect that often, as I use it mostly for entertainment and simple requests that I could likely find elsewhere on the internet if I really wanted to. It is an enhancer for me and my clients.

AI: That's a very balanced perspective - seeing AI as an enhancer rather than a replacement, while maintaining healthy skepticism about its limitations.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think my relationship with AI at work will continue to be just what it is, entertainment and a fun way to engage clients in seeking advice from a different source than just doctors and those telling them they will do something and it's for their own good, without giving them any say or knowledge that AI can sometimes provide. AI is great when used as a help tool. I would never rely solely on it for any task or situation, especially in the medical field.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've discovered AI can be used as an engagement tool to help clients become more active participants in their own care, even when your workplace culture initially pushed it in a different direction.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding creative ways to use AI to improve client engagement and compliance - even when it differs from your workplace's initial vision - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've developed your own thoughtful approach that balances the benefits of AI with maintaining your professional expertise and judgment. Take care!
