Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I think everything is clear so far. Ask away!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: My role is primarily focused on QA efforts in a development studio. And the primary duty in that role is ensuring high quality AND quantity test coverage for both unit and integration testing. I've found that AI can be a very helpful tool in helping to iterate test data or even test cases once I have a first test or a template for it to work off of. I occasionally use AI to brainstorm ideas, or to analyse code if I'm running into certain types of errors such as syntax problems. It's often faster for the AI to analyse my code than for me to proofread it myself.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your QA workflow. You mentioned using it to iterate test data and test cases once you have that first template. Can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you go from that initial test to having AI help expand it?

User: I usually write a first test, then ensure that the test runs, and provides the output that I'm looking for. After that, I'll makes some notes about how I would want to iterate off of that, or other ideas about how that code might be reusable. Then I will provide the test code to the AI, and request those iterations or other ideas, and see what the results are. Depending on the quality of the results, I may work with the AI to edit them, or do so myself. Following this back and forth, I may also provide the AI more context, such as the function(s) under test, and see if it can find gaps in my coverage, or other brainstorming type conversations to look for more test ideas.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow - thank you for walking me through that. I'm curious about your decision-making process there. You mentioned that depending on the quality of the results, you might work with the AI to edit them or do it yourself. What helps you decide which approach to take in those moments?

User: It's difficult to generalise. It will be a combination of factors - complexity of the code, complexity of the test goals, such as the feature under test or specific output goals, it may just be a matter of test data types, or could be the type of test - some functionalities I work with have so much necessary context that it's easier for me to make those edits then provide the AI with them

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've developed a real intuition for when the context barrier becomes too high for AI to be efficient. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your QA work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I think the initial test coverage step could possibly be handled by AI in some scenarios, but I never use the AI to generate that for me. I also don't brainstorm with the AI nearly as much as I analyse the code myself. Both of these scenarios have the same reasoning behind them: if I automate the process too much, I can risk becoming well connected to my project, which makes me worse at my job. I need to be challenging myself to be a subject matter expert, as well as just a more analytical and insightful engineer on my own. There's also a matter of quality. A lot of the projects I work on are contextually "dense" and so I have found that most of the AI models I have worked with have had difficulty working in complex context scenarios.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your own expertise and connection to the project. You mentioned that staying well-connected to your project is crucial for being effective at your job. Can you tell me more about what "well-connected" means to you in your QA role?

User: It's a combination of understanding the code itself, the core logic of it, but also the intent behind it. By understanding both the "raw" logic being processed, alongside the intended use and a model of what better and worse outcomes are for any given scenario, I am a more valuable team member that helps improve the quality of the end product. And honestly, increases my value as an employee as well.

AI: That really highlights the strategic thinking aspect of your role - understanding both the technical and business layers. You've touched on something I'm curious to explore further. When you do use AI in your workflow - like for iterating test cases or analyzing syntax errors - how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: For iterating test cases, I'd say it's much more common to have a back-and-forth discussion to clarify details. For analysing errors, it's going to be more common to just paste as much context as I think would be necessary and try to resolve it in one go.

AI: That's a clear distinction based on the type of task. It sounds like the more creative, iterative work naturally lends itself to that collaborative approach, while the more diagnostic work can be handled more directly. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or approaches that have shaped how you think about using these tools?

User: I work in a relatively small team, and even at those low numbers, I'm finding a pretty big disparity in attitudes. Some people like to engage with AI more, and iterate off the results, some are more like me where they want to handle initial design and then iterate with the AI when needed, and others just prefer not to engage with it at all. I think it's best if I just make my own decisions, with maybe some input from management if I think it's necessary.

AI: That spectrum of attitudes even within a small team is really interesting. You mentioned making your own decisions about AI use, which sounds like you have that autonomy. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think my most satisfied feelings come from scenarios where I need to create a lot of repetitive test cases, or need a large amount of varied test data, which the AI can create easily. This saves immense amounts of time, and takes a task that I hate off of my plate. As far as being frustrated...that's not very common any more. I think you could say I was frustrated when first attempting to use AI as a resource for coding, and finding a lot of limitations due to quality of returns, but now that I understand the paramters better, I find I don't have frustrated feelings much at all.

AI: It sounds like you've really found your groove with AI - especially for those repetitive tasks that free you up for more valuable work. The learning curve you described is interesting too, where initial frustrations turned into better understanding of how to work within AI's parameters.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you integrate these tools into your workflow?

User: Definitely. I try my best to be self-aware about how much I am relying on AI in my role in general. I think my focus on using it for repetitive tasks strikes or errors I perceive to be small strikes a good balance between saving time, making my life easier, and staying connected with the core duties and skillsets of my role.

AI: That self-awareness sounds like a really deliberate approach to maintaining that balance. As our final question - looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you?

User: My guess that it will be the case that as AI models improve, particularly in the realm of software development, that I will use it for more scenarios at work. It's possible that I would use it more if I had more administrative tasks to perform as well, but it's difficult to foresee. I think my engagement with AI is going to be a very practical one, where I spend some time to determine if it can help me and use it if the return on time investment is positive, and skip it if not. This is ignoring potential decision making "above" me, as I have heard of some studios that have more top-down directives in regards to AI usage. But again, I can't really know anything about that ahead of time.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while staying connected to your core expertise - that strikes me as a very mature approach to integrating these tools.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing in particular comes to mind.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that sweet spot between AI assistance and maintaining your own expertise, especially in a contextually dense field like QA, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating these tools into your workflow. Take care!
