Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready to start!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use AI at my regular job to help me draft communications to coworkers and clients.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does your process look like when you're drafting those communications?

User: I explain to the model what sort of communication I am trying to write -- an email, a task note, a project follow-up, or some marketing copy, for example. I let it know who the audience is and what I am trying to convey and ask it to draft me an example or two of how I could phrase that given item.

AI: That's helpful. When you get those draft examples back, what do you typically do with them? Do you use them as-is, or do you modify them in some way?

User: It depends. I usually end up editing them at least a little bit, because our company-approved AI (which is the only one we can access on the network) has a tendency to sound a little stilted in a way that comes off as clearly AI. But sometimes there is not much editing work needed. For example, I have asked it to help me draft condolence letters to clients who had a loved one pass away, and I will usually have it run two or three different versions and then just combine my favorite lines from them into whatever I think fits the situation best and flows nicely.

AI: When you mention that the company AI sounds "clearly AI" and stilted, what specific things do you notice that give it away? What makes something sound more natural to you?

User: For our model at work, the sentence structures tend to be very repetitive in a way that comes off as unnatural. There are also certain word choices that feel like they are either too niche or chosen imprecisely for the connotations or tone needed, where a human might pick up on it and flag that particular word over another as odd.

AI: That's really insightful about the word choice and connotations. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I will sometimes have AI help me draft marketing copy, but I do not like to let it do actual design even though it could. The designing part is creative and enjoyable, so I like to do that myself. I also work with PII and there are some pieces of information that I can't give the AI for compliance reasons that would be integral to doing some of the more mundane or repetitive tasks I would like to use it for.

AI: That distinction between the creative enjoyable work and the mundane tasks is interesting. When you think about the design work specifically, what is it about that creative process that you want to keep for yourself?

User: There is a satisfaction to seeing a final copy of something out in the world and knowing that you pieced it together yourself. While the AI could probably make something good, I feel like originality and trial and error goes a long way in creative tasks, and it just doesn't feel like using AI for something lets that shine through.

AI: That sense of ownership and seeing your trial-and-error process reflected in the final product really comes through. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I will usually prompt it with something like "draft me a professional-sounding email to a customer updating them on the status of this task and requesting additional information on this thing" and will let it create a draft. Then I will send it a couple refinements until it's like 85% of the way to what I want it to be, and then I will make any final tweaks myself and send it.

AI: So it sounds like you have a back-and-forth process with refinements. What kinds of things typically come up in those refinement rounds? What are you usually asking it to adjust?

User: Usually tone. Like I said, our AI can come off as stilted, but I am in a customer-facing role so I need my emails to sound personable and friendly. Many of these customers have interacted with me over the phone, and I am very bubbly, so they would clock a difference if the email was very cool for example.

AI: That makes perfect sense - maintaining that consistency with your bubbly phone personality. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I have actually not really talked with my colleagues very much about their use of AI. My workplace doesn't encourage it or discourage it -- it is a tool that is available, but I've actually never had anyone say anything about it either way. At my previous agency, my coworkers were more open about using it and I found myself using it more often there than I do at my current agency.

AI: That's interesting that the openness at your previous agency led to more usage. What was different about that environment that made you use it more often there?

User: AI can be pretty controversial but since I was in a small office and about half the staff would openly talk about using it, it felt like there wouldn't be any side-eyeing or judgment for using it in my day-to-day. I also was doing more writing at that agency than I do currently, so there was more to keep up with and therefore more tasks that felt appropriate to ask the AI for help on.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One of my most repetitive tasks was hand-writing welcome cards to new clients. I didn't have a template for it, so I would have to wrack my brain for the content every time and also write it out, or try to remember what I said last time. Eventually I had the AI draft me a sample letter I could just copy to everyone and make a few minor tweaks, and the first one it made was very good and I ended up using that template letter for over a year. 
The AI that runs our internal routing to various corporate departments when we customer-facing representatives need information or assistance from another department is a constant nightmare and I hate it.

AI: That's a great contrast - the welcome card template sounds like a perfect use case that saved you ongoing mental energy. Tell me more about that internal routing AI - what makes it such a nightmare to work with?

User: If you get it over the phone, it is horrible at figuring out what I'm saying and usually needs me to repeat things like policy numbers or aliases two or three times, even if I am using the phonetic alphabet. I could understand this if I had a strong accent, but I do not. It also is not very good at figuring out what the specific thing I am asking about ties in to in order to route me to the right place, either on the phone or in the chat. About 50% of the time I end up being routed to a representative in the wrong department or who is not licensed to help in my state and need to be manually rerouted elsewhere.

AI: That routing system sounds incredibly frustrating, especially when it's slowing you down from helping your clients. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No. While a lot of companies are moving toward AI for customer service, I think a lot of customers ( myself included) get very frustrated having to deal with too much AI screening if they need to talk to a real person, so I think eventually companies will ease off of using them. And even if not, my particular agency prides itself on a "Disney-level customer service experience" and is one of the most staffed agencies in our company. The average staff for our agents is 3.5 -- my agency has 30.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Eventually it might end up being considered safe enough for us to use for the mundane tasks we can't use it for right now due to PII concerns. If the AI were allowed to read our CRM for customer policy data, for example, and answer the simple coverage questions we get, we could spend more time on the complex cases that need a human touch.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the openness of your workplace culture affected your usage patterns, and that distinction you made between wanting to keep the creative, satisfying work while letting AI handle the more repetitive tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining your authentic voice in customer communications, the impact of workplace culture on AI adoption, and the distinction between helpful AI tools versus frustrating ones will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
