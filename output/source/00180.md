Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to draft subject lines for email, get different copy variations for email, other general writing tasks, design briefs, brainstorming, summarising data, help with Q&A's, T&Cs for competition, suggestions for personalisation

AI: That's quite a range of tasks you're using AI for. It sounds like you work in marketing or communications?

Tell me more about how you approach these different tasks with AI - do you find yourself using it differently for something like drafting email subject lines versus, say, brainstorming or creating design briefs?

User: yes sorry I am a marketing specialist. I use it slightly differently I guess. So I would write shorter prompts for drafting subject lines and more detailed ones for brainstorming, and give more structural constraints for design briefs

AI: That makes sense - adapting your approach based on what you need from the AI.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I guess assessing whether copy or creative fits with our brand's tone/voice, and strategic planning - where I will get some suggestions from AI but oversee it and set and change it up myself based on results (but then again I do get help assessing campaign results from AI), and I do check legal requirements for T&Cs etc. but I then send them to our law team for a final check. Sometimes I do prefer brainstorming with my team to AI as well, but then it is good to get a starting point for ideas from AI... so really, there is a place for AI with a lot of things, but it needs human input

AI: It sounds like you see AI as a valuable starting point or collaborator, but you maintain oversight on the strategic and brand-critical elements. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Usually it's collaborative, so I would sent through a prompt and then work through together adjusting it etc. Even if I delegated a task to an AI chatbot I would still need to check it

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds like it's become a natural part of your workflow.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Over the last couple of years my workplace has really embraced it. It is a publishing company and proper journos use it for content ideas/planning, brainstorming, and editing etc. so it isn't frowned upon. It's seen as a helpful tool and not a replacement for humans. It can make our work better and make us more efficient at what we do :)

AI: That positive, tool-focused culture sounds really supportive. It's interesting that even the journalists are embracing it for various aspects of their work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have felt satisfied when getting help with a long brief, as sometimes it can be tedious to write them out, so I was able to provide a template and some general guidance and get a pretty spot-on brief for some creative recently which saved me lots of time, and helped me spark some ideas. Sometimes I've been frustrated with generic-sounding subject lines or copy, which I try to tweak to our brand voice but AI doesn't always get it quite right. Sometimes in those cases it's good for general ideas but needs a human touch and edit by someone close to the brand.

AI: That contrast is really telling - the satisfaction of having AI handle the structural, time-consuming work versus the frustration when it doesn't capture those nuanced brand elements that require your expertise.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think AI can ever fully take over the human creativity and strategy, as there are too many different variables and parts are always changing, plus I don't believe an AI model can fully understand a brand's voice and tone (well... not yet!). I think it also misses some things in regards to data and analytics, even though it can help pick certain things - such as a particular trend or comparing the data to something that is going on with competitors etc - there's no way the AI has all the information that a human does even though it can save time.
I am always maintaining my skills in using the different platforms and keeping abreast of the updates and features - such as with email platforms like Klaviyo - making sure to do any tutorials/webinars, as well as work closely with the customer success manager to figure out best practice. I also keep an eye out on industry trends..and AI ensures that I do have more time now for learning..that I wouldn't have if bogged down trying to analyse data and create copy etc. from scratch like I used to

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - using AI to free up time for the higher-level learning and strategic work that keeps you at the cutting edge. It sounds like you see AI as enabling rather than replacing your professional development.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It is already used with the chatbots and within the platforms we use, so I see it only strengthening and getting smarter, and therefore being even more helpful in the future. Maybe it will be seen almost more like a co-worker/co-creator than a useful tool, if it can really get its head around the brand voice and direction etc..and maybe co-create/collab with the whole business to get all the department's different inputs to become a more strategic partner

AI: That vision of AI evolving from tool to strategic co-creator is fascinating - especially the idea of it potentially integrating inputs across different departments.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI frees up time for the strategic learning that keeps you competitive, and your vision of it potentially becoming more of a collaborative partner as it better understands brand nuances.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI work, the importance of maintaining human oversight on brand-critical elements, and how a supportive workplace culture shapes AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
