Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds great! No questions yet

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I teach art classes online in beginner, intermediate, and advanced types of series. With the beginner's course, I have to accompany the class with an e-book. I use AI to help me write and format the outlines that I turn in to my business partner, so he can approve the class before I record it, and I use AI to help me write and format the e-book.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you with the foundational structure of your courses. 

When you say you use AI to help write and format the outlines and e-books, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like? How do you and the AI work together on those materials?

User: I give the AI an idea of what my class will be about, what format I'm looking for, and the length I need the outline or book chapter outline to be, and I let AI work its magic. We collaborate.

AI: Tell me more about that collaboration part. When you say "we collaborate" - what does that back-and-forth actually look like between you and the AI?

User: After I give AI the information about class content, length of class, length of book, etc., I let AI return an outline or e-book outline to me and go over what's provided. If I need any improvements or changes, I tell AI what I'm looking for and what needs to be adjusted, and the AI returns what it thinks I'm looking for.

AI: That gives me a good sense of your process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in creating your art courses that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Yes, there are tasks I prefer to handle myself. Any photographic detail needed in addition to the worded content, I prefer to insert myself because I use my own photos of my own artwork as examples. I sort through all of my personal photos and decide which photo would be best added to give the content visual examples. It's a more personal task that, although I have the confidence AI could help with accomplishing, I'm not sure would be met with as much accuracy as if I did it myself.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - selecting your own artwork photos seems like it requires that personal artistic judgment. 

When you use AI for the writing and formatting tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work with it step-by-step throughout creating an outline or e-book chapter, or do you tend to give it the initial brief and let it handle complete sections independently?

User: I will usually ask for content step-by-step and make adjustments as we go. I initially give AI an initial brief, but then suggest we move through the process together. Writing and saving as we go.

AI: That step-by-step approach sounds very intentional. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture - maybe your business partner or other online educators you know - influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I don't think my workplace culture has influenced my use of AI in any manner. It's my personal secret.

AI: That's fascinating that you've kept it as your personal approach. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, once I had a deadline fast-approaching for an outline and an e-book that I was in the early stages of completing, and I started having anxiety and panicking a bit. I interacted with AI about all that was taking place and was able to produce both projects overnight with the help of AI. Not only was it completed rapidly, but it was well-written, thorough, and very informative. I was extremely satisfied with my use of AI. On the contrary, I was using AI, trying to get an outline for my advanced class one time, and AI kept providing me information that was inaccurate. That was really frustrating.

AI: Those are two very different experiences! When AI kept providing inaccurate information for your advanced class outline, what kind of inaccuracies were you running into? Was it getting the art techniques wrong, or something else?

User: Yes, it was getting the techniques wrong, and it was giving me repetitive information on a technique I wasn't inquiring about.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I haven't really considered it, only because I don't think AI could provide a pre-recorded class, taught by a person to my business partner for approval. I'm sure it's possible, but it isn't something I've considered a threat in any way.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - you see AI as supporting your work rather than replacing your core teaching role. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you continue developing your courses?

User: Yes, absolutely, AI is supportive in the writing aspect of my job, but I don't think replacing me would be possible anytime soon. I don't necessarily see my relationship evolving with AI, and I don't really know how I could use AI any differently than I already do. It's a rather cut-and-dry process.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on keeping AI as your "personal secret" and how you see it as supportive rather than threatening to your core teaching abilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we have covered all aspects. Thank you.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative writing partner while maintaining control over the creative and visual aspects of your teaching materials will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
