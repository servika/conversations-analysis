Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I teach ESL and I use ai to generate gap fill exercises for my students. I also sometimes ask it to create texts for them to use. For example, I might want them to practice irregular past tense verbs so I'll ask it to write a story using a certain set of verbs. I also sometimes ask it questions about particularly confusing grammar questions or ask it to help me tailor lessons to students with a particular native language. For example I might say, help a French speaker understand how to make an Engish "r" sound.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as both a content creation tool and a specialized teaching consultant. 

Tell me more about that last example you mentioned - when you ask AI to help with language-specific challenges like helping French speakers with English pronunciation. How does that process typically work for you?

User: Usually I'll find that I'm having trouble getting a student to understand something...for example, French speakers have trouble understanding the difference between a short i and long e sound. So I might ask AI to help me. It could give me insights about things like tongue position when making these sounds, if there are any similar sounds in French the student could use as a starting point and minimal pairs (ex. beat/bit) I can use to help them see the difference. Often I just want it to create content I could create easily myself, like a list of minimal pairs, but it will be faster.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're leveraging AI's knowledge about linguistic patterns across languages that would take you much longer to research on your own.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I don't generally ask AI to plan my lessons, even though it could. I'm more interested in having it create content than a structure. This is probably a personal preference though, as I generally don't like to follow schedules imposed from the outside. I could imagine other teachers liking this feature.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - content creation versus structural planning. It sounds like you want to maintain control over the pedagogical flow and decision-making.

When you do use AI for those content creation tasks - like generating gap fill exercises or writing stories with specific verbs - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine what you need, or do you tend to give it complete instructions upfront and let it handle the task independently?

User: I sometimes go back and forth. For example, in a gap fill, I'll ask it to correct errors or change the mix in some way. Sometimes I just take what it gave me and modify it myself without using AI for corrections.

AI: That's helpful - so you're flexible about when to continue the AI collaboration versus when to just take over the editing yourself.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work alone, online, so I don't really have colleagues, but I got into using AI for lessons because a friend with a similar job recommended it for lesson planning.

AI: I see - so while you work independently, that recommendation from a friend in a similar role was your entry point into using AI for teaching.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It's hard to think of specific examples for frustration but I've definitely felt it multiple times when I tried to have an ai give me a gap fill ready to go and then found errors in it while trying to use it with a student. I think the time I was most impressed was when I asked it to give me a story very tailored to my student's specific job and it was able to do this fairly competently.

AI: Those are really telling examples - the frustration of discovering errors mid-lesson versus the satisfaction when it nailed that personalized story for your student's profession.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I think AI could take over teaching ESL, but I've actually tried to use it to help me learn french (chat gpt, the free one) and I got too annoyed and stopped. For teaching language, I expect it to get better but right now I think the human touch is very valuable in this realm for keeping students engaged because of the way our brains are hardwired. I think it could potentially take over if AI developed more human simulating characteristics so students really felt like they were talking to a human.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - you've experienced AI from both sides, as a teacher using it and as a language learner yourself. The engagement and human connection aspect seems crucial for language learning.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm really not sure...I could potentially use it to create more elaborate study materials using image generation, but right now image generation is too flawed to really be useful.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the human element remains crucial for student engagement in language learning, and how your own experience as a language learner with AI gave you that unique vantage point.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a content creation tool while maintaining control over the pedagogical structure, and especially your observations about the importance of human engagement in language learning, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
