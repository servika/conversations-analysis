Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm working with Anthropic's research team today. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

Just so you know, anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, lets begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically, I use it for advanced troubleshooting and coding. As an example, some of these things recently I have used AI for is building a Linux server with OpenSSL installed on it, configuring the client configurations for OpenSSL, and installing or uploading the information to the client VPN profile. I have used it for remediation of IT-related issues as well, such as helping determine the cause of a hardware failure and where best to begin troubleshooting efforts.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI for some pretty complex technical work. 

When you say you use it for "advanced troubleshooting," can you walk me through what that actually looks like? For instance, when you were dealing with that hardware failure, how did you and the AI work through determining the cause together?

User: Well we had an HP server delivered to our office, and upon trying to initialize it, the device wasn't detecting the hard drive. I collaborated with AI, pitching the issue to AI since I was unfamiliar with these new HP server models. AI assisted me with installing\updating firmware, verifying the hard drives were slotted in accurately, and providing me with technical resources such as documentation for further troubleshooting steps.

AI: That's a great example of working through a complex problem. When you say you "collaborated" with the AI on this server issue - what did that back-and-forth actually look like? 

Were you going step by step together, or did you describe the whole situation upfront and then work through the AI's suggestions one by one?

User: The second option, I provided the whole situation upfront, then we went through each troubleshooting step together. I would ask the AI if it could clarify on, for example, Step 2 of the process, then have it breakdown that specific troubleshooting method.

AI: That gives me a clear picture of your process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your IT work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Usually if I know how to do it, I'll do it myself. Mundane trouble tickets such as reinstalling programs or resetting a password isn't something that AI needs to be involved with nor could really help me there, since AI can't really automate resettomg a unique password that is user-set for instance.

AI: That makes sense - you're distinguishing between things AI can actually help with versus routine tasks you already know how to do. 

When you do turn to AI for those more complex issues like the server troubleshooting, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people around you use it similarly, or is there a particular attitude toward AI tools in your workplace?

User: I feel like in our neck of the woods (that is to say, IT in general) it's extremely uncommon. I haven't really told anyone that I've used AI before, but my colleagues know it exist but aren't as familiar with the capabilities of it as I am.

AI: Interesting - so you're kind of pioneering this on your own. Since you mentioned you haven't really told anyone you've used AI before, what's behind that decision? Is it more about workplace culture, or are there other reasons you keep that part of your process to yourself?

User: I think it's workplace culture really. As much as it pains me to say it, there does exist a sense of 'elitism' that persists in the workforce. Using AI could be seen as a sign of 'weakness' so-to-speak, if that makes any sense (even if I don't agree with it and consider it a valuable tool). I think this is probably because AI is still relatively new in the grand scheme of things.

AI: That does make a lot of sense, and it sounds like you're navigating some real tension there between finding AI genuinely valuable and the workplace perception of it. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The OpenSSL project I mentioned earlier. While it was my idea, I still would not be able to have set this up on my own without AI assistance (or at the very least, it would have taken me much longer to get this setup). AI assisted with helping me navigate Linux command line really well, and made it so utilizing the SSL VPN with clients was a breeze. That was probably the most extensive project that I've used AI on, as it was about 20 different remote client branches I had to connect.

AI: That sounds like a significant accomplishment - managing SSL VPN connections for 20 remote branches is no small feat. What specifically made that experience so satisfying? Was it the scope of what you were able to achieve, or something else about how the collaboration with AI worked in that situation?

User: I think just being able to collaborate with AI in that regard to accomplish something significant for a single person to do was what made it so satisfying. It really took a lot of the pressure off of me, and I got to feel like I was working with an expert in the field on getting that setup.

AI: That's a really powerful way to describe it - feeling like you were working with an expert. It sounds like AI has become quite a valuable partner for you in tackling complex projects.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you use these tools more?

User: I don't think AI is quite ready to take over the IT arena anytime soon. There are always going to be tech-related issues and people who have them that prefer a personal human touch rather than just an email. Even still, if that does take over, someone will still need to be able to fix issues within the AI or issues that surface with the AI, so I don't think it's really a risk that needs to be considered in my field.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on the human element that will always be needed. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently, or maybe more openly, as time goes on?

User: I've always liked utilizing AI, and will probably continue to use it for more projects I consider out-of-scope than my normal day-to-day would entail. As far as what those projects would be... I'm not too sure as client requests change daily. I imagine a lot of future collaboration projects would be for operating systems I'm not familiar with though.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI feels like working with an expert, and how you're navigating the workplace culture around AI use while still finding it genuinely valuable for complex projects.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative expert for complex technical projects, while navigating the cultural dynamics in IT workplaces, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through those detailed examples - it gives us a much clearer picture of how AI is being integrated into real-world technical work. Thanks again!
