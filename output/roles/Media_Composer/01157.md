Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: OK, that sounds fine

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: So I'm a musician, composer, and sound designer for short films, theatre, podcasts ocassionally. Depending on the project, I could be composing and producing music, creating sound effects, or writing songs.

AI: That's fascinating - you work across so many different mediums. It sounds like each project probably brings its own unique creative challenges.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sometimes, if I'm stuck with lyrics for a song (not my strong point!) I will discuss the themes and relevance within the piece with ChatGPT, or sometimes I will write some words and ask the model to continue. I then edit these heavily, sometimes completely ditch them but usually I at least get a new idea to spark my own process.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI more as a creative catalyst than as a final output generator. The fact that you edit heavily or sometimes completely ditch what it gives you suggests you're maintaining a lot of creative control.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI this way? What was the theme or context you were working with, and how did that interaction with the AI actually feel for you in the moment?

User: I recently worked as Music Director for a youth theatre production. I spent most of my time on arranging music for the young musicians in the cast but I also had to write two original songs using ideas that were brainstormed with the cast of the show. I took the themes and ideas we had discussed and gave the info to ChatGPT and asked, and regenerated the lyrics for the songs. I brought back a couple of versions to the cast and together we edited them together to get the finished songs. The music had already been written.

AI: That's a really collaborative approach - involving the cast in both the initial brainstorming and the final editing process. 

When you brought those AI-generated lyric versions back to the cast and you were all editing together, how did that feel as a creative experience? Were you thinking about the AI's contribution differently than you might think about, say, if another human collaborator had written those initial drafts?

User: Not really. It is different but I treated it the same as if a person had written the lyrics.

AI: That's really telling - you approached it as just another collaborator in the creative process. 

When you're working with AI in that collaborative mode, how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions? Is it you, the AI, the cast, or something else entirely?

User: In that particular role, when I'm working with kids I always try to let them be the real creators and make final decisions as much as possible. AI is just an interesting tool. Before widespread availability or AI I might have used a poem or passage from a book as a starting point in those sitauaitons

AI: That's a great perspective - framing AI as just one of many creative starting points you might use, like a poem or book passage. It sounds like your role as facilitator with the kids remains the same regardless of the tool.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Has it shifted how you approach certain parts of your process, or has it mostly just added another option to your toolkit?

User: It's just another colour on the palette I think. It has somewhat sped up that part of the process but not changed the process as a whole

AI: That "another colour on the palette" is a really nice way to put it. You mentioned it's sped up that lyric-writing part of your process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field? Are there aspects of music composition, sound design, or the creative process in general that you think about when it comes to AI?

User: I'm not really concerned about it. I'm not that interested in seeing art being made entirely by AI. It's interesting as a novelty but art is very human and should remain so.

AI: That's a clear perspective - valuing the human element as essential to what makes art meaningful to you.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll find new ways to integrate it, or do you expect it to remain pretty much as it is for you now - that additional color on the palette?

User: I don't plan to use it more, but I also never really planned to use it in the first place. So, I'm keeping my options open. I'm interested to see how AI can be used to make new tools for music making but not music made by AI

AI: That distinction is really interesting - being open to AI-powered tools for music making rather than AI making the music itself. It sounds like you see potential in AI enhancing the creative process without replacing the human creative decision-making.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI like any other collaborative starting point - whether that's a poem, book passage, or ChatGPT - and how you maintain that human-centered approach especially when working with young people.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really, thats about the extent to which I use it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as just another creative starting point - like a poem or book passage - and maintaining that human-centered approach to the creative process will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've described your approach, especially the way you facilitate creativity with young people while keeping them as the primary decision-makers. Thanks again!
