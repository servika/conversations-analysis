Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. Let's begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do a lot of data entry and research work as a virtual assistant. I need to find different sources of information from schools and high schools in the US. AI helps me to locate the right kind of schools for this information. I will ask it for schools based on certain parameters and it will give me a list that I can then use to research for the information I need.

AI: That sounds like a really practical application. When you ask AI for schools based on certain parameters, what kinds of parameters are you typically working with? Are you looking for specific geographic regions, school types, or other characteristics?

User: Most are based on language parameters. I need to know about the language departments of colleges and high schools and so will need information based on what they have available. Sometimes it is geography based. For example, I needed to know a list of schools in the Florida area that offer ASL as an option. It provided me a list and I could then use it to find out further information about each school.

AI: That's a really specific use case - focusing on language departments and ASL programs. When you get that initial list from AI, what does your research process look like from there? How do you go about gathering the further information you need about each school?

User: That was just one example, but another really specific use case can be about searching for coordinators of different languages such as "spanish 101 coordinators". I will look through the list and take the name, or school details to Google search them and then extract the required information after confirming it is correct on the school website.

AI: So you're using AI as that first step to generate leads, then doing your own verification and deeper research. When you're going through this process of checking the AI-generated information against the actual school websites, how often do you find that the AI got something wrong or missed something important?

User: I typicaly find that it is very good early on. For example, I asked Chat GPT to give me a list of 50 high school language coordinators in Florida. The first 50 were mostly good and were accurate. A few were outdated, but it was okay as they'd only just recently changed and I could easily track where they had gone to. When I asked for more the quality started dipping. It offered names that were made up and also more and more duplicates.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like there's a quality threshold where the AI starts to struggle. When you hit that point where you're getting made-up names and duplicates, how do you handle that? Do you stop asking for more, or do you have strategies for working around those limitations?

User: The first few times it would happen I would keep asking for additional lists and hope to still get a few nuggets I could use. Now, I can see when it is starting this so I will adjust my query if possible. On some tasks the scope is much bigger, such as US colleges all over America I can just adjust the search terms, or the geography.

AI: You've really developed a feel for when the AI is reaching its limits. When you adjust your query to work around those limitations, what kinds of changes do you typically make? Are you narrowing the geographic scope, changing how you phrase the request, or something else entirely?

User: It depends on the task. Most of the time it is not a problem due to how I can still do searches in many other places. I just change the geography. I have many languages where I need information from so I can also just change the search terms such as Spanish to Chinese.

AI: It sounds like you've built a really systematic approach to working with AI - you've got multiple dimensions you can adjust when one approach hits its limits. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain parts of this research process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: The biggest thing is just making sure the information is accuracy. I can't trust the AI to always deliver up to date information, for example, on who is teaching a certain subject, or who is the current German coordinator. I use it as a quick way to visually see a lot of useful information, but still need to manually check it is correct before I can enter it into the system.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're treating it as a research accelerator rather than a source of truth. When you're doing that manual verification step, is that something you actually prefer to do yourself, or is it more that you feel you have to because the AI isn't reliable enough yet?

User: I think the latter. I would prefer it would be completely correct and up to date, but this hasn't proven the case yet and for the kind of job I do the accuracy of data is very important.

AI: So if the accuracy were there, you'd be happy to delegate more of that verification process. When you use AI for work like this, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it one request and then go work independently with what it gives you?

User: Potentially, yes. I will input my initial request for names, schools or courses and ask for a number like 50. I will make my way down that list and then if the data is still good I will ask it for more results, or if not start a new chat.

AI: Interesting - you mentioned starting a new chat when the data quality drops. Is that because you find the AI performs better with a fresh start, or is there another reason you approach it that way?

User: Hmm, I think I am very much a creature of habit so have always done it like this. I find it visually better too to start a new chat, a clean page so to speak. I might find it slightly overwhelming if it was long pages of detail over and over again.

AI: That makes sense - having that visual organization can really help keep track of different searches. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your workplace has particular expectations or guidelines around AI use?

User: I started doing this kind of work around 11 years ago so it is definitely something we have only really started taking advantage of in the last couple of years. I would say it has improved our overall efficiency to a decent level. There are no set guidelines in place as everyone is trusted to carry out the work independently and there has been no issues so far.

AI: So you've seen this work evolve quite a bit over the years - from doing it entirely manually to now incorporating AI. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It has been more satisfying than frustrating overall I would say. I was satisfied recently when it helped me locate a lot of ASL teachers that quickly for one project I was working on. The most common source of frustration is when it offers poor data. For example, I wanted 50 coordinators in Florida of ASL programmes and it was duplicating and hallucinating names in the set of results.

AI: It sounds like that hallucination issue can be pretty disruptive to your workflow. When that happens, does it make you question the entire list it provided, or have you developed ways to spot which entries are likely to be accurate versus fabricated?

User: No, I can usually trust the initial results will be helpful. When I come across an instance like this then I won't immediately throw away the data, but I will become aware of it and make sure that each result after this is double checked for accuracy as it usually becomes a slippery slope after this.

AI: That's a smart approach - using that first hallucination as a warning signal. You mentioned you've been doing this type of work for 11 years, so you have a lot of experience doing it without AI. How do you think about maintaining your research skills in areas where AI is now helping you? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think the combined approach of using AI and then also manually researching does this. I don't feel like a passenger with the work and still feel like I need to be actively involved to ensure accuracy and to steer the tools at my disposal to get this accuracy.

AI: That's a great perspective - you're maintaining your role as the quality controller and strategist rather than just becoming passive. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in ways that would impact how you approach this research work?

User: I'm not sure. For the foreseeable future I know it will be used to get ready for the Spring 26 semesters, but after this it may evolve. These are discussions that could still be had, but it probably depends on the feedback from me and others in how we are finding using AI.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you've learned to recognize when AI quality starts to decline and use that as a signal to adjust your approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that is all from me. Thank you the interesting interview.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing that intuitive sense for AI quality thresholds and using AI as a research accelerator while maintaining your role as the accuracy gatekeeper will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and limitations you've encountered. Have a great rest of your day!
