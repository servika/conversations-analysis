Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, sounds good. No questions from me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I teach IT at college, so I use it for heavy admin tasks that would otherwise take hours of my day, things like drafting schemes of work, making lesson plans and resources. I also use it for quality checking from time to time, making sure my teaching materials align with the examining body's specifications and requirements. It gives me more time by doing the boring parts, so I can focus on my teaching.

AI: That sounds like AI is really helping you reclaim time for the parts of your job you find most meaningful. 

When you mention using it for "quality checking" - can you tell me more about that process? How do you actually go about having AI review whether your materials align with those specifications?

User: I have to make sure everything that I do aligns with the learning aims specified and the criteria that all have to be explicitly in the materials I use. I'll draft a resource, for example, a lesson presentation, and then I use AI to check whether what I've written links clearly to the right learning aim or criterion by giving the AI the part of the specification that I need it to align with, then use that to further adjust the lesson if needed.

AI: That's a really systematic approach. It sounds like you're using AI as a kind of quality assurance partner to catch alignment issues you might have missed.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There's definitely parts that I wouldn't hand over to AI, things like marking work, because that judgement is difficult to make, it's not always a black and white decision whether a student's work meets the criteria or not. The AI might be great at helping me come up with feedback once I have made that judgement, but other than that, it's usually not very consistent with making a call on directly grading a student's work.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - you're comfortable using AI to help generate feedback once you've made the assessment decision, but not to make that initial judgment call itself.

When you do use AI for tasks like drafting lesson plans or creating resources, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task to handle independently?

User: I usually prefer it to be a collaboration, I don't just hand over a whole task and let it do its thing. For example, for a lesson plan I'd start with a clear structure in mind, then use AI to draft sections or generate activities based on that, and refine and adjust as I go along. Same with the resources and worksheets, AI gives me the skeleton, but I add the detail, examples, and adjustments that make it work best for me and my students. The way I use it changed a lot since I first used it back when it became a thing, it's less of a replacement for my brain and more of an extension to it.

AI: That's fascinating - you mentioned that the way you use it has changed a lot since you first started. It sounds like you've moved from seeing it as a replacement to viewing it more as an extension of your thinking.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: It's still very mixed within my workplace, staff in IT and digital are generally more confident, but others are too hesitant or just don't know how to use it, I wouldn't say the workplace culture around using AI had a significant influence on me. I've been sharing how I use AI to make admin tasks quicker, and that has sparked conversations with colleagues to then start experimenting with AI tools.

AI: It sounds like you've become something of an informal champion for AI use among your colleagues. That's interesting that you're leading those conversations rather than following workplace directives.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think it's always the tasks that would ordinarily take me days to complete to a good standard that are the most satisfying when done. Using AI to make full schemes of work always feels like a win, and going from hours spent on just a draft to a final version in about the same time is amazing. The process and the right approach has definitely taken me a few weeks to perfect, which felt frustrating at first, but the result was worth it. There were times were the output looked polished and well-structured at first, but it took longer to fix that it would have taken me to write one from scratch. Now I can sit and create a final scheme of work in under 5 hours.

AI: That's a really compelling example - going from hours just for a draft to having a final version in that same timeframe. It sounds like there was definitely a learning curve to figure out the right approach.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do think about it, but I don't see AI replacing my skills anytime soon, it's more about refocusing my energy to the more important things in life. For example, I still plan lessons and map criteria myself, but I let AI handle the first draft so I can spend more time refining. The core teaching skills, judging student work, or adapting lessons on the spot can't be outsourced. For me it's less about maintaining skills for the sake of it, and more about using the AI to make the boring parts of the job easier.

AI: That perspective makes a lot of sense - using AI to handle the less engaging parts so you can focus your energy on what really matters in teaching.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I see it becoming more seamless, less of a separate tool that I dip into and more of an extension that works alongside me and my workflow. Right now I use it for drafting and checking, in future, I'd like it to connect directly with the systems I use so it can take over more of the admin tasks, like managing submissions or tracking grades, to free me up even more to focus on supporting my students, which is what actually makes a difference.

AI: That vision of seamless integration is really interesting - moving from AI as a separate tool to something that's woven directly into your existing systems and workflow.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how your approach has evolved from seeing AI as a replacement to viewing it more as an extension of your thinking, and how you've maintained clear boundaries around where human judgment remains essential.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I'd just like to add that the biggest value for me has been the time it gave me back. Teaching comes with endless admin, and AI doesn't replace the human side of the job, but it does make the workload easier to manage.

AI: That's a perfect summary and really captures something important - AI helping to make the workload more manageable rather than fundamentally changing what teaching is about.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between efficiency and maintaining the human elements of teaching will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thanks! :)

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day, and thanks again for being part of this research. :)
