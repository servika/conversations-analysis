Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds all good to me. Thanks

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in an urban farm as a horticulturist. I do various activities but they generally are all physical and related to maintenance and caretaking of the gardens and outdoor recreation areas. This can include weeding and maintaining spaces for aesthetic reasons but also for conservation reasons like preserving native species and keeping the grounds as organic as possible. Since I live in Australia but am from the US, there are plenty of species here that I am unfamiliar with and I sometimes need help identifying which species are native or invasive. I usually have the information at hand or can ask another professional nearby, but for the sake of efficiency I will sometimes request help from AI to identify if the species I am weeding is native or invasive and it is very useful. Other times, I quickly use it to maybe determine the best pruning method for a particular species or for animal species identification as well.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a quick identification tool in the field sounds incredibly practical. When you're out there trying to determine if a plant is native or invasive, what does that interaction with AI typically look like? Are you describing the plant to it, taking photos, or something else?

User: I take a photo and ask the AI to identify if the species is native or invasive and to give a taxonomic name and a common name of the species and that really helps me to determine if I should take it or leave it.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - getting that quick taxonomic and native status information right on the spot. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do prefer generally to figure most things out myself, especially more hyper-specific things like where is the best place to put this compost and which areas of the park need more attention for plant nutrition and things like that. Those are things that AI could possibly help with but I would have to feed considerable information to it that is hyper-specific that I just don't have time to do and also am not willing to do because that's the main joy of my job.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like the more site-specific, nuanced decisions are where you find the most satisfaction in your work. You mentioned that's "the main joy of my job." 

Tell me more about that - what is it about making those kinds of decisions yourself that brings you joy?

User: For me, it

AI: I'm listening - please go ahead and finish that thought.

User: Sorry. For me, it is the creative side of the job that is the reason I got into it. Working with my hands is very important to me and such an intuitive way of being that I don't want to sacrifice that in any way. Like, that's what makes my decisions as a human so important because I have that knowledge that I have gained with experience and time. That specific knowledge of the place that I work and the grounds I maintain is not transferable immediately. It takes time to gain that knowledge and I am proud to enjoy that creative dynamic. Oftentimes, the curiosity to find a solution is the most stimulating part of the job that allows me to play off of past experiences and think, "well, that worked last time but it's not working now. Why?" That's the fun part about figuring something out is that i has yet to come and the solution is satisfying to find.

AI: That really captures something profound about your relationship with your work - that experiential knowledge you've built over time and the creative problem-solving process. It sounds like there's almost a dialogue between you and the land itself.

When you do use AI for those quick identification tasks, how does that fit into this creative process? Does it feel like it supports your intuitive work or does it feel separate from it?

User: Exactly! I have a strong relationship to the land. In fact, I did a whole research project on how land and human have an emotional bond that we have lost in some way. But anyways, AI feels wholly separate from that process. I would rarely integrate AI into that problem-solving process unless I am truly stumped which has happened before but its pretty rare. And to identify the species that I am photographing is not creative to me, it's purely a scientific aid so in that sense it is separate from my intuitive work but I guess it still supports some future knowledge to know that that particular species is now verifiably invasive/native.

AI: That distinction you're making is really clear - using AI as a scientific tool for factual identification versus the creative, intuitive work that forms the heart of what you do. It sounds like AI serves more as a reference book might, rather than as a collaborator in your problem-solving.

When you use AI for those identification tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it, or do you tend to ask your question and move on once you get the answer?

User: Yes, AI is a reference for me like a deeper google search not a creative partner. For my work, I tend to just ask the question and move on without further questions unless sometimes I am particularly curious about the origin of an invasive species and am feeling curious about how it got into my region of Australia which I sometimes ask.

AI: That quick, reference-style interaction makes complete sense for your workflow. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other people at the urban farm use it similarly, or have you seen different approaches?

User: I would say it is slightly taboo to use AI. Not in the way I use it, but it certainly has stigma since we do such physical labor and are very environmentally based which can sometimes contradict the essence of AI. So, I try to avoid it and ask a colleague first but if I am the only one working that day or no one else is around at the moment I will quickly ask. Again, I use AI pretty infrequently for my job. I don't know of others who do the same, but I would assume they also do it from time to time, but it is certainly not favored.

AI: That's a really interesting tension - the environmental values and hands-on ethos of your workplace creating some friction with AI use, even when it's just for quick factual lookups. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There's a really similar species of grass. One is an invasive weed and another is a native species and they can grow into each other and form dense mats. I'm sorry that I'm blanking on the names of the species right now, but you have to know which is which in order to separate them and rid the mat of the invasive stems. I asked AI on how to identify the difference between the two and it gave me very specific identification methods that were extremely useful and allowed me to carefully remove the invasive parts. That was satisfying for sure.

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI serving as that scientific reference tool you described - helping you with the precise identification knowledge you needed to do the hands-on, careful work of separating the species. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't really consider this or worry about this too much considering all of my work is so human-based, communal-based, and hands-on that it feels almost impossible to replicate by a non-human entity. That makes me feel pretty secure. I guess I don't want AI to infringe anymore on the process of problem solving in my job and I would like to keep it as separate as possible or maintain its separation as a helping entity that does not influence the creative work process.

AI: That sense of security in the irreplaceable nature of your hands-on, experiential work really comes through. It sounds like you've found a clear boundary that works for you.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue using it in the same limited way, or do you see that changing?

User: I don't see it changing. If anything, I will likely try and stop using it entirely just to be fully present in the moment as I'm working and I am using it less and less as time goes on and I am verify capable of identifying species without any help.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that creative, intuitive relationship with the land and how you've established such clear boundaries around where AI fits - and doesn't fit - into your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think it's important to note that I also have great privilege with my work that allows me to feel so secure. I know that there are plenty of other spaces that do not have such freedom to keep AI in a box and I am sure that my habits would change if I had a different type of job that necessitated AI more. I guess, that is just me saying that it's way more gray than just using AI or not and my habits could definitely change in the future.

AI: That's such an important point - the recognition that your ability to keep AI at arm's length is connected to the nature of your work and the privilege that comes with that. It really highlights how context-dependent these relationships with AI are.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the tension between environmental values and AI use, the importance of maintaining that creative, hands-on connection to your work, and the broader context of privilege in AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
