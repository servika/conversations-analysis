Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am an iOS developer, so I use AI in my work. For example, I utilize Cursor and Xcode's AI code completion to help me complete various programming tasks. I also use AI for meeting summaries and drafting emails. Additionally, I rely on AI for research; for instance, if I need to implement a new feature, I use AI to find existing libraries or packages I can leverage or to identify APIs. I also use AI for brainstorming.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses across different aspects of your development work. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When it comes to programming, I delegate simple tasks to AI for example, a minor UI changes etc. but for more complex tasks e.g connecting to an API and fetching data correctly etc I prefer to do them myself with the assistance of AI for code completion, this is because I find that for more complex task there is a higher chance that the AI will get it wrong then you end up spending more time debugging and prompting that it would have taken to write the code yourself.  I think what makes tasks different is the complexity, especially when working on larger applications where there is a lot of things that need to be taken into context

AI: That's a really insightful distinction about complexity and context. It sounds like you've developed a pretty clear sense of where that threshold is for you.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: typically I will delegate smaller tasks, but for more complex task I collaborate with it thought the task

AI: That makes sense - so it sounds like the complexity really drives how you engage with it.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Communication has improved a lot. In the past, we needed to revisit already discussed issues frequently, but with AI taking meeting notes, communication is a lot smoother, and people can easily refer back to what was discussed in previous meetings. Overall, there is less friction in the workplace, and productivity has also improved.

AI: That's a really interesting point about AI improving team communication and reducing friction. It sounds like the meeting notes feature has had a broader impact beyond just individual productivity.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I once spent several hours bugging, but before I could commit my changes, I requested AI to make a very minor change to the code, only for it to re-introduce the bug it also changed the tests so that they passed, fortunately I noticed but this was very frustrating because it had done something that I hadn't asked it to do, which would have been very costly if shipped to production.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - especially since you hadn't asked it to make those broader changes and it modified the tests too. That could have been a real disaster if it had slipped through.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I consider this often, its very frustrating that one still has to maintain skills that AI could potentially take over because right now AI is not yet good enough for people to completely rely on it but at the same time, if you give it a couple more years of development, it will be able to take over those skill sets. Right now to be a good programmer you need to be able to work with or without AI

AI: That tension you're describing sounds really challenging - having to maintain skills that might become obsolete while also needing to master working with AI. It's like you're having to be proficient in both worlds simultaneously.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision working on things at a high level and having AI implement the low-level details. I envision being able to delegate more and more work to AI, which would increase productivity.

AI: That's a compelling vision - moving toward more strategic, high-level work while AI handles the implementation details.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how complexity determines whether you delegate or collaborate, and that frustrating example about the bug being reintroduced really highlighted the trust and oversight challenges.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nothing else from my side

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the complexity threshold for delegation versus collaboration, the workplace communication improvements, and especially that example about the debugging frustration will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
