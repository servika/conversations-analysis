Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.  No questions, I'm just ready to get started!

AI: Perfect! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a writer! I'm in the process of working on my debut novel right now, so I'm deep in the trenches of writing and editing my manuscript. Therefore, I have to come up with things like a title, characters, plot, etc.

AI: That's exciting - congratulations on working on your debut novel! That's such a significant milestone.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I don't allow myself to use AI for the creative meat and potatoes of my story, because I want it to be authentic to me. However, I do find myself looking for help for titles in my work by giving AI a synopsis of my story. I also tend to go to it to come up with names that sound good for siblings, last name ideas, things like that which aren't as crucial to the creative part of my work.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making between the "creative meat and potatoes" and those supporting elements. 

Can you describe a specific recent example where you used AI for one of these tasks? What was that experience like - how did you approach it and what happened?

User: I was really struggling with a title for my book. I had everything else, my story was well rounded, but nothing was sticking out within my work that would make the perfect, catchy title. I used AI to brainstorm, which then got my creative juices flowing, and I bounced back and forth with it until we found a perfect title.

AI: That's fascinating - you describe it as bouncing back and forth until "we" found the perfect title. 

Tell me more about that collaborative process. What did that back-and-forth look like, and how did you know when you'd landed on the right one?

User: So, I started by basically saying, "here's the plot of my story, here's something significant that happens in it, here are the main characters' namds

AI: I can hear you were starting to explain the process - it sounds like you gave the AI some key story elements to work with. Please go ahead and finish that thought - I'd love to hear more about how that conversation unfolded.

User: Sorry, hit send on accident! Let me start over. So, I started by basically saying, "here's the plot of my story, here's something significant that happens in it, here are the main characters' names, can you help?" AI then gave me some ideas, none of which sounded right. However, they did point out something minor from my story I mentioned, which gave me an idea. It was a play on a classic phrase that most people would probably know, but not all. I asked for advice on if it was clear what I was playing off of, and if AI thought people would get it. AI said they likely would, and gave me some similar ideas. One of the ideas it gave was almost perfect, so I changed one word and got a title I love.

AI: That's such an interesting process - it sounds like the AI helped you see your own story from a different angle by highlighting something you'd mentioned but maybe hadn't fully considered as title material.

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe who or what is driving the creative decisions? How does that feel to you as the writer?

User: Personally, I feel like the way I use it still allows me to drive the creative decisions. I'm mostly using it as a way to force myself to look at things from a different angle. As a writer, or a creative person in general, it's really important to me to stay in control of the creative decisions and use AI solely to see my work in a different way, kind of like if I was bouncing ideas off of another writer over coffee.

AI: I love that analogy - like bouncing ideas off another writer over coffee. That really captures something important about how you're approaching this collaboration.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI in this way?

User: I think that I spend less time stressing over minor things and more time actually writing and being creative when I don't have to do the "parts" that don't come as naturally to me, like coming up with a title or making sure names fit together. I have a tendency to get stuck on certain elements like that, and I lose focus and motivation. Now, they're more streamlined and less of a pain point for me.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI has helped you move past some of those creative blocks that used to derail your momentum.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of writing?

User: I do fear that AI could take over writing. I know that may not happen soon, as using AI, I know it currently isn't quite as capable of producing what a naturally talented writer could. In other words, I know the difference between an AI story and a human's work they've poured their heart into almost immediately. There are markers that give it away, you know? But, I also know AI gets smarter every day, so it's not unlikely. I think for a while, there will be some push back from the audience at least that wants something from real live authors as opposed to AI, so that gives me some hope. I like to think AI can just continue to find new ways to help us without being the driving force in someone's creative process, but only time will tell.

AI: You raise such thoughtful points about the tension between AI's evolving capabilities and that human authenticity that readers seem to value. It sounds like you're cautiously optimistic about finding that balance.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll expand how you use it, or do you see yourself sticking to these boundaries you've established?

User: I think, for my given occupation, it'll stay about the same. I think AI will continue to grow and get smarter as we continue to train it, so maybe I'll end up with things like strong titles without a lot of back and forth that starts with some more cheesy ideas. However, like I said, I wish to remain the creative powerhouse of the situation, so I'm not sure I'd ever just blindly take something AI created and slap it on my work as my own. I'd want to keep using it as a tool to get my creative juices flowing, not letting it create for me. Who knows, maybe there will be even more ways in the next couple years that it can assist me without giving up my creative edge, which will allow me to expand on how I use it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared, and you've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative process. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that boundary between using AI as a creative catalyst versus letting it drive the creative decisions - that coffee shop collaborator analogy really stuck with me.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's about all I have!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authenticity while using AI as a strategic tool - especially for those elements that used to create blocks in your workflow - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

Best of luck with your debut novel! It sounds like you've found a really thoughtful approach to integrating AI that supports rather than replaces your creative vision.
