Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, lets do it

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: i use it a lot - i work as a data analyst/biz partner type role, so if i am taked with an analysis project one of my first steps might be to put the brief into a bot and ask it to break it down into component tasks, or for suggestions on how to approach it. i might then ask for step by step instructions of how to manipulate the data if i want to do something with that data that im not immediately sure how to do. i might then ask for suggestions on how to word the insights, or rephrase headings of bullets in my slides that i'm not totally sure on

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI is woven throughout different stages of your analysis work. 

Tell me more about that first step where you put the brief into a bot and ask it to break things down. What does that interaction typically look like?

User: lets say ive been asked to look at the performance of X brand over the past few years to identify where we have lost page views, where the growth areas are etc, i might copy the entire brief/jira ticket into a chatbot (do you want to know which ones i use?) and ask for a step by step guide on how to approach the task

AI: Yes, I'd be curious to know which ones you use, but first - when you get that step-by-step guide back from the bot, what happens next? Do you follow it exactly, or does it change how you would have approached the analysis?

User: i would rarely follow it exactly, but i often get good ideas or elements i can use

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like you're using it more as a starting point for ideas rather than a complete roadmap. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: sometimes i enjoy actually messing around with the data myself, but tbh if i was confident the AI could do it for me (things it cant automatically do atm) then i probably would end up relying on it more and more for data analysis tasks. i am also wary about using it for text i'll be sharing, for fear of it sounding like AI/not like me, but not sure if this is because i enjoy doing the writing myself, or if its more just not wanting to look like i rely on AI too much

AI: That's a really honest reflection - the tension between efficiency and authenticity, plus the social dynamics around AI use. 

Tell me more about that concern of not wanting to look like you rely on AI too much. What do you think would happen if colleagues knew the extent to which you use it?

User: i have no idea! i sometimes read stuff from others and think, that sounds like AI, and judge them a bit (especially if something is just wrong, or makes them sound like they dont know what they'r talking about), but then i do it myself. i feel like ppl might be surprised how much i use it (like sometimes i forget a simple formula and ask the bot rather than googling it, or use it to do an instant message where i want some suggestions on exactly the right wording to use)

AI: That's such a relatable contradiction - judging others for what we also do ourselves. It sounds like there's this unspoken tension around AI use at work.

When you do use AI for those instant messages or wording suggestions, can you walk me through what that interaction looks like? How do you typically work with it to get the tone right?

User: i would say something like i want to write a message along the lines of'...' improve this for me, or suggest some alternative phrasings for me

AI: Got it - so you're giving it the general direction and asking for options rather than having it write from scratch.

When you use AI for work like this, could you describe your typical interaction pattern overall? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: more collaboration - i cant really think of complete tasks it could handle on its own (it cant do full decks, data analysis or messages i dont have to proofread)

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you're in constant dialogue with it rather than handing things off completely.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it more of an individual thing?

User: its a very hot topic at work

AI: Tell me more about that - what kinds of conversations are happening around AI at your workplace?

User: our CEO is very keen, and its one of our strategy pillars. we have working groups and trials set up to help people use gemini, and just today in our team meeting someone ran through their use of Gems to help with repetitive tasks. but there is also a negative side with our in-house AI software being used to rewrite articles, and a fear in the newsrooms that this is costing jobs (it probably is) and eroding content quality (also definately is)

AI: That's fascinating - you're right in the middle of this tension between leadership enthusiasm and newsroom concerns. It sounds like there are very real stakes around quality and jobs.

Given that you're in this environment where AI is both encouraged strategically but creating real concerns, how does that affect your own comfort level with using it? Does it make you more or less likely to use it in certain situations?

User: i dont realy have any qualms using it for my role - not hurting anybody, just helping me do my job better and quicker. i guess theres a longer term issue of how long before it (YOU!) could do all my tasks and make my employment market much tougher, but that feels a bit abstract for now (and not something i can do much about! hardly going to slow anything down if i decide to stop using it)

AI: That's a really pragmatic perspective - focusing on the immediate benefits while acknowledging the bigger picture uncertainty. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: satisfied when i saw how well it could put together a full google doc and collaborate on edits within the platorm. frustrated when i ask it how to do something in sheets, and it hallucinates a solution

AI: Those are such clear examples of when it works well versus when it falls short. When it hallucinates those spreadsheet solutions, what do you typically do? Do you try rephrasing, or do you just move on to other methods?

User: might try rephrasing once or twice, like saying 'i dont have that option'. will probably keep trying if its something i really need to do and am sure can be done, or may resort to google instead

AI: That makes sense - you've developed a good sense of when to persist versus when to cut your losses.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: not massively, i am focused on building and maintaing the skills i need for my current role, and thats the main thing. i think its difficult to predict exactly what might/might not be replaced by AI in some ways, but now im typing this maybe i should! maybe theres no point getting good at sheets and slides, and i need to focus on bigger picture strategy/leadership learning

AI: That's an interesting shift in thinking as you're talking through it - from not really considering it to wondering if you should be prioritizing different skills entirely.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think it will stay roughly the same as it is now, or do you see it changing?

User: will become used more and more, from what i can see from our CEO briefings. the gemini pilot only started a few months ago, and i know some teams dont even use it at all when they really should do. i think some stuff feels pretty close as well around its data analysis, doc creation and slide creation capabilities which would make it really really useful, and i would certainly look to leverage that

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your honest reflection on that tension between judging others for AI use while doing it yourself - and how you're thinking through the skill-building question in real time.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
