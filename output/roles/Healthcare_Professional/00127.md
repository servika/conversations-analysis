Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI to communicate with my patients and residents especially ways that involve those who have dementia or memory loss. I ask AI to come up with fun ways to get my residents and patients to find joy and to also help with deescalation techniques.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work. Tell me more about these interactions - when you're looking for ways to bring joy to residents or help with deescalation, what does that process look like for you?

User: Typically I want to create a fun and safe environment to tailor my patients experiences when I'm performing ADLs or looking for ways to keep them active such as balloon tossing or simple walks. Deescalation varies so much from one person to the next, it could be as simple as talking about what the resident does for work or as difficult as the resident not knowing who or where they are, so that leads to combative behaviors.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - each person needs such an individualized approach. When you're facing those varied deescalation situations, how do you typically work with AI to help you navigate them? Do you describe the specific situation you're dealing with, or do you approach it differently?

User: Well with those that are in the military or have dedicated their lives to service I ask AI what tasks are involved with their roles and we usually start talking about how their work day would move along and tasks they have to perform. Or if a difficult patient has become more combative I ask AI what I could do to calm down the mood or if I'm maybe not understanding the position they're in. I usually keep it pretty vague as to not reveal and personal information, but the situation itself is pretty specific like if my patient was eating dinner and threw their plate and food all over the floor.

AI: I can see how those specific scenarios help you get more targeted guidance. When you're in those moments - like when someone has just thrown their plate - do you find yourself turning to AI in real time during the situation, or do you typically consult it afterwards to prepare for similar situations in the future?

User: Afterwards with the more dramatic reactions because in those moments I am completely focused at the situation at hand. But for other moments I describe the situation and what I said and how I can handle it better in the future.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's a clear distinction between when you need to be fully present with the person versus when you can step back and reflect. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of patient care that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those different for you?

User: Not really. I feel like patient care is pretty hands on especially when it comes to ADL and real life situations. But when I'm confused, sad, or feel like a situation made my patient unhappy, then I definitely want to be a better caregiver/assistant.

AI: It sounds like you see AI as a resource for your own professional growth rather than something that could replace the direct, hands-on care you provide. When you do turn to AI because you're feeling confused or want to improve after a difficult situation, how would you describe that interaction? Are you bouncing ideas back and forth with AI, or are you more looking for it to give you complete suggestions to try?

User: I look to AI to give suggestions and I can tailor the responses a bit more like if the person hates singing or movies and AI suggests media..then I let AI know. But yeah I guess I like to bounce ideas back n forth.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth makes a lot of sense for your work. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI? Do others on your team talk about using it, or is it something you've figured out more on your own?

User: I don't believe my coworkers use AI as much as I do because it does take a certain type of compassionate person to want to be better for their patients. My coworkers haven't been open about using AI

AI: That's an interesting observation about the connection between compassion and wanting to improve through AI. Can you share a time when using AI for your patient care made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well one of my patients was frustrated over the temperature in her room and she would come out of her room over and over to ask why it's so cold. I had to talk to her and remind her that the temperature was unchanged many times and I had bounced ideas back n forth with AI to figure out what she really wanted. The solution ended up being that she just wanted someone to talk to and spend time with her. So I sat in her room with her and we talked about her photo album she had on her coffee table. I felt very good about that. She was calm and was able to stay in her room to rest afterwards.

AI: What a beautiful outcome - it sounds like AI helped you see past the surface complaint to understand what she really needed. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Wait what do you mean? Can you reword the question?

AI: Of course! I'm wondering - since you use AI to help you think through patient interactions and come up with approaches, do you ever worry about becoming too dependent on it? Or do you think about making sure you're still developing your own instincts and skills as a caregiver?

User: Nah I don't think I'll ever be too dependent on AI in my field. It's pretty hands on and really requires experience from around the way. I definitely work on developing my knowledge especially with those with memory issues.

AI: That makes sense - the human connection and real-world experience seems central to what you do. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you gain more experience?

User: Yes definitely I feel like language and communication are always evolving and I could use some help trying to understand those who are older and younger.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you understand what patients really need beneath their surface complaints, like with the woman who kept asking about the temperature but really just wanted companionship.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I can't think of anything currently. I felt like this was good insight!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a tool for compassionate care - helping you better understand and connect with your patients - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's clear that you've found a really meaningful way to integrate AI into your caregiving work while keeping the human connection at the center. Thanks again for participating!
