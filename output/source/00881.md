Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to create templates for emails and to help create invoices and quotes. I sometimes do the math with models vs using a calculator. I'll ask questions about different types of paint and how htey work. For example, if a house already has a semi-transparent stain on it, what will happen if a second semi-transparent stain is applied on top.

These uses are to help save time.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI across different aspects of your painting business, from the administrative side to the technical knowledge side.

Tell me more about how you decide when to use AI for math versus reaching for a calculator. What influences that choice for you?

User: Usually I have a model open, so it's faster to just ask it. A lot of the time my calculations aren't only related to math, so if I ask by using the model then it can answer my follow-up or related questions at the same time.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that context carry over for follow-up questions sounds really efficient.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to create messages and anything related to informal communication without the use of AI because the models do not sound natural or speak the way that I would. I also read all my incoming emails and paperwork, etc. without the use of AI summarizing it for me because I don't trust that something important might be missed or communicated inaccurately.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - wanting to maintain your authentic voice in informal communications and ensuring you catch all the important details in incoming information.

When you do use AI for work tasks like creating those email templates or getting technical paint advice, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it what you need and let it handle things independently?

User: I definitely go back and forth because I am making changes and updates as I go, or asking for further information or advice. I don't think the model usually ever gets things done exactly how I want them the first time, so I will explain further what I need. Everything that comes from me, I want to be up to my standard and therefore I don't feel comfortable giving up that full control for the model to handle things on its own.

AI: That collaborative approach really comes through - it sounds like you see AI as a partner in the process rather than something you hand tasks off to completely.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I don't think I've been influenced much at all by my colleagues or the workplace culture. I'm familiar with computers, and so it's just natural that I use them to help me with my work. I haven't been encouraged to use AI, nor have I been discouraged. It's not really a part of the work conversation ever.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you've really developed your own approach based on what works for you, without much external input either way.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The model constantly makes me feel both satisfied and frustrated. It makes me especially happy when it creates tables and templates for me because it's done so quickly. It saves me so much time and does a better job than I could. Then I can just fill in the information I want, or have the model do it. 
It's also constantly frustrating me when it doesn't understand what I'm asking for. Many times I know exactly what I want from the model, but it doesn't understand from how I'm communicating with it. It seems like sometimes when the model doesn't understand something, instead of stopping and regrouping, and figuring it out - it panics and hallucinates. It will say that it has completed what I've asked for, but it hasn't. That's really frustrating.

AI: That contrast is really vivid - the satisfaction when it nails something like creating tables quickly versus the frustration when it seems to "panic" and claim it's done something it hasn't actually accomplished.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: This is definitely something that is always on my mind, but I don't think I have any control over it. All I can do is continue to work and improve my knowledge/skills, and hope that it will still be useful in the future. I do, however, believe that human input will always be needed as I don't think the models will ever be able to completely act and speak like people do with each other. 
I've thought that maybe AI could take a large portion of my sector, but it will still need human oversight.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - the balance between the uncertainty of change and your belief that human oversight will remain essential.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: In the future I think AI will be able to complete all my tasks without needing me to fix it and fill in areas, or double check it. There will be a time when the models are just answering the questions or following the instructions as requested. This is when I won't be doing the work, but just overseeing the results from the models and work more as QA.

AI: That's a fascinating vision - moving from the collaborative back-and-forth you do now to more of a quality assurance role overseeing AI's work.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you maintain control and standards while still leveraging AI's efficiency, especially with those tables and templates.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that balance between collaboration and control, and your thoughtful approach to navigating both the benefits and frustrations of working with AI, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
