Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no, let's start

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: As a piano teacher I use it for creating specific practise exercises that my students can use for specific issues they have for a passage of music

AI: That's a really interesting application. Tell me more about that - what does the process look like when you're creating these exercises for a student's specific issue?

User: If a passage is challenging and the student can't play it well after repeated practise of the actual music, it implies that the student my lack certain skills that need to be aquired before playing that passage. The ai can a) explain the challenge with that passage b) what skills one requires and c) what kind of drills one can use to aquire those skills

AI: That sounds like a really thoughtful approach to problem-solving with your students. When you're working through this process with AI, how do you typically interact with it? Are you collaborating back and forth to refine the exercises, or do you usually give it the context and let it generate a complete solution?

User: The former, it takes several iterations. The first is to tell it the passage and as much detail as one can with words to describe the issue the student is having. I'd then ask some follow ups and soemtimes come up with more ideas for kinds of drills it can help me with.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth sounds really valuable. I'm curious - are there aspects of teaching piano or working with your students where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI might be able to help? What makes those areas different for you?

User: In the case described above, sometimes its analysis of the challenge is more useful to me than the actual drill suggestion that it provides. So I'm really using it for brainstorming the challenge then come up with solutions myself.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - using AI more as a thinking partner to analyze the problem rather than necessarily for the final solution. 

How have your colleagues or the broader piano teaching community influenced the way you approach using AI in your work? Have you encountered different attitudes or approaches among other teachers?

User: That would be a great idea. I have not yet spoken to other teachers using ai. I think I'm probably more tech savvy than the average piano teacher, but I'm sure sooner of later I'll find other teachers with new and creative ways of using ai for music teaching. But as of this point I've not found any.

AI: It sounds like you're pioneering this on your own right now. Can you share a time when using AI for creating these practice exercises made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes, there was a particular difficult passage in a Beethoven Sonata that was giving the student trouble. And until then I had not tried using ai, and it's explanation of the challenge and ideas about taking those changing broken chords and playing them as solid chords and focusing on the changes as opposed to the brokennes helped the student make progress. It also made a helpful point about using primarily the fingers as opposed to the wrist. These 2 points helped the student make progress in that particular passage.

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful breakthrough moment - both for your student's progress and for discovering what AI could offer your teaching. 

How do you think about maintaining your own skills in areas like analyzing musical challenges and creating exercises, given that AI can now assist with these tasks? Is this something you actively consider?

User: At this point the ai is a good asisstant and it helps increase my own skills of analysis. In a private music teaching situation, the teacher does not have someone to give him feedback and hence the teacher's skill may not improve that much. But by using the ai for generating ideas the teacher's skill can improve by learning new drills and analysis. So it clearly improves the skill of the teacher.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - using AI almost like a professional development tool to expand your own teaching toolkit. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI in your piano teaching evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I think a) the analysis and drills for teaching piano or just music in general will probably get better. b) the ai could come up with a animation showing how something should be done as opposed to providing the score c) the ai could visually see the student through the camera and analyse the student directly as opposed to the teacher typing in the issue to the ai.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in teaching. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as both an assistant and a tool for your own professional development - that's such an interesting way to think about the relationship.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your piano teaching that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Like many there is a fear that once the ai can watch a student and provide good feedback directly, what is the point of a human teacher? That is a concern that many have with the rise of ai, whatever their jobs may be.

AI: That's such an important point you've raised, and I imagine it's something many professionals across different fields are grappling with. Thank you for being so open about that concern - it adds a really valuable dimension to understanding how people are experiencing AI in their work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative thinking partner, the way it's actually enhancing your own teaching skills, and the honest reflection on future concerns will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
