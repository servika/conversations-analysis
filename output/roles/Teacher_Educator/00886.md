Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm an ESL Teacher of international adults at a language school in australia. I use AI mostly to help get ideas for lesson plans, generate lists of examples of grammar and language points, and to generate games

AI: That sounds like AI is really integrated into your lesson planning process. 

Tell me more about how you use it for generating games - what does that process typically look like for you?

User: usually i'll have an idea of the game that I want to do, e.g. charades or taboo, but i want it to be specific to the vocab or grammar we are learning that day. so i'll supply it with the necessary vocab or grammar topics and ask it to generate the style of game that i want

AI: That's a really specific way of customizing content for your students. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to grade student work and make slides myself. i like to have a clear idea of the kind of work my students are producing and making the slides myself really helps me to prepare for the lesson and plan what im going to say and how its going to go

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like those tasks give you important insights into your students and help you prepare mentally for class.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: it depends, if i need ideas for a lesson and i don't really know where I'm starting then it is definitely more collaborative. other times i know exactly what I want and ask the AI to do it to fit in to my plan that I already have

AI: So it sounds like your approach really depends on where you are in your planning process - more back-and-forth when you're brainstorming versus more direct requests when you have a clear vision.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: i have definitely talked to colleagues about using it for generating games and ideas, i would say the workplace culture around it is generally positive. it's great also for generating things really quickly in class, like if i have some spare time and want to give them discussion questions, i can just specify what kind of topic i want or grammar points and then it will instantly give me discussion question ideas, that kind of thing. it's great for the on the go nature of teaching and being flexible

AI: That real-time flexibility sounds really valuable - being able to adapt quickly when you have unexpected time or need to pivot during class.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: we had an excursion planned, but the original place we were supposed to go ended up not being viable. we had to switch to going to an art gallery at the last minute. it was definitely going to be a bit boring for the age range of my class (13 - 15) so i used AI to quickly generate a "goose chase" style photography hunt, and it worked great. it really helped me out when i was in a tight spot without much time to plan something from start to finish all by myself

AI: That sounds like a perfect example of AI helping you adapt under pressure and turn a potentially challenging situation into something engaging for your students.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: yeah, definitely. i want to make sure that I thoroughly understand the grammar that i teach, and that i'm not relying on constantly looking things up or asking AI to expain it for me. i also want to keep my writing skills sharp so that I can give good feedback to my students on their own writing

AI: That's really thoughtful - it sounds like you're being intentional about preserving the core expertise that makes you effective as a teacher.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: i'm not sure, im pretty happy with what i do so far. i guess i would hope that the games and thing that it does generate can be formatted more cleanly and without mistakes, because right now they come out a bit awkward and i still have to tweak them

AI: That makes sense - having cleaner, more polished output would save you that extra editing step.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps with that real-time flexibility that teaching demands, and how you're being intentional about maintaining your core skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope i think that's it

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance AI assistance with maintaining your teaching expertise, and especially how you use it for real-time adaptation in the classroom, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
