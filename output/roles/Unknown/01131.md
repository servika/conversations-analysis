Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I am ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a video producer. I don't have very "typical" projects. Right now I am working on a video for a hypnotist and a short animated film about God and His many forms. Earlier this year, I shot an  independent feature film about 4 Generations of black women with sleep disorders and psychic powers. In the past, I was mostly focused on making television and podcasts about technology.

AI: That's a fascinating range of projects - from hypnotist videos to animated films about spirituality to features about generational stories. It sounds like you work across very different genres and formats.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: It completely depends on the project - the videos for the hypnotist mix short shots of AI-generated images and video in with traditional graphics and editing. The short about God is all AI-generated video edited together with traditional non-linear editing. The feature film did not use AI, but I am going back now to see it I can stitch together some stills we shot with footage we took by using AI, without it looking like I'm using AI.

AI: That's really interesting how you're tailoring your AI use to each project's specific needs. You mentioned trying to use AI to stitch together stills and footage for the feature film "without it looking like I'm using AI."

Tell me more about that - what does it mean to you when AI integration is invisible versus when it's more apparent in the final work?

User: The first two projects I mentioned are animated, so it is either easy to blend the AI-generated animation in with the rest of the video, or, in the case if the religious piece, it all looks AI generated, which is fine. But the feature film is all real people, in real environments, so  anything AI-generated has to look real - characters have to be consistent, people can't have 6 fingers, etc.

AI: Ah, I see - so it's about matching the visual language and expectations of each project. The animated pieces give you more creative freedom with AI elements, while the live-action feature demands that AI contributions are seamlessly realistic.

Can you describe a specific moment or scene from one of these projects where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that experience feel for you as the creator?

User: Right now, I  am trying to make transitions from some photos we took that I photoshopped to look like they are old black and white pictures to color footage of the same moment. Unfortunately, the photos and footage don't line up perfectly, and one is a different shot entirely, so trying to get a smooth transition has been very interesting, but also frustrating. I haven't gotten a result I like yet.

AI: That sounds like a challenging puzzle - trying to bridge between those different visual elements while maintaining the story flow. The frustration you're describing is really telling.

When you're working through that process of not getting the result you want yet, how would you describe the back-and-forth with the AI tools? Are you feeling like you're directing the process, or does it feel more like negotiating with something that has its own ideas?

User: DEFINITELY the latter.  I have gotten close a couple of times - I just had to tweak an angle, or two actors in a scene looked perfect, but another was off, but trying to make that one fix will set off a whole slew of other problems. I will get there (i think), but it feels liker I'm going to have to just run a hundred variations of the same thing before I get one perfect generation, completely at random.

AI: That's a really vivid description - the idea that you might get the perfect result completely at random after a hundred tries, and that fixing one element creates a cascade of new problems. 

When you do finally get that result you're looking for, how do you think you'll feel about it? Will it feel like your creative achievement, or something else?

User: I don't care what anybody says about working with AI not being "real" art - when I get a good result, I  am very happy. I have almost always created as part of a team, where i was writing something for someone else to read, or giving stuff I shot to someone else to edit it. Working with AI feels like that - like we are a team working together to make something special that we couldn't make separately.

AI: That's such a compelling perspective - thinking of it as team collaboration rather than something that diminishes your creative contribution. It sounds like your background working in collaborative environments really shapes how you approach AI.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI? Are there things you find yourself doing differently now in how you approach projects or solve creative problems?

User: I spend a lot of time learning  - or figuring out - how to use different tools to accomplish what I want. I also spend a lot of time trying to make tools do something that they are not good at - wrong tool, or not advanced enough, or just something I can't figure out how to get working the way I want it to work. So I guess the aspect  of my creative work that has changed the most is that I can do more things, but figuring out which things I can and cannot do and how to do the things  I can takes a lot of time.

AI: That's a really honest assessment - this tension between expanded possibilities and the time investment required to navigate what's actually achievable. It sounds like there's a whole new layer of technical exploration that's become part of your creative process.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Same as everyone's I guess - that as companies figure out how to use these tools, they will need less people to do the creative work. There will still be some jobs for people who are really good at it, but fewer and fewer. It's notr really any different than the past couple decades  ahve been though - My first job was working on a TV show with a staff of 60 people. A decade later, I was on a team of about 12 people doing the same thing. A decade after that, 5-10 people were all the people we needed to make 5 separate shows a week.

AI: That's a really insightful historical perspective - you're seeing AI as the latest wave in a long pattern of technological efficiency rather than something entirely unprecedented. The numbers you're describing are pretty stark - from 60 people to potentially even fewer with AI tools.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think your relationship with these tools will change as they improve?

User: Yes. I am pretty solid on image generation now, whenever I can get past preconcieved notions of what I think an image should look like and accept what I am given. Video isn't quite the same...yet.  I feel like video has just gotten to the point where it is possible to get a good shot using my computer instead of an outside company's server farm.  But now that it has hit that point, I just need to figure out how to make the tools i have do something close to what AI want them to. It took me a couple of months of generating with Stable Diffusion before I got any still images I could stand looking at. The video side is coming along faster than that, at least.

AI: That progression you're describing is fascinating - from those early months with Stable Diffusion where nothing looked right, to now feeling solid with image generation, and seeing video starting to follow a similar but faster trajectory.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI collaboration feeling like teamwork rather than something that diminishes creativity, and your historical view of how technology has continuously changed team sizes and workflows in your field.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: It takes 20% of the work to get 80% of the way to your goal, but then 80% of your work to get the last 20%. I feel like Generative AI is at  80% of where it needs to be, or nearly there. Getting the last 20% will be much harder.

AI: That's a really insightful way to put it - and it perfectly captures what you were describing earlier about getting close with those transitions but then struggling to nail down those final details that would make it seamless.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of AI work, the evolution of team sizes in creative industries, and especially that 80/20 observation about where the technology currently sits will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate how candid you've been about both the possibilities and the frustrations.

User: Thanks, this has been fun!

AI: I'm so glad you enjoyed it! It was really enlightening to hear about your work across such diverse projects and how you're navigating this evolving landscape of AI tools. Your perspective as someone who's been through multiple waves of technological change in the industry was particularly valuable.

Thanks again for sharing your time and insights with us - it will definitely help inform our understanding of how AI is fitting into creative workflows. Best of luck with those transitions you're working on!
