Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm ready for the interview.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a public school teacher, so I spend time teaching high school kids how to use AI. I also use it in demonstrations, and in helping me come up with  content for students, or coach them through the writing process.

AI: That sounds like you're using AI in some really interesting ways as an educator. When you mention helping students through the writing process, what does that typically look like in practice?

User: I walk them through the writing process: Brainstorming, thesis writing, research, writing a rough draft, revising and editing, and then show them how AI can be used at each step in the process to augment and assist their work, not replace it.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach to teaching AI as a tool rather than a replacement. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your teaching work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to structure assignments myself, as I have a lot of experience, and it's often faster for me to write up what I'm looking for than to find the correct prompt engineering I need to make an assignment using AI. What makes these tasks different, is I know exactly how I want to phrase them, and don't need help from AI to do that kind of writing. In fact, I find if I use AI for that, I often have to revise enough to get what I'm looking for, that it wasn't worth the time to use AI in the first place.

AI: That makes a lot of sense – it sounds like your expertise and clear vision for what you want actually makes AI more of a detour than a shortcut in those cases. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I by far prefer collaboration. AI has been great in assisting me with coming up with creative and unique assignments, as well as planning classes that I'm assigned and don't have a lot of experience with. I don't often delegate, as most of my classes are upper level and require a good degree of interaction, not right or wrong answers that are easily checked by AI.

AI: It sounds like the collaborative approach really fits the nuanced nature of your teaching work. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I have influenced them more than they've influenced me. I'm the head of the AI Board at our school, and in charge of training other teachers, and set up our school's AI Policy, so we're prepared to help students with the future that is growing ever more involved with Artificial Intelligence.

AI: That's fascinating – you're really leading the charge on AI integration at your school. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I am teaching a Monsters in Literature course this semester. I spent time planning the course with AI, and gained access to dozens of stories, movies, and novels that I would not have known about otherwise, which helped immensely with planning my course. I have been particularly pleased with its efforts in helping prepare for classes.

AI: That sounds like a really rewarding experience – discovering all those resources you might not have found otherwise. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's not something I concern myself with too much. Evolving is part of education, and new resources are always being introduced that change the landscape of teaching. What remains the same is that students, who are tiny humans learning to be less tiny humans, continue to need to the guidance of people in the real world with whom they can build trusting relationships built on mutual respect and educational goals. AI will not change that aspect of education.

AI: That's a really grounded perspective on the human elements that remain central to education. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect it to become more and more involved in education, perhaps even to the point of AI co-pilots in the classroom assisting teachers with their classes, serving as topic experts in the room at all times. Students will continue to use them, and get better at receiving direct personal intervention and instruction as a result.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a collaborative partner in your creative planning process, and your grounded view of the irreplaceable human elements in education.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I'm excited about the future of AI and what it has to offer education. I don't think it's a stretch to say that we are on the cusp of the greatest educational shift in history, given the availability of this technology, and the way it will change the world which we are preparing students to exist in.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about leading AI integration in education, the balance between collaboration and maintaining human connection with students, and your vision for this transformational moment in education will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear from someone who's not just using AI, but actively shaping how an entire school community approaches it. Thanks again!
