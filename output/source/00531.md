Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, and I have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for helping with teaching tasks. Before, I was a tenure-track teacher, and I would sometimes use it to help update worksheets or generate some questions. Now that I substitute teach, when I get a lesson from a teacher who gives me the materials before the time, I use it to help me come up with opening questions/response journals or to help me figure out some creative things to do with students when there's extra time.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like your AI usage has evolved as your teaching role has changed. 

When you're working on those opening questions or creative activities for extra time, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically interact with the AI to develop those materials?

User: Let's say I'm in a Social Studies room, and I see that the materials the teacher left me are running out, so there's going to be like ten minutes of unstructured time, I use AI to come up with some related questions to keep the lesson going. For example, one time we were talking about muckrakers, and the lesson wasn't going to be long enough, so I had it make up a quick, fun assignment about things worth "muckraking." Or let's say I'm in an English room, and I know the class because I've subbed in the room before, and I know these kids need an immediate task or else they'll be chatty and maybe naughty, then I use AI to help me figure out an opening. For example, I might say, "What's a thought-provoking question related to the first half of The Pearl?" Am I supposed to tell you what AI I usually use, or should I just keep it vague?

AI: You can share whatever details feel natural to you - there's no need to keep anything vague unless you prefer to.

I'm curious about those moments when you realize you need to fill extra time or create an opening activity. How quickly can you usually get what you need from the AI? Does the back-and-forth process work well for those on-the-spot situations?

User: I usually use Gemini, since it's an app right on my phone, and it goes really fast. Sometimes what I type in immediately has a fill-in assignment idea that I can use, and sometimes I just need to hone it down a little bit. Regardless, it never takes more than a couple of minutes.

AI: That speed seems really crucial for your substitute teaching context. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain teaching tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones you do use AI for?

User: Well, back when I was a full-time, tenured teacher, I never wanted to use AI to create initial worksheets or assignments, since it often got some pretty important information wrong, especially if we were working with Shakespeare, so I would just use it to help me change some wording to make something simpler or to help me come up with alternative questions on an assignment that were differentiated to a particular learning issue. Now that I'm substitute teaching, a lot of the materials are just presented to me, so I don't go through revision processes so much. I guess AI could maybe help me compile information about classes or students, but that seems like a lot of work for a class I might only be in once or twice. It might make sense for me to start using AI to build profiles for classrooms that teachers request me in, since I know I'll be there more than once, but I only sub 1 or 2 times a week right now. I guess the more long-term compilation of data is just something I more naturally do by myself, since it involves a lot of subjective judgement.

AI: That distinction you're drawing is really insightful - it sounds like accuracy concerns and the need for subjective judgment play a big role in what you keep for yourself.

When you do use AI for those quick activities or question generation, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine ideas, or do you tend to give it a task and use what it produces fairly directly?

User: It depends on the situation, but a lot of time, I'm using what it produces right away. For example, I recently asked, "What's a follow-up through-provoking question to ask about colors related to The Giver?" and I used the first question it gave me: "Is a person's happiness diminished by the lack of something they don't even know exists?" Sometimes, though, I need to refine it a little bit. For example, when I asked the question about muckraking, I refined it by asking for less controversial ideas, since I didn't think I should talk about the Student Loan Industry or the other ideas they gave me. Most of the time, very little refinement happens.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - being able to use something immediately when you're in front of a class is really valuable.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has the shift from being a tenured teacher to substitute teaching changed how openly you discuss or use these tools?

User: AI is more and more part of schools, and sometime you can even tell when an administrator is using AI to generate emails or come up with other staff communication. We used to never, ever use AI, but it's definitely becoming more common. As for the shift from tenured teacher to substitute teacher, I don't think it's changed how openly I discuss or use these tools. I used to talk about them in my teaching team, and now I chat about them in the lunch room or with my teacher friends who are still in the classroom full-time.

AI: It sounds like there's been a real cultural shift around AI acceptance in schools overall.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Any time AI gives me a quick way to fill time when I'm subbing, I feel very satisfied!! It's stressful to be in front of a class with activities and work running out, stressing out about what behavior problems might pop up if the time isn't filled with something productive. The muckraking quick assignment was fun, and students talked about microplastics being everywhere, and also about how much of our recyclables are actually recycled. I felt like students were engaging in a really meaningful way. In terms of feeling frustrated, that hasn't happened as a sub, but it sometimes happened when I was teaching full-time. For example, I would sometimes ask it to just pull out what characters of a particular act in a Shakespeare play have speaking parts, and it would mess this up all the time. I wanted to use it to quickly help me make a list that would take time to do by myself, but then it would just end up taking the same about of time, maybe more, since I'd have to check the list and make edits.

AI: That satisfaction you describe - having that reliable backup when you're managing a classroom - really comes through clearly. And it's interesting how the accuracy issues that frustrated you as a full-time teacher aren't really a factor in your current substitute role.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not totally sure what you mean by "How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over?" Can you clarify?

AI: Sure! I mean - are there teaching skills or abilities that you worry might get rusty if you rely on AI too much? For instance, coming up with creative activities on the spot, or generating discussion questions without help. Do you ever think about whether you should practice doing these things yourself to keep those skills sharp?

User: Oh, no. I have to practice these all of the time, and so do my teacher friends. Part of being a teacher is always thinking on your toes, and there are plenty of times when there's not time to consult AI; you just have to on-the-spot come up with questions or extension activities. I'm not at all worried about skills getting rusty. In fact, I took years off raising my daughter, and it was not at all hard to come back and slip right back into using these skills.

AI: That's a great point - teaching really does require so much real-time thinking and adaptation that those core skills stay active.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you continue substitute teaching, or if you were to return to full-time teaching?

User: Hmm. Unless I take a long-term sub position, then my relationship won't evolve. If I were to take a long-term sub position, then it might. I might rely on it more to help me plan lessons when there's not much information left by the teacher. Sometimes with long-term sub positions, you are just given an overview of what to do, and I imagine AI could really help with planning specific lessons. Were I to return to full-time teaching, then I can imagine it being really helpful with creating differentiated assignments, since there are more and more students with 504s, IEPs, and language barriers.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the speed and convenience work so well for the immediate needs of substitute teaching, while the accuracy concerns make you more selective about when to use it.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I don't think so. You asked me interesting questions, and I think we covered everything.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into the unique demands of substitute teaching - from those quick classroom management moments to the differences between short-term and long-term teaching needs - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
