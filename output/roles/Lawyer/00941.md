Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, sounds great to me!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: im an attorney, so i use ai in several different ways. one common task i use it for is proofreading documents i've drafted. i frequently ask an llm to review my writing for grammar errors and for phrasing suggestions. sometimes i will even have an ai completely draft a section of a document from an outline or set of instructions. i also use llms to perform legal research for me. i will ask for it to find certain cases or provide a general overview of a certain subject

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI across different stages of your work - from research to drafting to polishing.

When you mentioned having AI completely draft sections from your outlines, I'm curious about that process. Can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How detailed are the instructions you give, and what happens next?

User: well my typical workflow for drafting a brief or a motion is to research the specific legal issue and take a high level view of the topic. usually as i research i get an idea of how the document will be structured, and i start to make a rough outline. i order the arguments and conclusions i need to make, then i place cases and other legal authorities underneath those arguments, creating a hierarchy of arguments and support. then sometimes i will attempt to have an ai draft from that outline. but usually it requires further prompting to refine various sections

AI: That iterative refinement process sounds really interesting. When you say it usually requires further prompting to refine sections, what typically needs adjusting? 

Are you finding yourself going back and forth with the AI to get it right, or is it more like you take what it gives you and then rework it yourself?

User: my outlines typically dont have an extensive discussion/explanation of my thought process, it is typically focused on main ideas. so a lot of times it seems that an ai will not make the same connections between ideas and supporting authorities. for instance, an ai might not connect a significant fact in a case to an argument noted in the outline. or it might fail to distinguish two cases on a nuanced point. that is the sort of thing that would require another prompt to fix. but many times the ai provides a rough first draft that then reveals weak points in the analysis, or it phrases things in a way that i can determine are not the most persuasive/compelling, and then i will rewrite on my own complete. sometimes it takes seeing an imperfect version of an argument to realize the right way to say something

AI: That's a fascinating insight - using the AI's imperfect draft as a way to clarify your own thinking. It sounds like sometimes the AI's version helps you see what you actually want to say by showing you what you don't want to say.

I'm curious about those moments when the AI misses nuanced connections or distinctions between cases. When that happens, how do you decide whether to try explaining that nuance to the AI versus just handling that part yourself?

User: sometimes i enjoy seeing if the ai will reach the same conclusion if i give it a hint. so i might just say "what do you think about _? does that change your analysis?" but if im short on time i will typically just write something myself

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like there's almost a puzzle-solving element to it when you have the time. 

Shifting gears a bit, I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your legal work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: i really enjoy writing, so sometimes i will just decide to write something myself, especially if i have had good ideas or im particularly interested or excited in the topic. there are also many things that i would love to use ai for but i cant due to confidentiality or ethical concerns. so sometimes i think ai could be really helpful, but my hands are tied

AI: That's really important context - the ethical and confidentiality constraints must create some interesting tensions. 

I'm curious about that first point you made about writing when you're excited about a topic. Can you tell me more about what makes you choose to write something yourself in those moments? What's different about that experience for you?

User: sometimes the relevant authorities (cases, etc.) have failed to account for some nuance, and setting forth an argument addressing that can be challenging but satisfying. it feels like solving a puzzle when you figure out the right words to use. other times the other party will make an argument that i think is dishonest or irrational. i find that i am more motivated in those instances to prove someone wrong

AI: That puzzle-solving aspect really comes through clearly - and the satisfaction of finding just the right argument or phrasing sounds genuinely rewarding. The competitive element when countering what you see as dishonest arguments is interesting too.

When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: definitely interact throughout. as an attorney, i have ethical obligations to ensure any work i do for a client meets certain standards of quality. i simply cannot turn in a brief with legal research that i have not personally reviewed. there are many instances of attorneys being exposed for submitting briefs with citations to ai-hallucinated cases. i could lose my license for doing something like that. so i always need to confirm the work that an ai has done for me

AI: That makes complete sense - those professional responsibilities create a very clear framework for how you can interact with AI. The legal profession's experience with hallucinated cases has definitely been a cautionary tale.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are people generally open about using these tools, or is there more hesitation?

User: younger coworkers are more interested in using ai. but my boss at my last job was in her 60s and she was very pro-ai and introduced a lot of new policies and use cases for ai. i think the legal field in general sees it as an uncertainty. i would say it is not highly encouraged in my current position

AI: That generational split you mentioned is interesting, but it sounds like your former boss was an exception to that pattern. 

When you say it's "not highly encouraged" in your current position, how does that affect the way you use AI? Do you find yourself being more cautious about when and how you use it, or does it not really change your approach much?

User: yes i have to be very cautious. i tend to not be so open about using ai because i think some people, including my direct superior would be more doubtful of my work product if they knew ai was involved. but it is by no means banned or prohibited in my job.

AI: That creates an interesting dynamic where you're navigating both the technical capabilities and the workplace perceptions around AI use.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: so i was doing some research recently on a pretty difficult legal issue and i thought i had read all of the cases on the topic. but i asked ai to find cases based on a hypothetical fact pattern and it turned up an obscure state case that i had not seen before. it ended up being highly relevant to my research. it confirmed for me that ai can be a powerful tool. but i have also had encounters in which the ai simply generated fictional cases. as soon as i pointed it out, the ai admitted that the cases were fictionalized. that was pretty frustrating and i actually stopped using ai for a bit after that

AI: What a perfect illustration of both the promise and the pitfalls! Finding that obscure but highly relevant case must have felt like striking gold, especially after thinking you'd been thorough.

That experience with the fictional cases leading you to stop using AI for a while - what eventually brought you back to using it again? Was there something specific that shifted your approach or rebuilt your confidence?

User: i think ai is always advancing so i didnt want to throw it all away just for one bad experience. if i had instead asked an entry level associate to do the research, it's possible they could do a bad job too! i just took it as a reminder that ai is by no means perfect. i still see immense potential in the technology for my job so i want to make sure i am up to date with it

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - treating AI like any other tool or colleague that needs verification. The comparison to an entry-level associate is particularly apt.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as the technology continues advancing?

User: certainly. i think there are certain parts of my job that may simply become completely automated. but there are other parts, especially dealing with clients, that may never be done away with. i think it is important to realize that certain skills may become less significant over time. but i wouldnt stop training certain skills, like legal research or writing, entirely

AI: That's a thoughtful approach to skill development in an evolving landscape. The distinction between client-facing work and other tasks makes a lot of sense.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally?

User: i think i will continue to learn the technology's strengths and weaknesses and can hopefully learn what types of tasks are best to delegate to ai, and which are best to do myself. that would ideally make me more efficient while still ensuring high quality work product

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to think about the evolution - developing that intuition about when to use which approach.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experience with AI in legal work. I particularly appreciated how you described that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining your professional responsibilities and the puzzle-solving satisfaction you get from certain writing tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no that's all, thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating AI use in the legal profession - from the ethical constraints to workplace dynamics to that balance between efficiency and quality - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
