Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically I use AI to help me get ideas about how to update recurring event campaigns from year year with fresh language and new facts (i work for a university and am in charge of creating all sorts of recruitment content. I sometimes use it to communicate ideas to designers for print pieces or to help me refine headlines. I also sometimes use it to create summaries of feedback notes i'm given but haven't taken, which helps becuase the notes are often chaotic.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is helping you across several different aspects of your recruitment work. 

When you're refreshing those recurring campaigns with new language and facts, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: Let's say I want to update an email for one of our recurring annual events. I'll copy paste some of the olds emails into the prompt field, provide new date/time information or any event details that may have changed, and ask it to rewrite it using various prompts such as "make it feel more welcoming" or "make it friendlier" etc, and try variations of this a couple of times to see if anything inspires me. Currently, I almost alwasy rewrite most of what it does, but it helps me see it from a different angle.

AI: That's a fascinating approach - using AI more as a creative springboard than a final solution. You mentioned that you almost always rewrite most of what it produces but that it helps you see things from a different angle.

What is it about seeing it from that different angle that's valuable to you in your work?

User: since i do the same thing over and over, somtimes the words lose meaning if i'm stressed or rushed, and seeing them rewritten reminds me of the value propositions i'm 'trying to make, or it may highlight a benefit i hadn't thought of

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like AI helps you step back and see the forest for the trees when you're deep in routine work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned always rewriting what it produces. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself entirely, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I always answer emails personally even though i'm sure Ai could do it because I have studies writing for many years and I want to ensure my voice is maintained so that i can keep an authentic relationship with people i mostly communicate with over email.

AI: That's really thoughtful - maintaining that authentic voice in your relationships. It sounds like there's something important to you about preserving that personal connection.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: i almost always iterate things at least a few times with both writing and visual suggestions. occaistionally something it does in a response gets me off topic and i start having it work on unrelated things just because i enjoy chasing whatever feels fun in the moment when i have multiple things due

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like sometimes the AI sparks your curiosity and you follow those tangents, especially when you're juggling multiple deadlines.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: a couple of years ago we had a work retreat where we all were assigned to come up with things that AI could do for us that we may not have thought of before, which sort of got us all using Ai a little bit more. The other day, one of the people on my team had called in sick and wasn't able to sign another team member's birthday card, so my boss had AI come up with something to write for her kind of as a joke, and sometimes i use it to make silly pictures of our school's mascots. It's not something we had ever messed with before. However, we are all a little careful of some tools since one of our project managers had been using an AI assistant on our teams that violated our institutions data security rules

AI: That data security incident sounds like it created some awareness around tool selection. It's interesting how your workplace seems to have this mix of playful experimentation - like the mascot pictures and birthday card - alongside that caution.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: sometimes i use the same chatbot for both personal things at home and work related things, and it gets really stuck into personalization across  conversations, like integrating tone, languages, and ideas from creative projects i have it look at for feedback into marketing emails where it doens't make sense to include it. But other times i've had it read a mess of notes that my brain didn't feel like processing and it distilled it down to some conise ideas i was able to use to ensure i applied all the feedback into the next proof of my project.

AI: That's a great example of both sides of the experience. The cross-contamination between personal and work contexts sounds really frustrating when it pulls in irrelevant tone or ideas.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: one the one hand my few hundred hours of experience with using ai has shown me it is not as good as me yet in many respects at writing, but on the other hand, browsing the internet and seeing so much clearly Ai generated content has shown me that that might not matter to a lot of people who used to pay money to human content creators. I consider this often but i work in a state job that feels slightly more secure than other content creation/marketing jobs, so i'm taking my time considering what i could even do if jobs like mine are vanishing

AI: That tension you're describing - between recognizing AI's current limitations but also seeing how it's already changing the market for content - sounds like something you're really grappling with thoughtfully.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: i suspect it might at some poimti start using it more to read things like email threads, white papers, market research power points, etc and summarizing it to help me ascertain whether or not i need to look more closely. i will also likely continue using it for ideation and suggestions for writing.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you see familiar content from a different angle when you're stuck in routine, and your honest reflection about the tension between AI's current limitations and its market impact.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: not that i can think og

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative springboard, the importance of maintaining your authentic voice in relationships, and how workplace culture shapes AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your thoughtful approach to integrating these tools into your work while being mindful of both their potential and their limitations.

User: no problem!

AI: Thank you so much! Have a great rest of your day.
