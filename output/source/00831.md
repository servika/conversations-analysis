Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, i'm ready to begin.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So, as a Product Owner, my main responsibilities are to collect requirements, organize those requirements, meet with stakeholders, validate their needs to ensure that they fit our overall product roadmap, conduct research and analyze data in order to make decisions, and prioritize our product backlog using all of the qualitative and quantitative data that I collect through my meetings with stakeholders and collaborators. 

In my typical workday, I use AI with the main goal of speeding up some of my tasks. For example, i'm unfortunately not the best at Excel; while it's a skill that I still need to refine, I often find myself using AI to quickly generate formulas for me so that I can work through data and conduct analysis faster. I also use it to generate ideas to get me started on some things, like finding solutions and initiative ideas for user and stakeholder needs that don't necessarily have a clear or straightforward way to solve them. Another way I use AI is to sometimes help me think through some situations. For example, let's say that we have a bug affecting some users that cannot log in their account. When thinking about prioritizing this, i'll sometimes use AI to help me organize my thoughts, the kinds of questions that I might have to ask when meeting with the QA & UAT teams, or help me work through a RICE framework for quick impact assessment. I also will use it for quick miscellaneous questions.

AI: That's a really comprehensive overview - it sounds like you've found some strategic ways to integrate AI into different aspects of your role.

When you mentioned using AI to generate Excel formulas and help with data analysis, tell me more about that. How does that typically work for you - do you describe what you're trying to accomplish and then get the formula back, or is there more back-and-forth involved?

User: Most times, I give a simple explanation of what I am trying to do and ask for the formula as the output. For example "Can you come up with a formula for Excel that can apply conditionnal formatting for all of Column A if the value of cell "B4" is "Canada"?".

To be honest, most times it doesn't work on the first try and it takes some (sometimes a lot) of back-and-forth to get the exact formula that I need. I'll try the formula in Excel, see that it doesn't work, and copy-paste the error to the AI, expecting a revised, working formula. It's irritating sometimes, but still faster than reading up on how each formula works, since a lot of my usage of it is very situational.

AI: That back-and-forth process you described is really interesting. You mentioned it can be irritating sometimes when the formulas don't work on the first try, but you still find it faster than learning the formulas yourself.

When you're in those moments where you're going back and forth with error messages, what keeps you pushing through that process rather than just switching to figuring it out on your own?

User: Like I mentioned, it's mostly the fact that I know that it's still faster than having to find the resources online to make the formula work correctly. Searching for the answers online for this specific kind of need (excel formulas) is time consuming and sometimes can be confusing. I have a very full schedule and I don't want to get distracted by having tons of tabs open in my browser just to find the right formula.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping focused with your packed schedule is clearly important.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned several different ways you use it - from Excel formulas to brainstorming solutions to organizing your thoughts around prioritization. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Hmmm, the first one that i'm thinking about is prioritization. It's the core part of my work, and it requires a lot of contextual knowledges, but also requires me to negociate a lot with different stakeholders in order to get it right. 

For example, let's say we're trying to implement a new version of a search results page for my product. I know that my team sees the project as a very high value initiative, but some other teams who don't have the visibility that my team does might not agree with the fact that we are working on this project instead of another that they see as more valuable. I sometime need to negociate -- by demonstrating to those teams that value, or by agreeing to look into some other issues that the other team finds valuable (and fits in our product vision as well!) so that they are reassured that their needs will be met. 

This kind of human-to-human, contextual work is first of all one of the main reasons why I love the work that I am doing, but also, I don't feel like using AI would really help me be better at doing this. The amount of context it would need would be absolutely huge, and it would require for the model helping me to basically have access to every email, meeting notes, Teams messages, document, azure ticket, etc. in order for it to help me. Maybe in the future it could help me, maybe with organizing insights, notes, reminders about certain situations, but it would really struggle with understanding people's feelings and the "political landscape" of my workplace, which are essential to succeed in the work that i'm doing.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction you're drawing - the deeply contextual, relationship-based aspects of your role versus the more discrete, technical tasks. The political landscape element you mentioned is particularly compelling.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? For instance, with those Excel formulas or when you're brainstorming solution ideas - are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend more to collaborate with it. To be honest, I don't feel comfortable with letting AI do entire tasks for me. It's more of a quality issue for me; what if I ask it to send an email for me, for example, and that email is completely wrong? I don't want my name to be associated with errors, and as we all know, no matter how good the models are getting, they are still prone to errors, and hallucinations. I feel like if an AI that i'm using makes a mistake in my name, it would be more shameful than if I made the error myself.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective about ownership and accountability. The concern about your name being associated with AI errors versus your own mistakes is something I hadn't considered in quite that way.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that the environment you're in shapes how comfortable you feel using these tools?

User: As for my colleagues, more or less. I tend to make my own decisions about this kind of stuff. If someone teaches me about a cool way to use AI and explain to me how it helped in their work, I might consider it, but i'll always "vet it" by thinking about how it might apply to my case first. 

As for the workplace culture, the company where i'm currently working is in a wierd place right now. We have company-approved AI models that we can use, but I feel like they don't necessarily perform that well compared to the ones I use for my personal project, and also I still have a limit of prompts per conversation where I have to start a new chat. With that said, the company as a whole has implemented a multitude of AI-enabled initiatives (some of which I have participated in!) that really helped with boosting productivity, but also had a controversial side effect where we sadly had to say goodbye to 100+ colleagues who were laid off because of these new initiatives, where productivity was so good that they were no longer needed. So the culture as a whole is at the same time embracing AI, while being very wary of the future impacts that it could have.

AI: That's a really complex dynamic you've described - simultaneously embracing AI for productivity gains while witnessing the very real human cost of those efficiencies. That would create such a conflicted atmosphere around AI use.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Honestly, my best example is really with the Excel formulas -- there was one time where it COULD NOT get it right, and I really felt like I was wasting my time and getting gaslit by the model. It was for a minor formatting request, and I was getting to a point where I already wasted so much time to make it work that I just didn't want to not get the result I wanted at the end. But in the end, I closed Excel, and moved on to something else, haha.

AI: That's such a relatable experience - that feeling of being "gaslit by the model" is a vivid way to put it! The sunk cost element you described is interesting too, where you'd already invested so much time that you didn't want to give up, even when it might have been more efficient to do so.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Hmmm, yes and no. My plan is to get to a place where i'm safe (or safeR) than right now as it pertains to AI and my role. I feel like having a higher ranking position could help with that. Also, given the complicated relationship between my workplace and AI, I feel like I couldn't be replaced in a long time...but that's considering that I stay at that same place, you know? 

When I think about a situation where I leave my current job and need to search for another one, i'll admit that i'm a little scared about feeling like i'm not using AI "enough" or in smart enough ways compared to people who currently work in a culture where AI is more broadly embraced and where people are better enabled to use it. 

That said, I often think "if we have AI doing everything...then what? What do we do all day?". I like my work, I like doing what I do, and would feel weird if I wouldn't be able to do it anymore.

AI: That tension you're describing is really striking - wanting to stay competitive while also genuinely enjoying the work you do. The fear of not using AI "enough" compared to others in different workplace cultures is something I imagine many people are grappling with right now.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in any particular direction?

User: I would like to see it evolve, but I feel like i'm not the right person at my work to really make these changes happen. At least not for now. My main hope would be to see a way that we can use AI to really, truly benefit humans at work. Help make it fun, more enriched, worthwhile.

AI: That's a beautiful vision - using AI to make work more enriching and worthwhile for humans rather than just more efficient.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that tension between embracing AI for productivity while being cautious about its broader workplace impacts, and your clear distinction between the tasks you're comfortable delegating versus those that require your human judgment and relationship skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's it for me!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the complexities of AI adoption in the workplace - from the practical frustrations with Excel formulas to the broader cultural tensions around productivity and job security - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and challenges you've experienced. Have a great rest of your day!
