Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: There are a few ways that I use AI in my workday. The first is that I use it to brainstorm ideas for how to write or rewrite certain things like procedures. The second is that I use it to help generate presentations. Lastly I use it to help summarize ideas and generate outlines for future projects

AI: That's a great range of uses. I'd love to hear more specifics about how these work in practice. 

When you're brainstorming ideas for writing or rewriting procedures, what does that process actually look like between you and the AI?

User: Typically it will start with me providing a basic summary of the procedure I am trying to write and it will ask the AI to help get me started based on the details I have provided. For rewrites I will ask the AI to help summarize or say things differently

AI: That gives me a good sense of how you get started. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are certain tasks where the details are proprietary to the company I work for and so I am hesitant to use AI for assistance. I cannot risk the details becoming public knowledge or being used by competitors so I need to work on those items myself.

AI: That makes complete sense from a confidentiality standpoint. 

Beyond those proprietary concerns, are there other types of work tasks where you choose to handle things yourself even when AI could potentially help? What draws you to keep certain work for yourself?

User: I still tend to handle data analysis myself but that is largely due to my uncertainty on how to ask the AI to help. I feel I do not know how to ask the AI to help when it comes to reviewing data sets and spreadsheets. I don't know what prompts to use

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like it's more about not knowing how to effectively engage with AI for data analysis rather than preferring to do it yourself. 

When you do use AI for the tasks you mentioned earlier - like brainstorming procedures or generating presentations - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and let it handle things independently?

User: I still find myself going back and forth with brainstorming as I often am still trying to figure out what it is I really want to say or include. I wish I could be better at creating strong prompts from the beginning

AI: It sounds like that back-and-forth process is actually serving a purpose for you - helping you clarify your own thinking as you go. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk openly about using these tools, or is it something you navigate more privately?

User: In the beginning no one talked about using any form of AI and I felt like I was the only one using it. So I did not talk openly about it and almost felt guilty for using it. But recently my company has begun openly discussing tools that can be used and several team members have begun experimenting with the tools available. They are also finally sharing their experiences and sharing what has worked well for them

AI: That's a fascinating shift from feeling like you had to keep it secret to now having open discussions. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was tasked with reviewing current procedures around a specific process and to identify gaps and/or eliminate unnecessary steps. We have several procedures and it was becoming overwhelming trying to keep track of it all and to really make sense of what needed to be reviewed, documented and changed. I decided to use AI to help me get organized and to speed up the review process. It was amazing how quickly I could load procedures and simply ask the AI to look for things that were repetitive and to ask the AI to help synthesize what each document referenced. It took a daunting task and made it manageable and helped me complete the project ahead of schedule. I was extremely pleased with the outcome and excited to think of other ways AI could help

AI: That sounds like a really powerful experience - turning something overwhelming into something manageable and even finishing early. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I think about this often. To some degree it can be exciting to let AI take over mundane tasks that free up time to work on larger projects. But on the other hand it is very concerning to think that there are tasks where I might not be needed for in the future and if that will negatively impact my job or if they would need to have my job in the future

AI: That tension between excitement and concern sounds very real. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally?

User: My job largely requires a real person to navigate projects that need to have testing and verification. But there is an enormous amount of administrative work and data analysis that is time consuming and requires a tremendous amount of  accuracy. I can envision a partnership with AI where I utilize it for the administrative functions of my job. The AI would like have a better accuracy rate that a human and could review large data sets in just seconds versus hours. This would help us to provide faster turn around on critical data needed for business decisions while also freeing up time for us to provide more support and guidance to team members which we do not have enough time for now

AI: That vision of partnership sounds really thoughtful - using AI's strengths in accuracy and speed for administrative work while freeing you up for the human elements like guidance and support.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the workplace culture shifted from secrecy to open discussion, and that powerful example of how AI helped you tackle that overwhelming procedure review project.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I do not have anything else. Thank you

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that evolution from feeling guilty about using AI to now having collaborative discussions at work, and your vision of AI as a partnership tool rather than a replacement, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
