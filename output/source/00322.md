Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's start!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a freelancer and entrepreneur and have multiple projects and businesses I use various AI tools for. For my captioning and transcription work, I use tools like Otter.ai for voice to text transcriptions. For my mechanic work, I'll use Google Gemini in Assistant mode and Lens for diagnostics, information, and looking up parts and diagrams. For my clothing resale business, I use Google Lens for looking up products and finding pricing, and some my selling platforms like eBay offer AI tools for writing product descriptions.

AI: That's fascinating - you're using AI across such a diverse range of work areas. It sounds like you've found very specific tools that fit each business context.

Tell me more about how you use Google Gemini and Lens for your mechanic work. What does that interaction typically look like when you're doing diagnostics?

User: I'll take a picture of the part and use Google Lens to find out what it is. I'll use Gemini to help find service manuals and part numbers. There was one particular instance where I was not able to find a service manual for a generator, but in our conversation , Gemini was able to find one and provide me the link.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you solve a specific problem you couldn't handle on your own. It sounds like Gemini was able to access resources you hadn't been able to locate yourself.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Usually the data entry parts for the clothing resale business, like filling in pricing information and selecting product categories. AI or auto fill doesn't always get those parts right, so I like keeping control of that part

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you want to maintain control over the parts that directly impact your pricing and categorization accuracy.

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: More collaboration. When using it to make product descriptions, there are often tweak that I want to do to keep the language more me. In the mechanic works, there's usually a back and forth conversation when doing diagnostics. For the transcription work, there's usually some editing to the text that needs to happen before it can be usable for the clients l.

AI: So it sounds like you rarely just hand something off completely - there's almost always that human touch needed at the end. The back-and-forth diagnostic conversations with AI for mechanic work is particularly interesting.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since you're freelancing, how do your clients or the communities you work in view AI use?

User: I work for myself, so I don't really have colleague influence. Asy selling platforms roll out AI based tools, I'm invited to use them, so I'll at least give them a try and see if they help boost production in any way. AI use always has such mixed views, and the negative nancies always scream the loudest. I just do what works for me to boost my bottom line.

AI: That's a refreshingly practical approach - focusing on what actually improves your business rather than getting caught up in the debates. It sounds like you're willing to experiment when platforms offer new AI features.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My first interactions with using AI in the transcription work, back like over 10 years ago, were really frustrating. The voice to text AIs weren't very good at anything other than pristine clear audio, which made a lot of the files I worked with challenging and require lots of extra editing for mishears. They also weren't good at proper punctuation, and a whole interview would come out as one long sentence. It's gotten better, but all that editing in the earlier days was really frustrating.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - essentially creating more work instead of saving time. It's interesting that you stuck with it through those early, clunky years.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. I'm human, and more adaptable. I've never been one to settle into a particular career, so if AI took over my job, I'd shift and find something else to do. Robots can't do everything, there will always be a place for humans. At least in my lifetime.

AI: That's a confident and adaptable mindset - viewing change as just part of the natural evolution of work rather than something to fear.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'm open to trying the new tools that come out. I know they're not always great at first, so I'm also open to trying them again later on down the road as they smooth out the bugs.

AI: That willingness to give tools a second chance after they improve is really insightful - especially given your experience with transcription AI getting better over the years.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your practical, results-focused approach and how you've witnessed the evolution of these tools over more than a decade.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, your questions covered some really interesting points. Thanks for the chat!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your perspective as someone who's been working with AI tools for over a decade across multiple businesses was incredibly valuable. Your insights about the evolution from those early frustrating transcription tools to today's more collaborative approach will be really helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
