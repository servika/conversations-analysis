Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I'm eager to read your questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use AI for drafting work emails and memos. It streamlines my workday tremendously. I also use AI to generate reports, which gives me a great basis that I can tailor as needed. Furthermore, I use AI to familiarize myself with engineering concepts that are outside of my scope of ability, which then helps me to better communicate with stakeholders.

AI: That's really helpful context. You mentioned using AI to familiarize yourself with engineering concepts outside your scope - can you tell me more about that? What does that process typically look like for you?

User: For example, if there is a set principle or formula that I do not have functional knowledge of, I will consult with AI to explain it in a way that makes sense. This allows me to present ideas to stakeholders without feeling lost or unsure.

AI: That makes a lot of sense. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: When communicating with my direct team, I prefer to draft emails and memos myself. We are typically on a more casual level, so I don't have to worry as much about structure. However, if I am corresponding with a key stakeholder, I like to use AI to check my grammar and make suggestions regarding the inclusion of certain information and/or tone.

AI: That's an interesting distinction between casual team communication and stakeholder correspondence. When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I like to collaborate with AI throughout the tasks. As a project manager, it is crucial that I maintain a high level of awareness and scrutiny throughout each task/project to ensure that all objectives are met. Therefore, collaboration is the responsible course of action.

AI: That makes perfect sense from a project management perspective. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues enjoy AI's inclusion in the workplace. They understand that it is a tool to help us leverage our time.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have had a few times where I have been frustrated at inconsistencies with figures, particularly when generating reports. However, I understand that it is my responsibility to double-check the AI model's work.

AI: Tell me more about those inconsistencies with figures. What kind of issues did you encounter, and how did you handle them?

User: I experienced inconsistencies with timeframes, in particular, some models are not the best at translating 'from, to' into more tangible figures. Honestly, this is an easy fix. It can just be cumbersome at times.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Ultimately, it is my responsibility to hone my skills and showcase my value as an employee. AI is capable of many things, but in the event of a breach or technical error, it cannot actually take over.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I expect that there will be more automation as the AI models gain more skills and abilities. I believe there will be far more tasks that can be delegated to the models, allowing employees to focus on other areas.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining responsibility and oversight as a project manager, even while leveraging AI as a collaborative tool.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. It's been really valuable to hear how you balance collaboration with AI while maintaining the oversight and responsibility that's so crucial in project management.

Have a great rest of your day!
