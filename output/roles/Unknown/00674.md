Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Ok. I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical workday I don't use AI at all (except for occasionally reading the AI summaries on web searches (I prefer actual search results though, and don't trust the summaries automatically). My AI use for work purposes is *very* occasional! I have used it for brainstorming wording/titles/ copywriting type stuff mostly.

AI: That's really interesting that your AI use is so occasional, especially for someone participating in this kind of research. 

When you do turn to AI for that brainstorming and copywriting work, what prompts you to make that decision? What's happening in those moments that makes you think "this might be a good time to try AI"?

User: Brainstorming is all about throwing a bunch of ideas at the wall and there's no need to be accurate/correct. I'm not getting the AI to give me anything that's meant to be a  final product. Just using it to get fragments I can massage into something really good, or to help get my brain running in the right direction with an idea.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI as a creative springboard rather than for finished work. 

Tell me more about that process of massaging those AI fragments into something really good. What does that look like for you? How do you typically take what the AI gives you and transform it into your final product?

User: I'll usually get the AI to give me multiple options for a short piece of writing. From those options I can see word choices or turns of phrase I particularly like, and take those to use in whatever first draft I may have written before consulting the AI.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - treating the AI output like a palette of options to draw from. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you don't use it much day-to-day. Are there certain tasks where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help? What makes those tasks different from the brainstorming work you do use it for?

User: I'm not much of a delegator in general to be honest. I prefer to do things myself rather that reviewing and fixing someone else's work (which I 'd have to do with AI's work as well). The more satisfying part of the work is the creation, not the editing/fixing, and I can get into a more focused and 'flow'-like state doing the work myself. I could see my self asking AI for editing suggestions, but I wouldn't automatically accept them all or take on all its recommended changes.

AI: That's a really insightful point about preferring the creation process over editing and fixing. It sounds like there's something about that direct engagement with the work that's important to you.

When you do use AI for those brainstorming sessions, how does that interaction typically unfold? Are you going back and forth with it, building ideas together, or do you tend to ask for what you need and then take it from there on your own?

User: I try to be very specific about all of the considerations of what I need in my initial prompt. But if nothing quite hits the mark, or nothing sparks me into the right direction to run off on my own, I will sometimes iterate by letting it know which ideas I liked and why, and ask for more ideas along those lines to get closer to the mark before I finish polishing it independenetly.

AI: That iterative refinement process sounds really deliberate - getting more precise about what resonates with you. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that the environment around you shapes your approach to these tools at all?

User: My colleagues don't really use AI in their work I don't think. I know I have one colleague who has played around with it for personal use, but in general as librarians, we're all pretty circumspect about it, and very aware of the drawbacks of using a tool that can't be trusted to accurately cite its sources etc.

AI: That makes a lot of sense given your profession - accuracy and proper sourcing are fundamental to library work. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied: I have used AI to help me come up with catchy titles and copywriting for library programs. I am not always great at being concise, so I can find it helpful for that!

AI: That's great - it sounds like AI really complements your skills there, helping with that conciseness challenge. 

Tell me more about that experience. When you got those catchy, concise options from the AI, what made it feel particularly satisfying? Was it the result itself, or something about the process?

User: I just like having a good answer to a problem, regardless of the source!

AI: That's refreshingly practical! 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given your preference for doing the creative work yourself?

User: I am genuinely not concerned about AI taking over my work! So much of my work is people-facing, and the parts that aren't simply require a level of real-world judgment I trust the executive board to know better than to hand over to algorithms.

AI: That confidence in the irreplaceable nature of your work is really interesting, especially coming from someone who's clearly thoughtful about AI's capabilities and limitations.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll continue with this very occasional, targeted use, or do you see it changing in some way?

User: It's possible it could change! I wouldn't be mad about an AI personal assistant for keeping a to-do list with deadlines for me.

AI: That's an interesting distinction - an AI assistant for administrative tasks like organizing deadlines feels different from using it for the creative or analytical work you prefer to do yourself.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on preferring the creation process over editing and how that shapes your very selective use of AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: It was interesting to me that you found it contradictory for me to not use AI in my regular work when I also do AI research work! But honestly, it's my work on this side that makes me so precisely aware of the limitations, failings, and outright dangers of using AI in a generalized way. I hyper-focus on the things I know that I can properly judge the AI's responses on (and that I'm reasonably certain they can perform well on) and won't be led astray!

AI: That's such a valuable insight - your research background actually makes you more discerning, not less, about when and how to use AI. It's fascinating how deep knowledge of the technology leads to more precise, cautious application rather than broader adoption.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your perspective as someone who understands AI's capabilities deeply but uses it very selectively has been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. This kind of nuanced, thoughtful approach is exactly what we're hoping to learn about.
