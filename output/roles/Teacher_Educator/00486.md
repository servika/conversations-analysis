Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

Just so you know, anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No I do not

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I am a 6th grade ELA teacher so I have used AI in a various ways.  I have used it to come up with writing prompts, to write letters to families (as a starting point), to come up with examples, to give examples of how to simplify something.  I have used it to come up with standards based questions when uploading a text.  Lots of different ways!

AI: That's a really diverse range of uses! It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into different aspects of your teaching.

When you mention using it as "a starting point" for letters to families, tell me more about that process. How do you typically work with the AI output once you get it?

User: So I use it as a starting point and then make adjustments with AI or without to make sure that it invokes the correct tone and information that I want to send out

AI: That's interesting - so you'll sometimes go back and forth with the AI to refine the tone and content. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle the development of my powerpoint slide lessons on my own.  When I've tried to use AI for the development it has fallen short of my expectations

AI: That's really insightful. When you say it's fallen short of your expectations with PowerPoint development, what specifically wasn't working for you? What was missing or not quite right about what the AI produced?

User: It did not have enough meaningful graphics and the information felt flat and not something that could be used with my 6th grade students with putting a lot more leg work

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like the AI wasn't capturing the engagement level and visual appeal that 6th graders need, and would have required significant rework on your part.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: More collaboration.  Everything I use it with I would expect to have some tweaks with

AI: That collaborative approach seems to be a consistent theme in how you work with AI. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been any particular encouragement, hesitation, or guidance from your school or fellow teachers?

User: My team have used AI along with me to develop learning goals to put on our common board and have supported the use of AI to develop standards based questions

AI: It sounds like you have a supportive team environment for AI use. That's great that you're working together on things like learning goals.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have used AI to help with grading essays.  It was satisfying to see how closely aligned the AIs grade was with my analysis of the written essay.  In addition, the AI was able to offer detailed feedback that could be used when conferencing with the student.  That made my job much easier.

AI: That's a really compelling example - it sounds like the AI not only validated your own assessment but also provided you with concrete tools for student conferences. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider it as I have heard reports of schools that actively use AI for instruction.  To me, it is simply a tool and one on one with a student and with a person will always win out in making real gains.  You cant beat the relationships formed with our students.  Those connections allow students to take academic risks and increase their success.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - you're highlighting something that AI fundamentally can't replicate. The relationship aspect seems central to how you view your role as an educator.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for new purposes as you continue teaching?

User: I envision using AI in lots of different ways to make my job easier and my time more efficiently

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the human relationship element in teaching can't be replaced - that one-on-one connection that helps students take academic risks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes, as a teacher my job is also to teach my students how to use AI appropriately while maintaining integrity in their learning.  That will always be a battle

AI: That's such an important point - you're not just using AI yourself, but also having to navigate teaching your students about appropriate AI use while preserving academic integrity. That adds a whole additional layer of complexity to your role that many other professions don't face.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about both the practical applications and the broader challenges of AI in education will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for participating - your perspectives as an educator were really valuable. Have a great rest of your day!
