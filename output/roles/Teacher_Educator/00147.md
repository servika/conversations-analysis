Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good. I do not have any questions.

AI: Great, let's dive in then. Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently, I am a teacher and I use AI to help with lesson planning and coming up with creative ways to engage students.  This could be center ideas, video ideas, creative ways to teach a topic, etc.

AI: That sounds like AI is playing a creative support role in your teaching. When you're developing these lesson plans or brainstorming engagement ideas, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: Usually it is very simple.  I teach STEM, so for example I am doing an upcoming lesson  where the students are creating straw rockets and launch them using a straw rocket launcher.  (This is a 6 week project). I needed some simple station ideas that would go along with the lesson standard, but would be a more independent task.  (I only have one straw launcher, so I wanted some independent stations that students could do while I am working with different groups to test their straw rockets.  I was trying to avoid students just sitting around being bored or not engaged in an activity.). I was also trying to incorporate some math measurement standards into the project because they do need to measure the length of the straws.  I wanted to practice activities to use for measurement to the nearest 1/4 of an inch.

AI: So you needed stations that would keep students productively engaged while giving you time to work with each group individually. When you brought this challenge to AI, what happened next? How did that interaction unfold?

User: The ai gave a couple suggestions of making rockets out of other materials, there was a paper airplane activity to see how folding the paper in different ways affected how far the airplane would go.  I did tell the ai that I had a stomp rocket pad that could be used too and it gave the idea to have the kids create rockets to use on that.  The ai just listed some ideas in a bulleted list.  It was pretty helpful.

AI: It sounds like AI gave you a solid starting point with those station ideas. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: So even though AI could help with giving objectives that would fit within a project or activity, my standards as a teacher are set in stone by the county.  So I usually have to set the standard that I am working on, and ask the AI to give ideas that would fit the standard. Some things that I need help with are set by my county, so even though they may be great ideas, if they don't line up with the standard, I may not be able to use them.

AI: That's a really important distinction - you need to maintain control over ensuring alignment with your county's standards. When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it the parameters upfront and let it handle the brainstorming independently?

User: Both, but ultimately I am more likely to collaborate throughout.  I will give the parameters upfront and see what it comes up with, but usually I will also think of other ideas that are related to the AI answer and then collaborate to work out the details of an activity.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth sounds like it helps you build on the AI's initial ideas. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I am not sure.  I have not really discussed this with colleagues.  But I have heard that teachers are using AI in a similar fashion.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I haven't really been frustrated yet using AI in the workplace. However, any help coming up with ideas to use with kids is beneficial and I am usually satisfied.  There is not one instance that really stands out to me.

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think AI will take over classroom teaching, so I don't really worry about that.  However, I have definitely considered how helpful AI can be for teachers.  This could be for creating station ideas like discussed above, creating slide decks or presentations to explain a topic,  writing worksheets that are specific to what you teach, or even simple tasks like creating groups and playing jeopardy games.  There are so many ways AI can help take some of the load off of teachers, because right now the teacher workload is pretty heavy.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Yes, I am getting more comfortable using it as a tool.  The more I use it for my job the easier it gets to pinpoint the right things to ask to get the results I need.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps manage the heavy workload teachers face while you maintain control over the educational standards and requirements.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.  Thanks and I glad it helps.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative brainstorming partner while maintaining control over educational standards will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today.
