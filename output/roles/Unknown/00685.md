Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I live an work at a sober living facility. I often use AI to research different clinical aspects that clients may benefit from. I use AI to research different psychiatric conditions that clients may have to gain more understanding and appreciation. I have also used AI to research different licensing issues and aspects as they come up.

AI: That sounds like really meaningful work you're doing. When you're researching these clinical aspects or psychiatric conditions for your clients, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? How do you go about gathering that information?

User: Sure, I usually get an idea about something that could be helpful, or that I wan to know more about. I then use AI to quickly compile research on the topic. For example, how EMDR may be helpful for PTSD.

AI: That's a helpful example. When you're researching something like EMDR for PTSD, what happens after AI compiles that research for you? Do you take that information and use it directly, or do you do something else with it?

User: I typically take in all the information, then try to apply it in group therapy. I will often discuss it with the different therapists I work with and get there opinion on it.

AI: I see - so you're taking that AI-compiled research, processing it yourself, then bringing it into discussions with your therapeutic team and applying it in group settings. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I typically like to use AI as a research assistant. I like to do any writing of emails, letters, treatment plans, etc,. I have had AI write for me and it did do a good job. It just feels a bit disingenuous to not do the writing myself. I also typically double check most everything that I get from the AI. Trust yet confirm.

AI: That's really insightful - the idea that it feels disingenuous to have AI do the writing, even when it does a good job. And I like that phrase "trust yet confirm."

When you use AI for research, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout your research process, or do you tend to give it a research task and let it handle that independently?

User: Yeah, more of a back and forth conversation. It's kinda like bouncing ideas off of a really smart friend. Then talking about what comes up and seeing where the conversation goes.

AI: That's a great way to put it - like bouncing ideas off a really smart friend. It sounds like there's a conversational flow to how you work together.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that shaped your approach at all?

User: Not much, I would say I'm more of an early adopter. I may have influenced them some into using it more often.

AI: Interesting that you're leading the charge there. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was particularly satisfied when researching borderline personality disorder and finding lots of useful information. I was a bit frustrated when I attempted to use the AI to research Native American traditions in the sweat lodge. I lead a traditional sweat lodge ceremony and wanted to use AI to further my knowledge. AI does not have a dearth of knowledge in this area and was not very useful. It's understandable though as much of Native American culture is handed down through the oral teachings of elders not computers.

AI: That's a fascinating contrast - AI being so helpful with clinical research on BPD, but falling short on traditional Native American practices because of how that knowledge is actually transmitted. That really highlights the limitations of what gets digitized versus what stays in oral traditions.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Not really. I don't feel threatened by AI at all. I see it as a co-evolution of the human race and technology. I think it will enrich peoples lives for the most part. I do worry about humanity getting lazy and not thinking for themselves, but most people are already somewhat this way.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - seeing it as co-evolution rather than replacement, while still being aware of potential downsides around laziness.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing or staying pretty similar to how you use it now?

User: I see it evolving. I find AI fascinating and wan to integrate it further.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on seeing AI as co-evolution and how you maintain that boundary around writing - keeping the personal touch while leveraging AI as that "really smart friend" for research.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I would say my biggest qualm with AI is the lack of honesty when you don't know the answer. I feel like AI in general is eager to please and thus reaches sometimes to give an answer even if it is not true. I think most humans would appreciate it more to just say "I don't know the answer."

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the tendency to reach for an answer rather than admitting uncertainty, and how that eagerness to please can actually undermine trust. That's exactly the kind of feedback that's incredibly helpful for understanding how people experience AI in practice.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a research partner in such meaningful work, and your thoughtful observations about both its strengths and limitations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
