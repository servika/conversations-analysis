Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a web developer and software developer, web apps and android apps primarily. A typical project is setting up a business website or a website for one of the apps I'm developing, creating content for it from graphics to blog articles and writing copy that converts lookers into customers.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse set of creative challenges - from the technical development work to the visual design and persuasive writing. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I rely heavily on AI tools for content creation, a lot of working on the main pages in the site relies on copy that converts and AI helps me A/B test and find something that fits the feel of the site. I use it for programming and occasionally graphics but primarily marketing copy is where I lean heavily on AI.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI has become particularly central to your copywriting and marketing work. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I used AI most recently to come up with and then refine the landing page copy for a client who runs a tattoo studio. She wanted something that fits her style so I told AI about her and the specific project goals and the task of writing the main copy. I work through it from top to bottom and then go back through again to find weaknesses and identify ways it could be better. It makes me feel a bit more confident in the marketing copy before I hand it over to a client but there are also issues like sounding too cliche or not finding the right tone.

AI: That's a fascinating process - it sounds like you're using AI as both a creative partner and then a critic of its own work. Tell me more about that back-and-forth process you described - when you go through to find weaknesses and identify improvements, what does that look like?

User: Ok so I start typically with describing the client and goals and such and then ask for the very first line on the website and really refine it before going much further because it sorta sets the tempo. I then go on from there to each individual section whether its telling about features of a SaaS product or describing the tattoo studio or business and who they serve. basically I ask for copy that converts for each section. once I get  something I feel confident with I start a new conversation or choose a new model and send it through and ask for critical feedback pros and cons. I use that feedback as guidance for the replacement text, explaining why I like parts the model picked as not great or highlighting areas I don't like. I then ask for two or three versions depending on how I feel about it. The goal being to find issues before it gets to the client and sometimes I'll use multiple models to bounce ideas around and brainstorm ways to improve it

AI: That's a really sophisticated workflow - using different models and fresh conversations to get unbiased feedback, almost like assembling your own creative review team. 

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm driving the decisions but I get AI to identify weaknesses in the copy. I'm not particularly attached to it so anything can go and then ultimately I decide on which one is better. Sometimes I'll do an A/B test and show both to the client and we sorta pick out what is best or send both out and display copy A to one visitor and copy B to another visitor and see which one gets more clients through the door. It helps me do more work in a short amount of time and offer a higher level of service

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've found a way to maintain creative control while leveraging AI's analytical capabilities to scale up your output and quality. The A/B testing approach is particularly clever.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I've always struggled with writing copy, I've studied it extensively and understand what does and doesn't work but actually getting the words onto a page has always been a challenge for me. The thing that changed the most is being able to feel confident that what I have is going to work and spending the time on refining it instead of coming up with one thing I can try five different things until I get two that I like so much I can't decide between. It makes it so I'm delivering something closer to the high end marketing firms as an individual working from home.

AI: That's such a compelling insight - it sounds like AI has helped you bridge the gap between knowing what good copy looks like and actually producing it. You mentioned being able to compete with high-end marketing firms now as an individual.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm highly optimistic. I think the programming side of things and AI are more concerning than marketing and as a solo founder I'm not as worried about being put out of work as some people might be. For me, AI is empowering but I'm not just collecting a paycheck everything I do is either worth something or worth nothing and I won't know until later on if it works or not. If I worked for a company that found clients and I was writing the copy for them on a large team I might worry about job security but for my situation, I find it helpful. I think using it without asking for refinements creates a word salad that sounds very similar to everything out there. I'll occasionally send a landing page back through and the feedback is something along the lines of "this is very generic" or what have you. Overall I don't think AI will harm my marketing efforts and it will only get better and make me more productive.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - you're seeing AI as a productivity multiplier rather than a replacement, especially in your role as a solo founder where the results speak for themselves.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think the next step is to have something like an IDE but for marketing. I'd really love to be able to tell one thing all of the goals and everything about the product or business and work on creative assets without telling it the same thing over and over. The context limits are something I bump into quite often and arbitrary limits put in place by AI companies to limit usage is really annoying. I think in the next few years it will be common to just have a cloud computer with a dedicated AI environment instead of paying for individual subscriptions for image generation, video generation etc just one main control panel that creates marketing and creative assets to reach the same goals and with the same quality without struggle. Image and video generation especially is hard to get reliable assets from though its improving.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has helped you bridge that gap between understanding what good copy should look like and actually being able to produce it confidently - that seems like such a fundamental creative challenge that AI is helping solve.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think thats it, I'm more optimistic than some people and really reliant on coming up with something good for my clients I can deliver a higher quality product thanks to AI and it has genuine results but at the same time sometimes I'll have to refine and refine or a model will be great one day and not as great the next week or for a different project so I do use multiple models as a result which I find to be really important in getting a better idea of what is possible and finding things to consider in the future.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using multiple models strategically, the importance of that iterative refinement process, and how AI has empowered you as a solo founder to compete at a higher level - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the practical challenges, like context limits and model inconsistency. That kind of honest perspective is exactly what helps us understand how these tools are actually working in the real world.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your projects!
