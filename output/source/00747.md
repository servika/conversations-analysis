Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions, lets begin!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: AI is mostly used as a tool to help answer questions we may have about how to do things or suggestions on what to do if something goes wrong. We each carry a handheld device and there is an app specifically for an 'AI bot' that we can ask questions.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're using AI as a real-time problem-solving resource right there on the job. 

Can you walk me through what a typical situation looks like when you reach for that handheld device to ask the AI bot a question?

User: Sure. For example, I may find an item that is not fit for sale - a broken item perhaps - that needs to be defected out. If I don't know how to defect an item, I can use the AI app on my handheld device and simply ask "How do I defect an item unfit for sale?" and it will give me the step-by-step process.

AI: That paints a really clear picture - having that immediate access to step-by-step guidance right when you encounter an unfamiliar situation.

Tell me more about the types of problems or situations that typically prompt you to turn to the AI bot. Are they mostly procedural questions like the defecting example, or do you find yourself asking it about other kinds of issues too?

User: You are able to ask it just about anything. A different type of situation might be suggestions on what to do if there is a power outage and the cash register isn't working. Or what to do if there are other unforeseen issues that may pop up.

AI: It sounds like the AI bot serves as a really versatile troubleshooting partner for you - covering everything from routine procedures to unexpected situations that might not come up very often.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: In my situation, I believe the AI bot is very useful. If I have a question, it's nice to have immediate access to a resource that can help me solve the problem instead of having to find a team leader or another employee. It can save time for me and that other employee.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the immediate availability really stands out as a key benefit you're describing.

You mentioned how it saves time for both you and other employees. When you do use the AI bot for these questions, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it to work through a problem, or do you tend to ask your question and get the answer you need right away?

User: Usually, I get the answer right away because the AI's response is very thorough with a step-by-step guide. If I have any follow-up questions though, I can ask them and the AI responds with deeper information on the topic.

AI: That's helpful to understand - so it typically gives you what you need in that first response, but you have the option to dig deeper when necessary.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? For instance, do you notice differences in how people on your team approach using the AI bot?

User: The AI bot is relatively new, so not everyone knows it's a tool at their disposal. Those that do know have had positive things to say about it. My leaders seem to really like it because it also helps them solve more complicated problems or advice on tricky situations.

AI: That's really interesting that it's still in the early adoption phase and that even your leaders are finding value in it for more complex situations.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My above example about defecting an item was a real-life experience for me. I had a particular question about an odd item to defect and the AI was able to give me the steps to find a solution with no issue. It was very satisfying.

AI: That sounds like a great example of the AI bot working exactly as intended - giving you confidence to handle an unfamiliar situation smoothly.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My job is mostly physical so AI is more of a helpful tool for me than something that can potentially take over. I have considered this for other positions at my work, but my personal work is pretty much unaffected.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - recognizing how the physical nature of your role creates a different relationship with AI than what others might experience.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as you become more familiar with it, or as the technology develops further?

User: I can see it evolving to be a great training tool for new employees. I'm usually tasked with training new employees so having an AI tool specifically tailored for a 'learning' environment can be very useful.

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - thinking about AI as a training resource that could enhance how you help new employees learn. It sounds like you can see real potential there.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the physical nature of your job creates a different dynamic with AI than others might experience, and your vision for using it as a training tool.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of - I think that's it!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an immediate problem-solving resource, the early adoption dynamics in your workplace, and especially your vision for its potential as a training tool will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through those real examples - it gives us a much clearer picture of how AI is fitting into work environments like yours. Have a great rest of your day!
