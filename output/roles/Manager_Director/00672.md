Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions from me, ready to get started.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for "how to" questions as it relates to work. I use it to replace using calculators as it would relate to any calculations. I use it to analyze documents. I use it to seek advice regarding management situations to see how it responds and if it can account for anything I may have not. I use it a lot for research related purposes.

AI: That's a nice range of different uses. I'm particularly curious about the management situations you mentioned - could you walk me through what that looks like? When you're facing a management challenge, how do you typically approach seeking that advice from AI?

User: A few different situations as it relates to management. I use AI to role play conversations with an employee. Let's say it's a challenging conversation, I've received customer complaints and want to role play the conversation prior to have the actual conversation with the person. I also used it to analyze a company that I was considering purchasing as a Small Business. I asked numerous questions as it related to that that involved research, document analysis and financial planning. I use it as it relates to financial planning for my current business and analyzing documents to see where I can potentially make better use of funds. I also use it to search the web and gather customer ratings across numerous platforms to see how we're doing. Example, I like to see how ratings are on google, yelp, angi and trust advisor. I would ask AI to search for revised and convert it to a 5 scale rating for a specific timeframe and to capture all related customer comments. I also ask for it to show me trends of what customers are saying.

AI: That's fascinating - you're really using AI as a comprehensive business partner across so many different functions. 

Tell me more about the role-playing piece with difficult employee conversations. When you're preparing for one of those challenging discussions, what does that interaction with AI actually look like? How do you set it up?

User: I share with AI what I'm doing and specifics of the situation. Example, I'm going to have a conversation with an employee as I've received 3 customer complaints. This is not the first time I've had a conversation with this person. These are the 3 customer concerns, this is what the customer said. This is how I plan to approach the conversation. I then add a specific flow I plan on taking to ensure the conversation stays on track, I ask all questions and provide all feedback to the employee. Once I share that with AI, I then ask for feedback and suggestions. I then start a new conversation and share with the AI I'm going to have a difficult conversation with an employee and want it to take on the persona of the employee. I then go through that conversation and incorporate any feedback I received from the previous conversation with AI into

AI: That's really thorough - so you're essentially doing two separate sessions, one for strategizing and getting feedback, then another where AI becomes the employee for practice. 

When AI is playing the role of your employee in that practice conversation, how realistic does that feel to you? Does it help you anticipate how the actual conversation might go?

User: It feels realistic. Some situations that arise during the conversation are straight forward and what you would expect in a conversation regarding employee performance but some things shared make me think further and prepare further for my actual conversation with the employee. It allows me to fully do my due diligence so I'm prepared prior to kicking off that conversation with the employee.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like AI helps you think through angles you might not have considered on your own.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: If it relates to anything time sensitive or that may be flexible, like the time a location closes or setting up an appointment, many times that can be searched online and AI can find that information for me but I do like to do that myself and ensure nothing is missed nor is there a special circumstance that's misinterpreted. Also, sometimes as it relates to math, I like to do that myself. I use AI for that too but sometimes, do it myself too. Same with anything financial related, I use AI but do double check for accuracy and to make sure I didn't overlook anything when providing the information to AI.

AI: So it sounds like accuracy and verification are really important to you, especially with time-sensitive or financial information. You mentioned double-checking AI's work on financial matters - what drives that need to verify? Have you encountered situations where the AI missed something or got it wrong?

User: Yes, there have been times when AI has been wrong when providing something such as a calculation or reviewing a financial document. There have also been times where I missed giving AI something it needed to be accurate so double checking helps me cover both of those scenario's.

AI: That's a really practical approach - catching both AI errors and your own input gaps. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Both however I would say I more likely collaborate with it. I do delegate at times but since I'm involved in it and review it's accuracy, that's still somewhat collaborating with it I guess.

AI: That's an interesting point - even when you delegate, you're still staying involved through that review process. 

Can you give me an example of what that collaboration looks like in practice? Maybe walk me through a recent task where you were working back and forth with AI?

User: Yes, I recently shared company expenses year to date and asked AI to categorize it. From Month over Month income to advertising expenses, personnel expenses, utilities, insurance, franchise expenses and asked it to group these into groupings based on the categories and to do it month over month. It provided a nice layout and then I asked for a few calculations based on that such as gross revenue percentage, percentages of personnel expenses versus industry averages. I also asked it to analyze where my largest area's of opportunities are. I then dug deeper there to evaluate what was realistic to make an impact on. Then brainstormed goals as to what I would like revenue to be and how would we get there based on what I provided. It was a back and forth but a good exercise to learn about where my opportunities are.

AI: That's a great example of real collaboration - you started with data organization, then kept building on the analysis with more specific questions. It sounds like each response from AI sparked your next question.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you discuss AI usage with others, or is it something you've adopted more independently?

User: I do discuss it regularly with others but not sure I've influenced them or if they use it more as a result of these conversations. I have however had friends and family begin to use it and shared examples of how they can do so.

AI: So it sounds like you're pretty open about sharing your AI experiences beyond just work colleagues - with friends and family too. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Very satisfied when using it to search the web and gather business reviews on my small business from numerous external sites that people leave reviews on. It was able to pull those reviews for specific timeframes and convert them to a 5 point scale along with comments. This is something that would've taken an extremely long time for me to do but it did it quickly. On the other side, I asked this to do the same for competitors of mine within a 10 mile radius so I could compare them against my ratings. It did so however missed a few competitors which was frustrating.

AI: That's such a clear contrast - the time savings on your own business reviews versus the frustration of incomplete competitor data. When AI missed those competitors, how did you handle that? Did you go back and try to get it to find the missing ones?

User: I did, once I realized a couple where missed, I shared those specific competitor names with AI and asked they both share why they were missed and to share the ratings I originally asked for.

AI: And when you gave it those specific names, was it able to explain why it missed them and then provide the ratings you wanted?

User: It did, it was basically the industry that my company name was in and when it searched the internet, it overlooked them because of what they said they were in compared to what my company's website stated it's business was.

AI: That's really insightful - so it was essentially a categorization issue where the competitors weren't describing themselves the same way you describe your business. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It's not something I've considered. I assume you mean training. For training, I usually do that through my franchisor or search for actual financial courses.

AI: That makes sense that you focus on formal training through established channels. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future, or expanding how you work with it?

User: At the moment, I do not envision it changing. If there were a reason I could use it that I'm not thinking of, I would definitely do so but at the moment I can't think of any reason I could use it more.

AI: That's a fair perspective - it sounds like you've found a solid set of use cases that work well for you.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated hearing about how you've developed that two-stage approach for employee conversations - the strategy session followed by role-playing - that seems like a really smart way to prepare thoroughly.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all I can think of!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a comprehensive business partner - from financial analysis to employee management to competitor research - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been great learning about your practical, collaborative approach to working with AI. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
