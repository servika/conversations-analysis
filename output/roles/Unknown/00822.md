Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like myself into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, and I currently do not have any questions for you. Feel free to begin.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Most of the AI tools I use at work focus on generating both still and moving visual content through platforms like Sora, Midjourney, Veo, Kling, and Adobe. It's no longer uncommon or unusual for clients to request AI-generated material, either fully generated by AI or integrated into traditional, practical filmmaking workflows. Usually the primary motivation behind this is the significant cost savings it offers to clients.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI-generated visual content has become a standard part of client expectations. 

Tell me more about how you navigate between fully AI-generated material versus integrating AI into traditional filmmaking workflows. What drives that decision?

User: I typically try to promote the use of AI-generated content in a creative way, where it's blended in with traditional filmmaking (e.g., practically shoot the diner setting and create an AI-generated Breaking News Report for the background television with AI) rather than just completely relying on the full content being AI-generated. This allows a bit more appreciation by the audience.

AI: That's a really interesting approach - using AI as a creative tool within traditional production rather than replacing the whole process. 

When you say it allows "more appreciation by the audience," what do you think audiences are responding to when they see that blend versus fully AI-generated content?

User: It's similar to how the typical audience might presume a scene was shot with CGI, only to find out it was completely shot practically. If the audience assumes a scene was completely AI-generated, but was only a secondary usage within the scene, it might not completely diminish that appreciation from the audience.

AI: That's a really insightful comparison - the element of surprise or discovery seems important to maintaining that connection with audiences.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your filmmaking process you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Realistically, I would prefer to focus only on traditional filmmaking, because that's what makes filmmaking fun. But filmmaking can be EXPENSIVE. Hiring the cast and crew, renting out the location, and obtaining permits, just to name a few. And if all you need are some simple b-roll shots that might not even be noticed by the audience, why not just generate with AI and save hundreds or thousands of dollars?

AI: That's a really honest perspective - the tension between what's creatively fulfilling and what's financially practical. It sounds like you're making strategic decisions about where to invest those limited resources.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: The process usually begins with the client's request, which often defines how extensively AI will be integrated into their  content. At this stage, most requests fall into two categories: either fully AI-generated content or projects with no AI involvement at all.

AI: So it sounds like the level of AI integration is largely determined upfront by client preferences rather than something you're deciding task-by-task during production.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are you finding that others in the industry are approaching it similarly, or are you seeing different perspectives?

User: Even though the filmmaking industry still continues to incorporate AI-generated content into its material, it's also still heavily frowned upon, especially by the filmmakers themselves. There are those filmmakers I've worked with who really appreciate the possibilities with AI-generated content and see its disruption as inevitable innovation. I think it goes for the same with other industries, where they are facing similar disruptions. As for me, I think it's important to adapt with it rather than to fight it.

AI: That tension between inevitability and resistance sounds really complex to navigate professionally. It seems like you've found a middle ground with your approach.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The frustration continues to diminish as AI-generated content continues to improve, and quite quickly. It was maybe only a year or two ago when certain features we have today weren't available back then, like scenes, moodboards, audio-sync, etc. These features allow a more precise generation of what one imagined, as to back then, when everything was relying on sophisticated text prompts.

AI: It sounds like the rapid improvement in AI tools has made them much more practical for your actual workflow needs. That shift from relying purely on text prompts to having more precise control features seems significant.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I've been in this situation before, like when developing film in dark rooms became obsolete, or the use of mini DVs and DVDs as well. There's a constant need to learn and adapt to new changes while retiring ones that have become obsolete. This is no different with AI generation.

AI: That historical perspective is really valuable - you've seen multiple waves of technological change in your industry already. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you personally or for filmmaking more broadly?

User: I don't see it going anywhere. If anything, it would only continue to improve and be incorporated into all creative aspects. I see its advantages and disadvantages, and like I've said, I only plan to adapt to it rather than fight it. I personally think I will continue to  incorporate it more into my work, including by client request, but to incorporate it in a creative manner, rather than a lazy manner.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on adapting rather than resisting technological change, and how you're finding creative ways to blend AI with traditional filmmaking rather than simply replacing one with the other.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating the creative and financial tensions in filmmaking, and how you're strategically incorporating AI while maintaining the craft elements that make the work fulfilling, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candid perspective on this evolving landscape.
