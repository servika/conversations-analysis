Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good to me

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I have been using it a lot recently for marketing planning and content creation. Also for HR questions and templates.

AI: That's really interesting - marketing, content creation, and HR work covers quite a range. 

Can you walk me through what a specific example looks like? Maybe pick one of those areas and describe how you actually use AI for it?

User: So for marketing, our marketing manager recently left. I work for a small business so she did all our marketing and I have needed to pick up the marketing. We didn't want to immediately recruit a replacement but wanted to see what we could use AI to help. I asked an AI to review our company website and put together a plan of weekly LinkedIn posts and monthly blogs based on the content on our website. It did a plan and I asked it to write the posts and blogs. I then asked it to review all the content it had produced and make sure it didn't sound like it was written by an AI. I then asked it to review the website again and give me hashtags to use on the posts.

AI: That sounds like a pretty comprehensive approach to handling the marketing gap. 

When you were going through that process - from the initial plan all the way to the hashtags - how much back-and-forth did you find yourself having with the AI? Were you mostly giving it one big task at a time, or was it more of an ongoing conversation where you were refining things together?

User: It was an ongoing conversation as I was refining what I needed to ask and there were also times where it got confused what I was asking.

AI: Tell me more about those moments when it got confused. What was happening there?

User: I started the conversation in the morning and then there were a couple of gaps in the conversation, time wise when I was doing other things. When I went back to the conversation I found it had forgotten what we were talking about. For example it wrote me some random LinkedIn posts not about our company.

AI: That must have been frustrating when you came back expecting it to remember the context. 

How did you handle those moments when the AI had lost track? Did you find yourself developing any strategies for working around that?

User: I told it that it seemed to have forgotten where we were up to and asked it to review the earlier conversation. It did and we got back on track with being relevant to the company but it then wrote all the blogs and linkedin posts again. I didn't need this but will be able to use the post content for next year.

AI: So you ended up with extra content you could use later - that's an interesting silver lining to the confusion.

Thinking about that whole marketing project, are there parts of that process you preferred to handle yourself, even though the AI could have potentially helped with those pieces too?

User: Thinking about it, I have still got two versions of each monthly blog it wrote which I was going to review and see which was better and/or amalgamate each pair but I could go back to the AI and ask it to do that for me. I also wish I'd told it use UK English not US English.

AI: That's a good point about the UK English - those details can really matter for your brand voice.

When you think about reviewing those blog versions and deciding which is better or how to combine them, what draws you toward wanting to do that review yourself rather than having the AI handle it?

User: I thought it would have used UK English given the company has a UK web address. I think with the blog posts, I feel I will have to review them and edit/tweak them anyway.

AI: So it sounds like you're planning to put your own eyes on the final content regardless. 

What is it about that final review and tweaking process that feels important for you to handle personally?

User: Yes. I want to make sure that the tone of voice sounds like our company (even though I asked it to write in the tone of our previous blogs) and I want to make sure it doesn't sound like it's been written by an AI.

AI: That makes sense - maintaining that authentic company voice seems really important to you.

When you're doing that final review, how can you tell when something sounds too AI-generated? What are the telltale signs you look for?

User: Too much punctuation. Especially hyphens. Something slightly cheesy in style!

AI: Ha! The hyphens and cheesy style - that's a very specific tell.

I'm curious about how your colleagues or workplace culture has influenced the way you're using AI for this marketing work. Since you mentioned it's a small business, how do others there feel about this approach to handling the marketing gap?

User: They're all for it as it helps save time and money. As long as it is authentic.

AI: That's helpful that you have that support, especially with the authenticity piece being a shared priority.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: With my HR hat on we have just been through a redundancy process and whilst I got a lot of information from various websites like ACAS, I found it very helpful to have the conversational aspect with the AI to check things and ask questions. For example, I had calculated an individual's remaining holiday allowance and asked the AI to check it. Their calculation was different to mine so I was able to question it.

AI: That sounds like a really valuable use case - having that conversational back-and-forth on something as important as redundancy calculations.

What happened when you questioned the AI about the different holiday calculation? How did that play out?

User: I told it what I had calculated and it worked out how I had got the answer I had and how it had got a different answer. It was about how the carry forward from 2024 was treated and in querying it I was able to see that what I had calculated was correct.

AI: That's a great example of using the AI as a thinking partner to work through a complex problem. It sounds like the process of explaining your reasoning to each other helped you confirm your approach was right.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do worry that potentially AI will takeover but at the end of the day people want to interact with people so I hope that AI will become a more and more useful tool but that there will still be the need for human interaction. I am also learning new skills by using AI.

AI: That's interesting that you see it as learning new skills through using AI. 

What kinds of new skills do you feel you're developing as you work with these tools?

User: I'm learning how to write prompts in a way that gives me the answer I want in the style I want and how to interact with the AI to get it to produce the most helpful answer for me. For example, remembering to ask for UK English!

AI: That prompt crafting skill seems like it's becoming quite valuable! 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you and your business?

User: I think we will use it more and more as people get more confident. We are very mindful though about not having the team use any platform they want and also I am very cautious about using any of our real company data.

AI: Those are really thoughtful considerations around platform control and data security.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that conversational back-and-forth process with the holiday calculation - it's a great example of AI as a thinking partner rather than just a task executor.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from managing marketing transitions to navigating complex HR calculations have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
