Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yeah that all sounds good, please go ahead with your first question!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: So I have only recently started as an Auditor, and naturally there are a bunch of terms and concepts that I'm still committing to long term memory. So, currently I have been using AI to help me quickly understand and apply certain terms and ideas.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you say you use AI to understand and apply terms and ideas, what does that interaction typically look like? Are you asking for definitions, or is there more to it?

User: Yeah mainly definitions and regulations understanding. Say I was tasked with checking between accounts, I would search up certain definitions like capital expenditure to remind me where I should be looking for those items or what certain things should add up to.

AI: So you're using it as a quick reference tool when you're in the middle of actual audit work. When you get those definitions or explanations about regulations, how do you typically use that information? Do you apply it directly to what you're working on, or does it help you figure out your next steps?

User: A bit of both really. I have used and applied it directly to things I was working on e.g. giving a summary based on accounts information, and have used it to think up next steps in finishing my work.

AI: That's interesting that it serves both purposes for you. When you mention having AI give summaries based on accounts information - can you walk me through what that looked like? What kind of information were you working with and what did you need the summary to do?

User: I was working with financial statement information from the previous year and this year, and used that information to talk about trends of certain aspects like Cost of Sales and Revenue generated. Certain pieces of info I needed a definition from an AI which improved my efficiency, and when I mean summaries I mean I usually provide my rough ideas to the AI in what I've gathered and understood from the statements, from which the AI then helps me polish it up and/or tweak some of my understanding.

AI: That's a really clear picture of how you're working together with AI. It sounds like you're bringing your own analysis and observations to the conversation, then using AI to refine and polish your thinking. 

When you say it helps "tweak some of my understanding" - can you think of a specific instance where the AI changed or corrected something in your initial analysis?

User: I don't fully remember the specifics, but there was one time where I was misunderstanding an assets comparison between years, and wrote something I thought the statements were telling me, but the AI helped in explanaining how it wasnt how I initially thought and that certain assets go in different places.

AI: That sounds like a valuable catch. When something like that happens - when the AI corrects or redirects your understanding - how does that feel for you as someone who's still learning the field?

User: It's generally a good feeling, like I feel satisfied and appreciative of technology in being that helpful friend I can constantly ask questions too. However, I do always take everything with a pinch of salt because of course, you can never 100% rely on AI. If something doesn't seem right in an explanation or a tweak, I ask my seniors when they're free to double-check.

AI: That approach of checking with your seniors when something doesn't seem right is really thoughtful. I'm curious - are there certain types of audit tasks where you prefer to work through things yourself first, even though AI could potentially help? What makes you choose to tackle something on your own versus reaching out to AI?

User: Yeah for sure, I think I always try and do the first of a "class" of tasks always by myself. I value the "butting your head" against a problem method since that develops my brain connections. Also, any work that involves Maths and numbers I will do myself since I really enjoy that type of work too. I reach out to AI when I need the help with definitions or those summaries (after I have already done at least one).

AI: That's a really deliberate approach to your learning. I love that phrase about "butting your head" against problems to develop those brain connections. 

When you do that first attempt at a new type of task completely on your own, what happens after you've worked through it? Do you ever go back and see what AI might have suggested, or do you keep those completely separate?

User: So far, I havent gone back to ask what AI thinks of it since I will ask the seniors if what I did was good work. Once I've done that, then I know what to look for/expect for a good "solution" to my problems. Then, for subsequent tasks of the same nature I'm more happy to go to AI since I roughly know what a "good solution" looks like.

AI: That's a really smart system you've developed - establishing your own baseline understanding through senior feedback before bringing AI into the mix. 

How have your colleagues or supervisors reacted to you using AI tools in your audit work? Has that influenced how or when you use it?

User: I think the company generally supports it so long as we're not providing any client information to it of course or any other delicate matter. It does feel weird if I'm near a higher up and I use it since it almost feels like cheating, but they don't mind and I'm slowly losing that feeling of "cheating">

AI: That feeling of it being like "cheating" is really interesting, especially since you're losing that feeling over time. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've never really been frustrated with it so far since of course I'm only giving small things for the AI to do and not expecting it to do my job. But particularly satisfied, I mean other than that asset thing I told you about earlier where it helped me, but even then I had to double check with a senior, but it does make me satisfied just with the definitions and cut down of research.

AI: That cut down in research time sounds really valuable when you're trying to learn so much at once. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider as you're developing your audit expertise?

User: I remember my higher ups making it clear that Audit work will always stay around and there is a lot of grey area in Audit too. So the skills I'm mainly focusing on, and this is more personal to me, is just social skills and networking. This of course is a skill that AI will not likely be able to compete in. Other than that, I haven't really focused on competing with AI in certain skills, all I know is that if I work hard, keep improving my problem solving, and my social skills, then I'll be fine.

AI: That focus on social skills and networking makes a lot of sense, especially in a field like auditing where relationships and judgment calls are so important.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving as you gain more experience in auditing?

User: I'm goin to assume that as the years go by, AI will improve in being able to handle and work with large, complex, multi-modal data, and so if I can see a future where I'm able to deleggate more complex tasks to it and use it as an effective second brain.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using that "butting your head against problems" approach for learning, and how you've developed such a deliberate system of trying things yourself first before bringing AI into subsequent similar tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I mean I've kind of mentioned it already, but I am scared right now to give it any information of any client. For example, all my rough summaries I give have been fake numbers and fake company names. This was instilled to us by my company and so I'm not sure how large of an effect that has played in me not using AI more.

AI: That's a really important point you've raised - the fact that you have to scrub all the real data and use fake numbers and company names. That must add quite a bit of extra work to the process of getting AI help.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about learning as a new auditor and how you're thoughtfully integrating AI into that process will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
