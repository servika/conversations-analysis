Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good to me. No questions here.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do landscaping and garden design. My current project is a herbal tea farm that I am in charge of designing and building from the ground up. I use the AI to help me plan my beds and to help make researching plants more effective. I then use the AI to take that information and produce planting plans. I also use it to help troubleshoot when plants are sick. My most recent task included helping design and plan ways to insulate a greenhouse I am building.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project! I'm intrigued by how you're using AI across different aspects of the herbal tea farm - from the initial planning all the way through to troubleshooting plant health issues.

When you mention using AI to help make researching plants more effective, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: I live in a drought prone area where the summers get very hot and humid. This makes growing anything as a crop challenging. Typically I will begin by requesting a list of herbs that fit a criteria ( help fight depression) and grow well in my zone. I then take that list and request further information such as the growing conditions.  Depending on what I am working on sometimes that is all I need, but sometimes I will request further information such as how to companion plant them, how to incorporate them so they look more natural, how big will the plant be in 3 years, etc. Sometimes this occurs in one long conversation and sometimes if I am in the garden it maybe a quick question.

AI: That's a really smart approach - starting broad with the criteria and then drilling down into the specific details you need. It sounds like the AI helps you navigate through layers of information efficiently.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: The only task that I prefer to do myself is the drawing of the beds and organizing the herbs into list. I could have the AI do both, but by drawing and writing the names I am better able to remember what I am doing when I am actually working on it. Often times I even incorporate AI into this. The work I enjoy the most is the physical part which the AI cannot do so I actually use the AI for most things.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the physical act of drawing and writing as a way to cement the information in your memory for when you're out there actually implementing the plan. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Typically I am working with the AI collaboratively. This is because my plans change depending on the information the AI gives me typically. For instance I may plan to plant a bed full of a certain flower and then when collaborating with the AI find that the flower actually grows better in a different locations which requires me to change the plan. If I am in the beginning phases of planning and just need list or straight forward answers then I will have the AI complete task on its own, but more often I am using it collaboratively.

AI: That collaborative approach really comes through - it sounds like the AI helps you discover things that reshape your thinking as you go. The example about the flower needing different conditions than you initially planned is a perfect illustration of that.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I work mostly independently, however, I have been able to use AI to help me better explain concepts and ideas to customers. I am busier in the warmer months so the AI has really helped to reduce my time planning. These two things alone have helped alleviate stress and hours spent looking through sights or books and switching between screens. It has not only helped me be more efficient, but I am also able to use it to further educate myself which I can then teach to the customers. This has built better bonds and a more trusting relationship which has only helped my business grow.

AI: That's really interesting how AI has become a tool not just for your own work, but for enhancing your customer relationships through better explanations and education. It sounds like it's had a ripple effect on your business growth.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I feel as though any negative experiences that I have had were minor and mainly were formatting issues. Typically if I am struggling with the AI it is because I am struggling to communicate my needs clearly. I feel satisfied with my work with AI on most days, but most recently I used the AI to educate myself on Goldenrod. I used the AI to learn how to harvest, when to harvest, and how to dry it as well as how to successfully propagate the plants. I was very satisfied with this because I was able to do it while pulled over on the side of the road sitting next to a growth of Goldenrod that I had just discovered. I was then able to harvest and dry it all before the days end. This typically would have involved a full days worth of work with multiple trips to the growth site to confirm the correct plant, etc.

AI: What a perfect example of AI fitting seamlessly into your workflow! Being able to identify, learn about, and successfully harvest the Goldenrod all in one day - right there on the spot - that's incredible efficiency compared to the traditional back-and-forth process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have considered that for other aspects of my life, but since I do manual labor that involves being in tune with nature and working carefully with it I am not concerned. My main concern with AI is the environmental impact it has in the areas around its plants. I struggle with using it to plan garden beds that are meant to improve the very environment that the AI plants are destroying. If the environmental impact were not so high then I would use it more honestly.

AI: That's such a thoughtful perspective - the irony of using AI to design environmentally beneficial gardens while being concerned about AI's environmental footprint. It sounds like you've found a balance where the efficiency gains are worth it, but that tension is still something you grapple with.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I would like to keep my use at the current level, however, I am sure that I will use it for more than I am currently.  Potentially in the future I may use it to help create content or plan business documents, but I would like to maintain a balance for the environment. This means I will be making conscious decisions on when to use it and when not to.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that environmental tension - using AI to help create environmentally beneficial gardens while being mindful of AI's own environmental impact. That's such a nuanced way to think about the technology.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI collaboratively in landscape design, the way it's enhanced your customer relationships, and your thoughtful approach to balancing efficiency with environmental concerns will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
