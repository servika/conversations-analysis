Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good I dont think I have any questions for now Claude

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: During my typical workday AI may be used to improve automation in things such as matching receipts to transactions in our accounting software and in extracting information from sed receipts. There are times where I will use AI to draft letters and documents (such as contracts)

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI across quite a range of tasks, from the more technical automation work to document creation. 

Tell me more about the receipt matching and information extraction. How does that process work for you day-to-day?

User: Whenever the business receives a cost such as a receipt or invoice we forward it onto our bookkeeping software that extracts all the relevant information from it for accounting purposes - date, date due, supplier, amount, tax amount & payment method etc. This process is done on a daily basis and is useful for allowing manual booking down of the costs onto the correct job sheets

AI: That sounds like a really streamlined process for handling your daily bookkeeping. So the AI extracts all that key information automatically, and then you're manually allocating those costs to the right job sheets.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I definitely prefer to handle booking down the tasks onto the correct job sheets myself as they require knowledge of the jobs that is outside of an AI's capabilities due to needing access to real world information. I also prefer to match the transactions myself with the help of AI but never allowing AI to auto categorise or match transactions due to risks with miskeeping accounts

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're keeping control over the parts that require your specific knowledge about the jobs and maintaining oversight on the financial accuracy side. The risk management aspect around account accuracy is really important.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would typically collaborate with the AI through a task, I might talk with it about what i need it to create in a document and then ask for amendments based on what it creates before checking I'm happy with the final product. When it comes to receipts and invoices I'm happy to send them over to the software which then extracts the information and I'll cast my eye over it before confirming I'm happy with it

AI: So you have this collaborative back-and-forth approach, especially with document creation where you're iterating together to get to the final result. And with the receipt processing, it sounds more like AI does the initial work and you review before confirming.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I have quite a solo role in my workplace as I run the office side of the business myself so this has influenced me in a way that the AI provides a bit of support for what I'm doing, if im comfortable with the work and the AI is then I have a greater degree of confidence in it than if it was just me doing it myself

AI: That's a fascinating perspective - so AI is almost serving as a kind of collaborative partner in what would otherwise be a very solitary role. It gives you that additional layer of confidence when you're both aligned on the work.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: One time we needed to get a contract drafted up pretty quickly and the information available online was very vague with few templates available so I asked an AI to draft an intermediate JCT Contract, it was able to draft it up very quickly and ask me for the input information such as the client details, address, relevant dates etc which saved me hours and hours of typing and research which was really appreciated

AI: That sounds like a really significant time saver - being able to get that specialized contract drafted quickly when you had limited resources available online. It's interesting that the AI was able to prompt you for the specific details it needed rather than you having to figure out what information to provide.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think because all areas of my job do have a level of manual input and nothing is left solely to AI I am always maintaining all the skills that are relevant to my job

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - maintaining that human involvement across all your tasks keeps your skills active. It sounds like you've found a balance where AI enhances your work without completely replacing the core competencies you need.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine as AI gets smarter there will be more areas that I will be able to delegate to AI to complete tasks quicker, I imagine it will be easier to put order sytems in place and easier to collate invoices to put into our bookkeeping software. I think as AI gets smarter there will be more confidence in it from an internal point of view within the company but also externally, customers and clients may feel more secure with things that have been worked on by AI

AI: That's really insightful - you're thinking about AI capability improvements from both the technical efficiency side and the trust-building side, both internally and with clients. The idea that external confidence in AI-assisted work might grow alongside the technology is particularly interesting.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as a collaborative partner in what's otherwise a solo role, and how you maintain that careful balance between efficiency and oversight.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I dont think so Claude, it has been a pleasure speaking with you and I hope I have been of help!

AI: Thank you so much! You've been incredibly helpful - your insights about maintaining that collaborative balance with AI, especially in a solo role, and how you think about risk management while still leveraging AI's efficiency gains, will be really valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences so openly. Have a wonderful rest of your day!

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
