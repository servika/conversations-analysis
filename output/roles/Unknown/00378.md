Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I'm ready

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Overall, I use AI to help me create educational materials that I use during lesson planning for my students. For example, grammatical case charts and such.

AI: That's interesting - creating educational materials sounds like a really practical application. 

Can you walk me through what it's like when you're creating something like those grammatical case charts? How does the process typically unfold from start to finish?

User: Well, I'll have in mind the topics that need to be introduced during the upcoming lessons, and if need be, I can ask an AI model to generate a chart with the vocabulary to be covered, and it simplifies the process of my explaining the terms to the students. I can also the model to generate ideas for starting points for story time with my students.

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you with both the structured content like charts and the more creative aspects like story ideas. 

When you're working on these materials, do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI - refining and adjusting what it gives you - or do you typically get what you need in one go?

User: Generally, if it it something more basic and structural like a chart, the AI model will produce useable content directly, or content that is useable with some small edits. 

If it's something related to story time, whether or not the model creates something useable, the existence of the content generated and my reaction to it is usually enough to create something that I can work with during it.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like with the structural content you're looking for something fairly direct and usable, but with the creative story content, even if the AI doesn't hit the mark perfectly, it still serves as a useful catalyst for your own ideas.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your lesson planning or teaching that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: I don't really believe in using LLMs to assist in grading writing pieces. I know that some colleagues of mine in education are starting to use such methods, but I prefer to keep a close eye on the development of a student's abilities.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining that direct connection to your students' development through grading their writing yourself.

What is it about grading writing specifically that makes you want to keep that human element? What would you lose if you handed that over to AI?

User: Well, if that was handed over to an AI it would lose the human connection that is quintessential to communication. The writings of a student are a form of communication, so they should be observed and analyzed.

AI: That's a powerful point about writing being fundamentally about human communication. It sounds like you see grading as more than just evaluation - it's part of that communicative relationship with your students.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? You mentioned some colleagues are starting to use it for grading - has that created any conversations or tensions?

User: No. It has not created any sort of tension. I recognize that everyone's situation is different with regard to time. I simply, when asked, state my position.

AI: That sounds like a pretty balanced approach - recognizing that different teachers might have different needs while staying clear on your own boundaries.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well, I was very satisfied when I had a limited amount of time to prepare my lesson materials and AI came through in a pinch to help me put together a decent-looking presentation.

AI: That sounds like a real lifesaver moment! 

Can you tell me more about that situation? What made the time crunch happen, and what specifically did the AI help you create for that presentation?

User: Nothing specifically happened, I had just been occupied. The LLM assistant made some charts, headings, and images.

AI: It sounds like having that support when you're stretched thin was really valuable - being able to get the visual and structural elements together quickly.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No I'm not particularly concerned. So long as I know how to use AI assistants I can use them to help me do things in areas where they are helpful.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - viewing AI proficiency itself as the key skill to maintain rather than worrying about individual tasks being automated.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: As of now, I don't see things changing. But if a new product comes out with applicability to my needs, I can consider using it.

AI: That sounds like a pragmatic approach - staying open to new developments while being content with what's working for you now.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on keeping that human connection in grading while being pragmatic about using AI where it genuinely helps with efficiency.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while preserving the human elements that matter most in teaching will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me today!
