Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: sounds good, lets go

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: ye sure. for my workday, i basically are assigned tickets to do or features related to enhance the company website. For instance, in one of my internship, i have to implement a live collaboration feature for the productivity app, so basically allow multiple users to enter the same workspace to collaborate with each other with different widgets, and sync the actions in real time. With this feature, i usually just give the context of this feature to the AI, and ask it to list down the different steps I have to do to complete this feature. Since this feature consists of multiple tasks or steps, i usually choose one task to tackle first and then i'll ask the AI to give me the code to implement this task. For instance, in my live collaboration feature, i have to first initialise a room for users to join the live room so that they could see actions in real time. So I asked the AI to give me the code to create that room with the context and documentation I fed to the AI. After that, most of the time, the code it gave has either lots of bugs, or can't even compile, so I would have to apply my knowledge to understand what's the issue so that I could solve it. Once I understood the error, i would also paste the error messages to the AI so that the AI could understand that the code is not runnable, and I would also give the AI some of my own thoughts on why this issue happens, so the AI could analyse different solutions in solving the bug or issue. With this AI workflow, i'm able to minimise the time to write the code, but at the same time, i still have to face different bugs and tackle it with my own knowledge and with the solutions from the AI.

AI: That's a really detailed picture of your workflow - thank you for walking me through that live collaboration feature example. It sounds like you've developed a pretty structured approach to working with AI on complex development tasks.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you still need to apply your own knowledge to understand and fix issues. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think tasks related to styling i would usually prefer to decide myself. For instance, in the productivity app i'm working on, it uses liquid glass or glassmorphism design, but with AI, the code it gave usually won't apply specific designs or aesthetic designs. So with problem solving tasks, AI would be suitable and think of multiple solutions very quickly, but with the designs and styling, i usually love to tackle and decide it myself. Also, with database schema designs, i usually trust my own thoughts instead of asking the AI with the schema design, because it may not understand the whole app or have the whole context of my app because it is relatively large.

AI: That's really insightful - so you draw the line at creative decisions like styling and architectural decisions like database schema where you need that full context and understanding of the whole system.

When you do use AI for those problem-solving tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Great question. I usually collaborate with it throughout the task until i complete it, because with this constant interaction, the AI could have more context and better solve or implement the feature. When there's bugs that occur from the AI's code, i would constantly fed it with the error message and solve the bug together. Sometimes it might take around 50 turns to actually solve it by keep feeding the messages and context. For instance, with the live collaboration feature, i was stuck in a task to sync the text with the journal widget across multiple users in the same live collab room, but there was issue with the liveblocks yjs storage and y-textarea binding. So i kept interacting with the AI to come up with different potential solutions to solve the bug.

AI: That's fascinating - 50 turns to solve a single bug shows real persistence in that collaborative approach. It sounds like you've found that maintaining that ongoing dialogue helps the AI build up the context it needs.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: One of my colleague actually use cursor and Zed for development, and i've been influenced by him and tried to use it. With cursor, it could understand the context of the codebase so that it could provide more tailored solution, but after using it for some time, i found that although it has more context than external AI chatbox, but it still have lots of bugs when understanding multiple contexts in my codebase, so the experience so far with them is not really optimised or good.

AI: So you tried the integrated AI coding tools after seeing your colleague use them, but found they still struggled with the complexity of your codebase despite having more context access.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: ye sure, i was working with setting up local aws lambda and dynamodb for my internship, and it has been a hassle because i would need to mimic the production environment, backend logic, databases in local development which im confused of. So I used Ai to assist me with this task, and luckily with AI, I'm able to copy all tables and data from my production tables locally, create the serverless.yml file to integrate all my aws lambda functions locally, as well as setup local dynamodb with docker. These scripts and files are all done with AI which I'm really satisfied with.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying win - taking on something as complex as mimicking your entire production AWS environment locally and having AI help you navigate all those moving parts successfully.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Definitely. I'm always thinking about how could i maintain my skills when using AI to solve the daily tasks i have in work. One thought i have is that although i'm using AI to solve the tasks, i still have to apply my own knowledge to solve any bugs or if the code is really suitable, and i would ask AI to explain how the code helps and why you use the code. So i would still try to understand all the code the AI gives rather than just applying it without thinking.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - making sure you understand the "why" behind the code rather than just accepting it blindly. It sounds like you're treating AI as a teaching tool as much as a coding assistant.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think my relationship with AI would keep on evolve as I would keep using it in my daily work tasks. Whether or not i would rely it more would depend on how the AI models would evolve such as the ability to understand the codebase quickly and correctly, as well as not lying about certain things. But Ai would definitely be a good buddy over the next few years in my daily work tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on that collaborative, iterative approach you've developed - going back and forth 50 turns to solve a complex bug really shows how you've found a way to work with AI's strengths while compensating for its limitations.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Ye, one more thing with my experience with AI in my work is that, sometimes there would be more than 100 turns in the same chat, and Ai model would be somewhat laggy and response slower. The reason i dont want to create a new chat is because i want the AI to keep all the context i gave, but if it started to become slower, i would actually create a new chat to talk with the AI. And with this, i actually have to provide it with the context again which is a bit of a hassle.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the tension between wanting to maintain context for better collaboration versus dealing with performance issues as conversations get longer. Having to re-establish all that context when you start fresh definitely sounds like a friction point in your workflow.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that iterative collaboration style, the balance between AI assistance and maintaining your own skills, and even those practical challenges like conversation length will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
