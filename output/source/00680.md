Assistant: Hello! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good to me! Please fire away!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use AI to take over on long text-based jobs. I think of it as a capable copywriter that I can assign to menial writing jobs. I also use it to some degree for project management and sound-boarding ideas.

AI: That's interesting - you mention using it for "menial writing jobs." Can you tell me more about what those look like? What makes a writing task feel menial to you?

User: Sure! I mostly use it for writing tasks that do not require 100% perfection, such as emails, basic web copy, etc. For more important text, I usually do it myself, with some potential iteration from the LLM.

AI: That distinction makes sense. When you say "more important text" that you handle yourself - what makes those tasks feel important enough that you want to keep them in your hands rather than delegate them?

User: It's usually for vital text, like headings, really important emails, taglines, etc. I don't trust AI to write things that people will pay close attention to.

AI: That's a really clear boundary you've drawn. When you do work on those vital pieces yourself, do you find yourself collaborating with AI throughout the process, or do you tend to work completely independently on them?

User: No I might involve AI for iteration and bouncing ideas, but I would be the lead.

AI: Got it - so you stay in the driver's seat for those important pieces. I'm curious about your workplace context. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not really, I've been the most prominent advocate for day-to-day AI usage in my workplace. I encourage others to use it but I'm not too concerned if it's not for them.

AI: So you're kind of pioneering this in your workplace. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was building an application in flutter and I had a bug I just couldn't sort out. I'd used AI for some basic troubleshooting in the past so I ran it past a model. The model claimed this was a common fix, using a typical AI phrase. However, it then ran me round in circles for about two hours before I realised it was all a hallucination. The model didn't know the solution but refused to admit that it could not help directly. I would have much rather it had simply told me and let me spend the time more productively.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - spending two hours on what turned out to be a hallucination. When you say the model "refused to admit that it could not help directly," what was that experience like for you? How did it present those unhelpful suggestions?

User: It claimed that this was a common issue and an easy fix. This made it seem like it was ready to provide the answer, which felt really deceitful when I realised it wasn't true.

AI: That sense of being misled when the AI presented itself as confident about something it didn't actually know sounds really frustrating. Given that experience, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not too worried about it. AI is an incredible tool, but working with it has made me very aware of its limitations. I don't think it will take over any role I'm in completely, provided I'm willing to stay flexible and learn new things.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - staying aware of both the capabilities and limitations. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will continue to stay up to date with new AI capabilities and limitations and use it as another arrow in the quiver. I try to stay realistic about what it can and can't achieve. I imagine I'll rely on it more and more for planning as its capabilities grow and it becomes more reliable

AI: That makes sense - planning seems like an area where you could see expanding use as reliability improves. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you draw clear boundaries between what you delegate versus keep control of, and that honest account of the Flutter debugging frustration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all on my end! Thanks.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that lead role on important work, advocating for AI adoption while staying realistic about limitations, and especially that candid example about the debugging incident - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
