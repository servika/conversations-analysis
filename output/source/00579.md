Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm part of Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI consistently, more for odd pieces of advice or for help researching various topics. Examples of this include when looking into certain areas of academic study I'm involved in asking for researchers who explore similar topics

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like you use AI more as a research assistant when specific needs come up. 

When you do use it for finding researchers or exploring academic topics, can you walk me through what that typically looks like? How do you go about framing those requests?

User: To be honest I don;t trust AI yet to not hallucinate when it comes to this so I just ask quite general questions - like which researchers would back up this idea, then I would go and do my own independent research to see if that researcher does do what the AI suggested

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - using AI as a starting point but then verifying independently. 

Tell me more about that decision to keep your questions general. What does a "general question" look like for you when you're researching academic topics?

User: I mean broad questions - such as which researchers are working to decenter the human, compared to which researchers believes in one specific variable to the topic, as I've found the AI is likely to hallucinate this

AI: I see - so you've learned through experience that the more specific you get, the higher the risk of getting inaccurate information.

Can you tell me about a time when you discovered the AI had given you incorrect details about a researcher or their work? What happened when you went to verify that information?

User: There was one time I was looking for academic papers to back up a specific idea, the AI provided lots of papers but when I googled those papers they had all been hallucinated

AI: That must have been frustrating to discover that none of those papers actually existed. 

How did that experience change the way you approach using AI for your academic work? Did it make you more cautious, or did you develop any specific strategies to work around that risk?

User: It put me off using AI in general for a bit and then I crept back to using it through exploring different ways where I didn't;t have to be so concerned about factual accuracy

AI: That makes a lot of sense - finding your way back to using it in contexts where the stakes feel lower.

What are those different ways you've found to use AI where you don't have to worry as much about factual accuracy? What does that look like for you?

User: Critiquing my own ideas and brainstorming can be very helpful - if I ask the AI simply to form opinions and ideas, these I can then use to expand my own thinking about the topic

AI: That's a really smart adaptation - shifting from asking for facts to asking for perspectives and critique.

When you're using AI to critique your ideas or brainstorm, how do you typically interact with it? Are you going back and forth in a conversation, or do you tend to present your idea and let it give you a complete response to work with?

User: I would say a bit of both

AI: Could you give me an example of what one of those brainstorming or critiquing sessions might look like? Walk me through how a typical conversation with AI unfolds when you're exploring your own ideas.

User: It might start with me presenting one idea I have in specific detail - and asking the AI to critique it. I would then start a conversation with the AI based on the critiques, critically analysing each critique to see if it holds ground

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative process - almost like having a debate partner who challenges your thinking.

When you're critically analyzing those critiques, what helps you decide whether a critique "holds ground" or not? How do you evaluate the AI's challenges to your ideas?

User: I ask it to provide two sides of the story using logical reasoning and then come up with a logical conclusion. One thing that I find holds me back in the AI propensity to agree with me and to flatter me - similar to how you're doing now, originally it made me think I was really on to something and now I understand the pattern of behaviour it loses all meaning and makes me trust less the conclusions it draws

AI: You've made a really important observation there about the AI's tendency to be agreeable and how that affects trust. That's exactly the kind of insight we're looking for.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself using it differently because of how others around you approach it?

User: Yes, people often provide suggestions of how they use it - often people interact with it in really diverse ways so there's a lot of learning to be done of how to use it in different ways from my colleagues

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like there's a lot of informal knowledge sharing happening.

Can you give me an example of a specific way a colleague uses AI that was different from your approach? Something that maybe changed how you think about using it?

User: One colleague uses it a lot to structure her work, she'll set specific goals and et the AI work on her work as a whole, restructuring it to something cleaner. I personally find the idea in ticking as I often find structuring my work difficult but I'm worried about letting the AI have such free rein over my work. I like the work to be done"mine" and I fear that this technique moves the work away from solely mine. AI also tends to have quite similar structures in its writing and I don;t want it to sound like AI

AI: That's a really interesting tension you've identified - the appeal of getting help with something you find difficult versus maintaining ownership of your work and your unique voice.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was one time when I was writing an acamedic paper and I needed some inspiration into different ways a certain phenomenon could have come about. The AI brainstormed some increasingly interesting ideas that paved the way for a far more in-depth paper than I had previously outlined

AI: That sounds like a really productive experience where the AI helped expand your thinking in ways you hadn't expected.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I personally feel like my writing style is currently better than AI so I'm not yet worried about that - infact the areas in which I use AI I'm confident to let it take over.

AI: That confidence in your own writing abilities seems to be a key factor in how comfortable you are with different uses of AI.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself changing how you use it as the technology develops or as you become more experienced with it?

User: If the AI gets better at not hallucinating I see it really helping wit my research - find extracts from different papers, helping to write citations, and finding specific quotes and pieces of work by different researchers

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the AI's tendency to be agreeable actually undermines trust in its conclusions - that's a really astute observation that many people might not pick up on.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we've talked abut the main tensions and capabilities I see

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining ownership of your work, and how you've adapted your approach after encountering hallucinations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the limitations you've experienced. This kind of honest feedback is exactly what helps us understand how AI tools are really being used in practice.

User: Thank you

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
