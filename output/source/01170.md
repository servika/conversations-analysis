Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready.

AI: Great! Let's start with the basics. Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My website is [REDACTED]. Can you take a look at that? It will answer a bunch of questions.

AI:

This is fascinating! So you create custom terrain carvings from hardwood and resin, representing places on Earth, the Moon, and Mars. I can see from your website that these are really beautiful, tactile representations of topographical features. What a unique form of creative work - combining woodworking, geography, and artistry.

Now that I understand what you create, I'm curious: walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: So AI is not involved in the actual creative process for making a terrain carving. Any creative aspects originate entirely from my mind. I do find AI to be useful for secondary aspects of my art, however. I've used AI to generate a business plan template, to generate keywords and tags for my website, to create a product listing template, and to play around with logo generation, among other things. I do have other interests like songwriting, in which I've attempted to use AI for the generation of creative content, mainly lyrics. But these attempts have not proven to be very successful.

AI: That's really interesting - so AI serves more of a business and administrative support role for your terrain carving work, while the actual creative vision and craftsmanship remains entirely yours. 

Tell me more about your songwriting experiences with AI. What made those attempts unsuccessful for you?

User: Well, I have written dozens of songs, but I always find it difficult to write lyrics that I remain happy with. In my last songwriting attempt, maybe 15% of the finished song lyrics were AI-generated. The AI definitely produced some useful and original lyrics, but most attempts returned uninspired and essentially useless results that would not make it into one of my finished songs. Asking for chord progressions or asking for opinions on existing progressions has proven to be fruitless. Boring constructions are praised ("G-C-D sounds great!"), and generated progressions are useless. Similar levels of satisfaction are to had with the AI's abysmal handling of guitar tablature. Where AI has been consistently helpful, however, is is filling secondary tasks. Before AI, I would use either a paper or (usually) an online rhyming dictionary to look up potential vocabulary fitting a specific rhyme/rhythm scheme. Now I can simply ask an AI, for example, for "three-syllable words that rhyme with 'bound' that have dark connotations." AI has been consistently useful for these assistant-type of tasks, but for my admittedly natural approach to songwriting, I'm not ready to rely on AI for the reliable generation of creative and satisfying lyrics or chord progressions.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction you're making. It sounds like AI excels at those lookup and reference tasks - like replacing your rhyming dictionary with something more sophisticated that can filter by syllable count and mood - but falls short when you need genuine creative substance.

When you say AI produced "uninspired and essentially useless results" for lyrics, what was missing? Was it that the content felt generic, or that it didn't match your artistic voice, or something else entirely?

User: Somewhat surprisingly, and thanks to Google Note's version history feature, here's a sample of an AI generated lyrical verse that I rejected. I found it just too explicit and a bit contrived. Further prompting, attempting to emulate certain styles proved unsuccessful as well.   "Your billions can't buy freedom, your mansions built on sand,
The air you breathe, the water, they slip through your command.
You can't pay, won't pay? We echo it right back,
No price tag on justice, no deal on freedom's track."

AI: I can see what you mean - that verse does feel quite heavy-handed and on-the-nose, almost like protest slogans rather than nuanced songwriting. It lacks the subtlety and personal voice that makes lyrics compelling.

When you're working with AI on these secondary tasks - like finding rhyming words with specific connotations - how would you describe that collaboration? Are you finding that AI understands the nuances you're looking for, or do you still need to sift through a lot of suggestions?

User: I'd consider them to be generally successful, satisfying, and reliable. I'm not asking for anything extremely difficult, and the models I use tend to deliver helpful lists of potentially satisfying words of the requested type. But if I'm looking for a 'menu' of words of a specific type, the models generally produce pretty much what I would on my own with a far greater time commitment.

AI: That's a really practical way to think about it - AI as a time-saving tool that delivers the same quality you'd achieve on your own, just much faster. 

You mentioned that for your terrain carvings, "any creative aspects originate entirely from my mind." When you're working with AI for those business tasks like generating templates or keywords, how do you maintain that sense of creative ownership and control over your overall artistic practice?

User: I've gradually learned the the creative process is something that I allow to happen. As many artists would claim, the source of the creativity is something 'other.' It does not originate inside my own mind, rather my mind is sometimes able to access this stream of energy that exists entirely separate from me. This is generally accomplished through a process of removing all distractions and experiencing the materials, the intent, and the creative energy of any specific project. I've learned not to attempt to force things. If it is meant to be, it will find a way. I maintain control and ownership over my artworks, but I do not have strong feelings about associated content like a product description template. Many modern artists must be concerned with piracy of their material, but reproducing my art is difficult. Each piece I create speaks for itself.

AI: That's a beautiful way to describe the creative process - as accessing something that flows through you rather than something you manufacture. It sounds like there's a real distinction for you between that sacred creative space where you're channeling something larger, and the more mundane business aspects where efficiency tools make sense.

Given this perspective on creativity as something you "allow to happen," what concerns, if any, do you have about AI's growing presence in creative fields more broadly?

User: Artists and creators are rightly concerned with AI-generated art, trained on their creative work, being used to supplant their services. Ultimately, however, I am of the opinion that the actual process of generating 'something new under the sun' is a function of the human mind. AI can only regurgitate and rearrange, though admittedly, human creativity involves these aspects, too.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - acknowledging both the legitimate concerns artists have while also recognizing something fundamentally different about human creativity. You seem to see a distinction between rearranging existing elements versus that process of accessing something genuinely new that you described earlier.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you anticipate it remaining in that supportive, administrative role, or might you explore other ways of integrating it?

User: I envision a practical use of AI in my woodshop. My CNC machine often runs for hours at a time, and the use of sharp metal bits that spin really fast is inherently dangerous. I'd love to have an AI that can monitor the active machine and instantly pause its action if anything non-optimal is detected (sound, vibration, activation of various sensors). This would free up my time and allow some amount of peace of mind knowing that an active carve is being monitored. I could definitely still envision using AI for creative tasks. While I have no intention of involving it directly in the creative generation of art, it could be used as a sounding board for new project ideas, or as AI improves, asking for more help with my website.

AI: That's such a practical and smart application - using AI as an intelligent safety monitor for your CNC machine. It really fits with how you've been thinking about AI as a helpful assistant for the technical and business sides of your work while keeping the creative core entirely yours.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on creativity as something you "allow to happen" rather than force, and how that shapes where you see AI fitting - or not fitting - into your work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that distinction between the sacred creative process and the practical business aspects, along with your thoughtful approach to where AI can genuinely help versus where it falls short, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through your website and give such specific examples from your songwriting experiences. Best of luck with your terrain carvings and future CNC safety innovations!
