Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's start

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use AI too much in my work day. I might use it for emails or reports every now and then

AI: That's helpful to know. When you say you use it for emails or reports "every now and then" - can you walk me through what that looks like? 

For instance, what prompts you to decide to use AI for an email versus writing it yourself?

User: If I need to write a longer email that needs to be in a professional tone, I will often use AI to give me a basic outline

AI: That makes sense. So you're using AI more as a starting point to get that professional structure in place.

What happens after you get that basic outline from AI? Do you typically take it from there and finish the email yourself, or do you continue working with the AI throughout the writing process?

User: I usually take it from there. I will change little things to make it sound more authentic and human

AI: Interesting - you mentioned making it sound "more authentic and human." 

Tell me more about that. What specifically do you find yourself changing to achieve that more authentic feel?

User: Most people I work with know how I communicate so I might take out words or change sentences to make it sound like it is coming from me and not from AI

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - maintaining your own voice so colleagues recognize it's genuinely from you.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Generally anything involving personal information, I will do myself. My company has a strict policy for not using anyone's personal information

AI: That makes complete sense from a privacy and compliance standpoint.

Beyond the personal information restriction, are there other types of work tasks where you think "I'd rather do this myself" even when AI could potentially help? What drives those decisions for you?

User: Short emails and reports I will write myself because I feel it is more work to open an AI to do it

AI: That's a practical consideration - when the effort to use AI outweighs the benefit for smaller tasks.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it something you've figured out on your own?

User: People talk openly about it. We all pretty much use it for the same reasons

AI: That's helpful context - sounds like there's some shared understanding among your team.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When writing a cover letter I found it particularly helpful. It helped me organize all my experiences in a coherent way

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience - having AI help you organize and structure your experiences coherently.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Sometimes I think about losing skills because AI is doing it for me. But I do a lot of writing on my own as well so I feel that helps keep my skills

AI: That's a thoughtful balance - being aware of the potential skill atrophy while actively maintaining your writing through other means.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it more, less, or differently than you do now?

User: I imagine I will use it more as it gets better and better.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining authenticity in your communications and that practical consideration about when the effort to use AI actually outweighs the benefit.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing comes to mind at the moment

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a starting point while maintaining your authentic voice, the practical considerations around effort versus benefit, and how workplace culture shapes AI adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to participate in this interview today!
