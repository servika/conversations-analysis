Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a dance instructor and a choreographer. On a weekly basis, I am coming up with lesson plans for children who are learning tap, jazz, and ballet. The lesson plans need to be specific to those styles, the level of the students, and (at times) the theme of the week. Something else that is very important is that the lesson plans should expand upon each other- skills learned in the previous week should be reviewed and increased in difficulty. Additionally, I create a dance combination for each class and each week. This means that I create a short piece of chorography in each of the styles that are tailored to the students' level, the choreographic style I'm going for, and sometimes other factors such as the time of year. I am developing my own choreography style, which is a slow process. Lastly, over the next few weeks, I am choreographing a few pieces for the Christmas season.

AI: That sounds like such a rich and multifaceted creative practice! Between the lesson planning, the weekly combinations, and developing your own choreographic style, you're constantly creating and adapting your work.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I use AI tools every week to help me build out the basic structure of my classes, including, but not limited to, barre warmups, stretching sessions, across the floor and center exercises, music choices, and integration of practiced steps into choreography. I also like to ask AI to give me ideas for things that I can teach my students about dance history

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI is really woven throughout different aspects of your teaching preparation. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Yes. Recently, I asked AI to come up with a basic lesson plan for jazz courses and then to alter the difficulty level for 3 different age groups. This made me feel much less overwhelmed. Planning so many classes each week takes so much time, which I do not get paid for (I only get paid for in-person instruction). AI has saved me so much time in this area.

AI: That time-saving aspect sounds really significant for your work situation. Tell me more about that feeling of being less overwhelmed - what was it like before you started using AI for lesson planning compared to now?

User: Before, I was spending a lot of time researching different lesson plans for each dance genre and age group. I was finding different dance syllabi on different websites and synthesizing them into ones that I would use for class. This was extrememly time consuming. AI seems to do that for me. Additionally, I am able to edit the lesson plans quickly and easily. For example, I can ask AI to make the combination more difficult or I can ask it to add more content/ time to the across the floor section of class and take it away from the barre section.

AI: That flexibility to quickly adjust and customize sounds incredibly valuable. When you're working with AI to create these lesson plans or modify them, how would you describe that collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions in that process?

User: I'd like to think that I am driving the create decisions. I am very specific in my prompts about what I want as far as style, difficulty level, etc. If I feel that the AI model is getting off track or giving me ideas that are far off from what I am envisioning, I will redirect the model or ask if we can start over.

AI: That sense of maintaining control over the creative direction sounds important to you. What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Because I am feeling less overwhelmed and anxious about the main planning portion of lesson planning, I find that I am more creative. I am able to focus more on small details. Before, I felt like I was throwing something together last minute due to anxiety and  lack of time. AI allows me to explore the possibilities more deeply.

AI: That's such an interesting insight - that by handling the foundational structure, AI actually freed up mental space for you to be more creative with the details. It sounds like it's shifted your focus from just getting something together to really exploring possibilities.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: Dance is an art form that has been practiced since the dawn of time. It is distinctly human. I would hate to see a time where the art of dance becomes too uniform or "cookie cutter" due to the influence and use of AI. I also would hate to see choreographers use it as a crutch rather than a tool.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns about preserving the human essence and individuality in dance. When you think about that line between using AI as a tool versus a crutch, how do you navigate that for yourself? What does that distinction look like in practice?

User: I need to do a better job at navigating it myself. I plan on blocking off time to make lesson plans completely without the help of AI. In the future, I would like to get to a place where I can quickly create a lesson plan/ choreography on my own and only use AI to tweak it

AI: That goal of building your own quick creation skills first makes a lot of sense - almost like developing your foundational muscles before relying on the assistance.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see myself using it more efficiently. Additionally, I would love (and not be surprised) if AI could eventually learn my choreography style and apply that to what it tells me.

AI: That's really intriguing - the idea of AI learning and adapting to your specific artistic voice. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI has freed up mental space for you to focus on the creative details, and your thoughtful approach to maintaining that balance between tool and crutch.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all. Thanks!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI can actually enhance creativity by reducing overwhelm, and your thoughtful concerns about preserving the distinctly human nature of dance, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
