Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good to me!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I've been working with my student on investigating the effects of high pressure processing on acidified broth, designed to mimic fruit juices. We have been looking at the effects of pressure, process time, sample pH, and acidulant on E. coli and Listeria.

AI: That sounds like a fascinating project! Can you tell me more about what that research process looked like from start to finish - from when you first had the idea to investigate these pressure processing effects all the way through to where you are now with the results?

User: I had the idea when I was in grad school, but I didn't get a chance to look into it until I started as a professor. My student worked on the literature review and developing the experimental protocols, and I helped her pick appropriate variables and formulate the research questions and project objectives. We currently have all the results and have performed ANOVA and are starting with model development where we aim to fit a secondary model to explain pH, pressure, and time effects for each microorganism and acidulant combination. We have also collected a set of data on real fruit juices to understand the practical feasibility of applying our data in real-world products.

AI: That's a comprehensive study with multiple phases. Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: Yes, not initially, but when it came time to analyze the data, I started using ChatGPT to help me write some code and get ideas for the secondary models. I mostly used it as a check for my student's work.

AI: Tell me more about how you decided to bring ChatGPT into the data analysis phase. What made you think to try it for writing code and checking your student's work rather than sticking with your traditional approach?

User: I've wanted to learn R for a long time, but I've never had the chance to get a class that would give me the experience I felt I needed. I know Matlab but since it's not open-source, I would need a subscription and I didn't want to rely on that long-term. I figured if I could get the R code through ChatGPT, check it against what my student was doing, and understand how it worked, I'd be starting to learn more of the nuance that I was looking for. Honestly I wouldn't have known how to help my student with her code if something was off without AI tools.

AI: That's really interesting - you used it as both a learning tool and a way to support your student. When you get R code from ChatGPT, how do you go about verifying that it's actually working correctly and producing reliable results for your analysis?

User: I had a gut feeling based on visuals what the results should be. I plotted all of the data first so I sort of knew what to expect. Of course there were some surprises, but that's how research works! I was also able to verify the results against Matlab which was helpful.

AI: That makes sense - using your domain expertise and cross-validation with Matlab as checks. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - the literature review, experimental design, data collection - what's kept you from trying AI tools in those areas?

User: I honestly didn't know much about AI tools in this part of the project, so I didn't use them simply because I didn't have or want access. One of my hesitations is being able to publish my work and ensuring that my work is entirely original. I think if I were to use AI in literature review, I might take an approach of letting it find papers and put together an annotated bibliography. My only worry with that is whether it has found all of the relevant papers and whether the information in the annotations are accurate and relevant to the study so I don't include or exclude things mistakenly. For the experimental design part, I honestly think that is fun, but I am interested in seeing what AI would say and how it can help me think about analysis BEFORE the experiments are done so I don't miss anything important like appropriate controls and ranges of variables.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on the tradeoffs. If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't - or doesn't do well enough for you to trust it - what would that be and why?

User: For me personally, the literature review part I just mentioned. There are soooo many papers out there and I find is difficult and boring to keep up. For society in general, I'd say experimental design and data analysis planning. I have read way too many studies that don't use helpful data analysis techniques and then the data ends up being kind of useless for people like me who develop models.

AI: Those are really insightful points - both about the overwhelming volume of literature and the broader issue with experimental design that could benefit the whole field. 

Those are all my questions, and your perspectives on using AI as a learning bridge to new programming languages and your thoughtful concerns about maintaining research integrity were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think it's necessary that we start thinking about AI as a helpful tool and not a scary thing that helps students cheat. I've seen both sides of the story, but I really want us to get better about understanding and sharing about how we can teach people to use AI to help rather than restrict its use entirely for fear of dishonesty.

AI: Thank you so much for that perspective - that's such an important point about shifting from restriction to education around responsible AI use. Your insights about using AI as a learning bridge for R programming and your careful approach to verification really help us understand the nuances of how AI can fit into real scientific work in productive ways.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly today. If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Your time and thoughtful responses are really valuable to our understanding of how researchers are navigating this evolving landscape.

User: Appreciate the chance to chat! I am closing the conversation.

AI: Thank you so much! It was really great talking with you and learning about your research. Take care!
