Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That all sounds good. Let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: It is quite varied really. I am a writer and will often just work on my own writing projects, usually for screen, although I have also just finished my first novel. I will then try to sell or option these works. Sometimes I am writing full scripts, other time one-sheets or treatments, and other times I will be paid to write a script for someone else rather than creating my own story from scratch. For screenwriting I often work with a writing partner.

AI: That sounds like a really dynamic mix of work - from original novel writing to collaborative screenwriting and everything in between. The variety of formats you work with is interesting too, from full scripts down to treatments and one-sheets.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Sometimes it is just for proofreading or recommending edits, other times it will be for art or design for a one-sheet and other times it will be for research to short cut when I need some obscure or arcane information that would be hard to find without speaking to an expert or that might be overly time consuming for limited benefit.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using AI for those efficiency gains rather than core creative decisions. The research piece is particularly interesting since screenwriting often requires getting those specific details right.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Recently we were preparing a one-sheet for an idea that we had not fully fleshed out. We looked at using AI for design but utilising free tools did not give us the quality we needed. We also asked for a precis of our idea but ended up using that. In the end the only thing we used AI for was to come up with alternatives for a closing sentence that we just couldn't quite get right.

AI: That's a fascinating example - it sounds like you experimented with AI in a few different ways but ultimately found its most valuable contribution was quite targeted. You mentioned you didn't end up using the precis AI generated of your idea.

Tell me more about that - what was it about the AI's summary that didn't work for you?

User: It felt a little rushed and didn't have the right personality for the genre of project. It felt a little lifeless. We have used it before to offer suggestions for a one-pager and foudn the results were great and gave us inspiration for redrafting but in this case, it served a different purpose and made us realise that our current one-sheet synopsis was already working very well.

AI: That's really insightful - so the AI's attempt actually served as a mirror that helped you recognize the strength of what you'd already created. It sounds like there's something about capturing the right tone and personality for specific genres that can be tricky for AI to nail.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I always try to drive creative decisions. For me, I like to use it to hone ideas I have already worked on rather than developing ideas. Where it comes in more useful creatively is asking targeted questions about the reality of a situation - the information I can glean from these conversations might make me approach a scene, a beat or an entire arc differently if I find out my assumptions were correct, and so it can guide creativity in that way, but only as a result of using it to interrogate my own awareness and assumptions.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - using AI to interrogate your assumptions rather than generate the creative core. It sounds like you're maintaining creative authorship while leveraging AI as almost a research partner or sounding board.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Research is the main one. However, during my novel, using it as a copy editor made redrafting far faster. It is hard to be subjective when it is somethine you have written recently, and having a second pair of "eyes" can allow me to more quickly have distance and see things that I would likely have edited with more objective view point but further down the line. It means the second draft can now be the quality that a third draft might have been.

AI: That's a compelling benefit - essentially compressing your editing cycles and getting to higher quality drafts faster. The idea of AI providing that objective distance you'd normally only get with time is really interesting.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have a few. I am not worried about AI but its implementation. I think too many people will start to assume that AI can just take the job of a writer, rather than being a tool that a writer can use to improve their work or streamline the process. It seems that AI is about iteration not creation, and unless we reach the point of AGI, we might end up in a place ingenuity is lost and switched out for faster, cheaper iterative content. The other concern is the flooding of the market. People who are not writers but have a fun idea might suddenly be able to write something that they never would have been able to in the past, meaning suddenly every complany is receiving 100 x more content, and being able to even get read might be tricky.

AI: Those are really thoughtful concerns - the distinction you draw between AI as iteration versus creation is particularly striking. It sounds like you're worried about both a devaluation of the craft itself and a kind of market saturation where genuine writers get lost in the noise.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I hope to keep it much the same. A useful tool I can employ when it is needed, but not too often. I think it is important for me to not reply on it too much, to keep my brain sharp and to make sure I am being as original as I can. I hope to use it to make things look better, to check my figurative homework and to aid me in improving accuracy (through research) and helping me create more by making better use of my time (or perhaos just being able to have a little more time off!)

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - using AI to enhance your capabilities while being intentional about maintaining your creative muscles. The goal of having more time off by being more efficient is refreshingly honest too!

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI being about iteration rather than creation, and how you use it to interrogate your own assumptions rather than generate ideas.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I find it most rewarding using AI when I know it is not affecting anything outside of my usage of it. For instance, I always used to design my own one-sheets. I am not good at design though, so it helps to make these look much better, but it is not taking work from anyone else. With research, I was not employing a researcher, and instead was doing my own research and now I can get there much quicker. So I hope that others might approach utilising AI in the same way - getting better results and making the most of their own time without utilising it to just do away with important jobs (jobs they might not even realise are vital). I think the results will be better that way too, so my hope is it becomes an important tool, but not a replacement for the artists whose ingenuity remains vitally important.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the idea of using AI in spaces where you were already doing the work yourself rather than replacing other people's roles. It sounds like you've found a way to think about AI integration that's both practically beneficial and ethically conscious.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative authorship while leveraging AI as a targeted tool, and your thoughtful approach to where and how you deploy it, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. I really appreciate your candor about both the benefits and the concerns you have about AI in your field.

User: Thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Thanks again for such a thoughtful conversation. Have a great rest of your day!
