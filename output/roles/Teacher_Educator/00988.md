Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a teacher, and I have found many uses for AI in my workday. I use it regularly for generating content, for example passages that include specific spelling and vocab words I want to focus on, exemplar texts at different levels to match grading rubrics, feedback for some student work, worked problems - which is especially helpful when I take classes out of my area, ideas for differentiation, rewording report comments and other communication, matching learning activities to syllabus outcomes, generating specific word lists - for example by spelling pattern or meaning. The list is endless really!

AI: That's a really comprehensive list! It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your teaching practice. 

When you mention taking classes out of your area and using AI for worked problems - can you tell me more about that situation? What was that experience like for you as an educator?

User: My qualification is Primary (K-6), however, I am currently working in a rural area teaching K-12. It is often required to cover classes in areas that are beyond my training, for example more advanced mathematics and science. AI helps me do that more efficiently.

AI: That sounds like a really challenging situation - having to teach outside your area of expertise. 

When you're using AI to help with those advanced mathematics and science classes, how do you approach it? Do you work through the problems with AI step-by-step, or do you have it generate complete solutions that you then review?

User: A bit of both. If I have some notice that I will be covering a class, I will use it to give me a quick overview of content. If I have little notice, or students are working on problems that I am not familiar with, I will use it step-by-step and also to generate complete solutions.

AI: That makes a lot of sense given the unpredictable nature of covering classes. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Even with all these helpful applications you've described, are there certain teaching tasks you prefer to handle yourself - tasks where you could use AI but choose not to? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Reviewing student work is the responsibility of the teacher - no question to me! I prefer to do that myself. However, I have found that suggestions given by AI has improved the quality of my feedback at times. I do like to give examples of student work samples - always deidentified - and check responses against my own feedback. It also really helps uploading some rubrics and having AI generate some responses that match levels of the rubric. Reporting is also a teachers responsibility. It is important that communication to parents about student performance is personalised and written by a teacher who really knows the student. AI does help with wording sometimes, but I strongly believe the content must be generated by the teacher.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making - using AI to enhance your own judgment rather than replace it, especially for those crucial student assessment and parent communication tasks.

When you do use AI to check your feedback against its suggestions or help with wording, can you describe what that process looks like for you? Are you collaborating with it back and forth to refine your approach, or using it more as a one-time check against your own work?

User: It's definitely collaboration to refine my approach. It can be really helpful to identify patterns for content that may need reteaching so asking it to hone in on areas that we have been working on is essential. I would also point out (especially to teachers who see it as a short cut) that AI feedback can be inconsistent. From what I have seen so far, the feedback is for the teacher, not the student.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about the inconsistency and how the feedback is really for you as the teacher rather than direct student feedback.

How have your colleagues or your school's culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you found that working in a rural K-12 setting affects how AI gets discussed or adopted among the teaching staff?

User: I have found people using it for report writing and for generating lesson content. Schools in my area have become more accepting and our education department has developed a model that has been specifically trained on our curriculum. Saying that, there are people who are against it and see all use of AI as cheating - whether by students or teachers.

AI: That's really interesting that your education department developed a curriculum-specific model. It sounds like there's quite a range of attitudes among your colleagues.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I've never really found it frustrating. One one occasion, I generated some exemplar texts for a piece of writing at 6 levels of a rubric that my school was using. The result was excellent. This was particularly satisfying because I was able to show one way it could be used to enhance our work in a way that no one saw as cheating. I have been interested in the applications of AI for some time and have enjoyed sharing how it can be ethically used in our industry.

AI: That sounds like a really meaningful moment - being able to demonstrate ethical AI use to colleagues who might have been skeptical. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given how much you're using it for content generation and planning?

User: I don't see that AI could take over any area in education - only enhance it. The way I use it for planning is for time-saving and personalisation, which I see as critical. I still need to know the curriculum, how students learn, and what suits my students. There have always been resources available to teachers for planning and content, but it has not always been exactly what is needed for any given class or group of students. AI allows teachers to plan and generate content with precision, rather than just find something that is "close enough" to what they need.

AI: That's a really compelling perspective - seeing AI as enabling more precise, personalized teaching rather than replacing teaching skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops or as your school culture continues to adapt?

User: I imagine it will change as technology develops. I couldn't imagine that it would be as useful as it is, so I don't really know what's ahead. School culture could go either way - it could adapt or it could become more resistant. I think that will depend on how people use it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a tool for precision and personalization in teaching, and how you've navigated using it ethically in an environment where some colleagues view any AI use as cheating.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI to enhance rather than replace core teaching responsibilities, and how you've worked to demonstrate ethical applications to colleagues, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
