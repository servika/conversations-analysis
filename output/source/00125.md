Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I'm ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for giving me inspiration when designing new jewellery and helping me write emails/automated messages to customers

AI: That's really interesting - jewelry design and customer communications are quite different applications. 

When you say AI gives you inspiration for jewelry design, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does that process unfold for you?

User: I usually give AI some topics related around jewellery and ask it to give me design ideas or some ideas on how to turn that into jewellery.

AI: Tell me more about that. When you get those design ideas back from AI, what do you do with them? Do they spark something that sends you in a completely different direction, or are you more likely to take the suggestions and build directly on them?

User: Sometimes I will tweak the idea to suit my preferences. Other times I have built directly on them.

AI: That's helpful to understand. Now I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your jewelry work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: Specifically answering questions related to my jewellery from customers I handle myself. This is because I know every detail about the jewellery and how it is made.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you have that deep, hands-on knowledge that comes from creating the pieces yourself. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it a complete request and let it handle things independently?

User: I tend to go back and forth when thinking of creative ideas with AI. For writing emails, I give it a complete request and let it handle things independently.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction between how you work with AI for creative versus communication tasks. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Or since jewelry design can often be quite independent work, how do others in your field or industry talk about using AI?

User: I think most people in my field use AI for administrative tasks, such as a chatbot feature on their website or answering emails etc.

AI: So it sounds like the administrative use is more common in your field. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time I was frustrated was when I was asking AI to visually design a logo for me using concepts I had given it and it was struggling to use all the ideas I had listed.

AI: That sounds frustrating when you had specific concepts in mind but couldn't get them all incorporated. What made that particularly challenging - was it that the AI kept leaving out certain elements, or was it interpreting your concepts differently than you intended?

User: Both, it left out elements and interpreted them differently.

AI: That disconnect between what you envisioned and what came back must have been especially frustrating for creative work. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your jewelry work?

User: I think physically making the jewellery could not be replaced by AI. Even though I use AI to help my write emails, I like to speak to my customers directly still also.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - keeping that hands-on craftsmanship and direct customer connection at the center of what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently or for different things as time goes on?

User: I would like to continue to use AI in administrative tasks as well as seeing how it could help me answering customers emails related to stock for example.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you maintain that personal touch with customers while still leveraging AI for administrative efficiency, and the distinction you make between creative collaboration versus independent task delegation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your jewelry work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing AI assistance with the irreplaceable aspects of craftsmanship and personal customer relationships will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
