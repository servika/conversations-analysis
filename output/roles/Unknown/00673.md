Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, let's start!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Lately I've been using AI to quickly research something, because I find it's a lot faster than sifting through google results. I do always verify that the answer is correct, though. I also will paste in a sentence if I'm not sure about the phrasing or grammar, to get advice on what's correct. I've also used it to generate a contract template and a copyright statement.

AI: That's a helpful overview. I'd like to dig a bit deeper into one of those areas. 

Tell me more about using AI for research - what does that process typically look like for you from start to finish?

User: I'll ask a question, usually just a sentence or two, and I usually get the answer in the first response. Sometimes I'll have a follow-up question or go into more detail about the topic, but often it's just a one-and-done question and answer process.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Anything that requires any measure of creativity, like writing, even if it's just an email response. I find that the way AI writes doesn't sound like me at all, and I can definitely tell when the things people write to me have come from AI, and for some reason I don't appreciate it. It feels like that person isn't trying to genuinely connect with me. I don't want others to have that impression about me, so even though it takes longer, I always compose those things myself.

AI: That's a really interesting perspective about genuine connection. 

Can you tell me more about what it is specifically that tips you off when someone has used AI to write to you? What are those telltale signs you notice?

User: Formatting is a big one; most people don't go to the trouble of doing things like creating headings, bolding key words, etc in a simple email, but AI always does. The tone is quite bland as well, and especially when it comes to people whose writing style and tone I already know, there's a clear difference I can see. I don't know if I can explain exactly how, to be honest--it's just vibes. AI writing has a vibe, and it's different from real people.

AI: That "vibes" description really captures something important. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Can you explain more about what you mean by collaborate through a task? Can you give me an example so I'm clear what you mean?

AI: Sure! By collaborate throughout a task, I mean something like working back and forth with AI on different pieces - maybe you start a draft, then ask AI to help refine a particular section, then you edit that, then ask AI to help with another part, going back and forth. 

Versus delegating a complete task would be more like saying "write me a contract template" and having AI handle the whole thing from start to finish.

Does that help clarify what I'm asking about?

User: Yes, thanks. I definitely tend to do the latter - delegate a complete task, although if it doesn't meet my needs, I'll ask for refinements. My hope though is that it's right the first time, but that's often dependent on whether I give it enough information in the first prompt.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I'm actually a sole proprietor so I don't have colleagues in the sense that I work collaboratively with people. My work is mostly completely independent. I do know people who are in the same line of work with me though, and some of them are very pro-AI for their business and some are quite against it. I can't say I've been influenced one way or another.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I do feel satisfied when it saves me time by doing something quickly that would have taken me awhile (like generating a contract or explaining a nitpicky grammar point, for example). Something that frustrates me is (and this may be specific to ChatGPT) when it always tries to extend the conversation by offering to do things I didn't ask for, to try and draw me into a longer conversation. Another thing that's frustrated me is when AI invents resources or sources instead of just saying it can't find the information I asked for.

AI: That's really insightful about the conversation extension - that sounds quite irritating when you just want a quick answer.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Oh I consider it all the time. I work as a book coach and editor and I can definitely see how my job could be replaced by AI for people who don't appreciate the insight a human can offer. It worries me a lot, actually.

AI: That sounds like a real concern given how directly AI could impact your field.

Tell me more about what you see as the unique insight that you as a human bring to book coaching and editing that's different from what AI offers.

User: I think the human mind has a level of creativity and unique way of looking at problems and coming up with solutions that AI doesn't currently have. It doesn't seem to be able to make connections that a person can easily see or imagine, and when it comes to editing, I don't think it can identify inconsistencies or issues with story the way a person does.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine in the future it will become more integrated into people's daily lives as a sort of always-present personal assistant, something that can manage mundane tasks so I can focus on what I like to do. Getting an intelligent summary of my day ahead every morning as well as suggestions for time management would be useful.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI writing has a distinct "vibe" that affects genuine connection, and your awareness of how AI could impact your field while still seeing potential for it to handle mundane tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between efficiency and authenticity, the telltale signs of AI-generated content, and how you're thinking about the future of your profession will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: No problem. How do I end this interview?

AI: You can simply close this chat window or tab - that will end our interview session. Thanks again for participating!
