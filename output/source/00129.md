Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No question.  I'm ready to begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use generative AI for a few things.  I use the AI tools in Grammarly to help with punctuation and usage, and the occasional idea generation when I'm stuck.  I also use CoPilot and ChatGPT to help me with revisions of content I've created.  The revisions include formatting, creating tables of data, and tailoring written materials for specific audiences  Grammarly also tailors my writing for audiences but I like to use both Grammarly and CoPilot at the same time to help me get the best product possible.  I will occasionally upload data and ask ChatGPT to find strings within the data, but very rarely.

AI: That's a really interesting mix of tools you're using. It sounds like you've developed a thoughtful approach to getting different perspectives on your work.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle creative tasks myself.  I will create a document, for example, and then ask the AI to punch it up for me and the intended audience.  The documents I create have to be factually valid with supporting data, and I prefer to do my own research and initial draft/drafts.  I do not trust AI to not hallucinate and/or fabricate data.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining control over the factual foundation and creative core while leveraging AI for refinement.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: It depends on my satisfaction with the output.  If the first output meets my needs, I am finished.  If I feel that I need more refinement, I will ask the AI to make those refinements.  I do not delegate any tasks to the AI to complete independently.  I treat the AI as an administrative assistant, not a knowledge worker.

AI: That's a really clear distinction - treating AI as an administrative assistant rather than a knowledge worker. It sounds like you maintain oversight throughout the process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My colleagues have influenced me.  I have seen my colleagues misuse AI and suffer consequences, so I learned early that I need to validate output and consider where and how I can best leverage the technology.

AI: That's valuable insight - learning from observing others' experiences. It sounds like those observations shaped your more cautious approach.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was having trouble visualizing some data.  I tried various formats in spreadsheet software and I was not happy with the results.  I fed the data to ChatGPT and asked for a formatted output that demonstrated my hypothesis and it took only two iterations for me to get output that I was satisfied with.  I am not very good at presentation formatting and data presentation, so the AI was helpful.

AI: That sounds like a great example of AI helping you overcome a specific skill gap to achieve your goal efficiently.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I hold an executive position and have to respond to constituent feedback, including sentiment as well as facts.  I don't believe AI, at least, not in the near term, will be able to understand the nuances of a constituency and shape policy to meet that constituency's needs.  AI will always be like a staff member to me, so my staff my need to upskill, but I don't believe I need to upskill.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on how your role requires human judgment that goes beyond what AI can currently provide.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I can see a future where AI could replace some of my staff's functions.  Actively monitoring machine logs, preparing reports, chatbots.  Any tasks that would require only an entry-level employee are likely candidates for AI to assume.  I can see a future where my help desk intake function could be completely turned over to AI, for example, but not all of the troubleshooting and service delivery functions.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on treating AI as an administrative assistant rather than a knowledge worker, and how observing your colleagues' experiences shaped your approach.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nothing comes to mind.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining oversight, the importance of validating AI output, and how you've strategically positioned AI as a support tool rather than a replacement for human judgment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
