Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: my most recent research project is about a diet app that takes in user's info such as their daily meals, comorbidities, sleep pattern and activity levels. Then it uses machine learning to predict the ideal amount of daily calories based on the user's info. i initially started it as an implementation project that only compares the calories with standard values but then i realized that a diet has to consider a person's comorbidities and activity levels.

AI: That's a really interesting evolution from a straightforward calorie comparison to something much more personalized and medically-informed. 

Can you tell me more about what that research process looked like day-to-day? How did you go from that initial implementation idea to developing the machine learning approach that factors in all these different health variables?

User: i initially built an app that takes in manual input from the users and saves it in a database. I also imported data from food databases and used those values to compare them to the user's input. I noticed a lot of irregularities and upon further research i discovered that exercise and metabolism significantly affects the results so i decided to take into account too. I started collecting info about the user's daily exercise and sleep. Then i decided to train a classification model on the info and predict the optimal calories

AI: That's a really thoughtful progression - you let the data and irregularities guide you toward a more sophisticated approach. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools? I'm curious about both the technical development side and any other parts of your research workflow.

User: i used FastAPI and React to build the app that takes in manual data. I used ChatGPT and PyTorch to build a classification model, replace missing values and also generate basic code saving me a lot of time. I also used it for matching the exercise data with the food log.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI became quite integral to several parts of your development process. 

For the classification model work specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use ChatGPT versus figuring things out through your traditional approach. What made you reach for that tool in those moments?

User: I decided to use chatgpt because it saved me a lot of time generating simple code. Although it could not go into depth, it did provide me enough to reduce the time taken for a simple task. if the problem was a bit more complicated that needed attention from me, I used the traditional approach

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as a time-saver for the more straightforward coding tasks while handling the complex problem-solving yourself.

Thinking about the parts of your research where you haven't used AI - like perhaps the deeper analytical work or specific domain expertise around nutrition and comorbidities - what's kept you from trying it there?

User: I feel like i could not trust AI judgement on the analytic work because i wanted to be really sure about the final result. I preferred to be in control of the error analysis and comorbidity research

AI: That's a really important distinction you're making about control and trust, especially when it comes to health-related outcomes.

When you did use ChatGPT for the classification model and code generation, how did you verify or validate what it produced? What was your process for making sure those outputs were reliable?

User: i read and debugged the code instead of copy pasting it entirely. I also used logistic regression in scikit to compare the PyTorch model

AI: That's a smart validation approach - using both manual review and comparison with established methods. We're about halfway through our conversation now.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: i would really appreciate if AI could conduct deep analysis. At the moment, i feel hesitant to trust AI with analysis so I just use it to generate simple code and models. It might take a while for AI to reach human-level personal analysis but it would definitely help a lot.

AI: That's really insightful - you're identifying this gap between where AI is useful now versus where you'd need it to be for the deeper analytical work that requires your domain expertise and judgment.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI as a productivity tool while maintaining control over the critical analytical decisions were particularly valuable. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between leveraging AI for efficiency while maintaining personal control over critical health-related analysis really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. 

It's clear you've developed a thoughtful approach to integrating these tools where they add value while recognizing the boundaries of where human expertise remains essential, especially in domains with real-world health implications.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
