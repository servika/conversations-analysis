**Transcript ID:** AI: I see - so when you say ""vibe coding

---

" you're essentially showing the AI the symptoms and letting it diagnose and fix the problem rather than you diving deep into understanding the root cause yourself.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I typically find finalizing emails, UI/UX design, and innovative ideation to be something that I do myself, but anything related to advising, strategy, code, I typically trust AI. Sometimes it may take a few prompts to fix an error due to poor prompting or the Ai just making errors, but most of the time I find it pretty reliant.

AI: That's interesting - you keep the creative and final decision-making tasks like UI/UX design and innovative ideation to yourself, but trust AI with more analytical tasks like strategy and coding.

When you do use AI for strategy and advising, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout developing a strategy, or do you tend to give it the full context and let it handle the strategic thinking independently?

User: When I ask AI about strategy and advising I have my own plan/idea set up, but I prompt the AI with simply the context and have it think independently to see what it comes up with and to see if it's better than my idea. If it fails, I follow up with my idea and see how it can further innovate/expand on it.

AI: So you're essentially using AI as a strategic sounding board - testing your ideas against an independent perspective before refining them further. That's a really thoughtful approach.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has working in a tech startup environment shaped how you approach these tools?

User: Typically the people within my team adapted to use AI like how I do, however we've all developed and saved prompts that work for different scenarios and how to approach the AI when it comes to things like coding, asking for strategy/advise, image generation, etc.

AI: That's smart - developing a shared library of effective prompts as a team. It sounds like you've all collectively learned how to get better results from AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There have been a lot of moments where I was satisfied with AI - especially within frontend development and simple backend tasks for coding. However, I found that having the AI write up simple elevator pitches that are fine tuned to a specific incubator be very poor. It trends away from our company's purpose and goes on to hallucinate or write poor elevator pitches/simple, tailored paragraphs, it always sounds robotic or needs refinement.

AI: That's a really telling contrast - AI excels at the technical coding tasks but struggles with the nuanced, company-specific communication that needs to capture your unique voice and purpose.

When those elevator pitches come back sounding robotic or off-brand, what do you think is missing? Is it something about how AI handles that kind of personalized, strategic communication?

User: It's more so about staying on track with the company mission and not having the balance between formality and impactful statements.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like AI struggles to hit that sweet spot where you're being professional but also compelling, while staying true to what makes your company unique.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: As a young student I've adapted to use AI to learn subjects and grow with it, so I don't really worry about it taking over my skillset, but more so how I can develop with it and become more efficient.

AI: That's a really mature perspective - viewing AI as a tool for accelerated learning rather than a threat to your skills.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this partnership heading?

User: I see my relationship evolving as I learn how to integrate it more and more throughout my business where it can do equally as well as I would or outperform my skillset in a certain task. My goal is to essentially have the best output with minimal effort.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on using AI as a strategic sounding board to test your own ideas, and how you've developed that collaborative workflow with your team around effective prompting.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI across different aspects of running your startup - from technical development to strategic planning - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to understand how you've developed such a systematic approach to working with AI, especially your method of testing AI's independent thinking against your own ideas. Thanks again!
