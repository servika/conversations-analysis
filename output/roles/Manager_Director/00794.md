Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I am ready!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, I am in quite a few different roles. I first started with Licensing Management, and I had to learn very quickly how to manipulate a lot of data in a short amount of time, that follows certain templates for each brand. This is really time consuming, but wasn't so bad in the beginning because my role was on the smaller side. Fast forward to today, and I work cross departmentally with shipping/logistics teams, product development, sourcing, and project/program management, as well as my licensing role (we now have 20+ licensors and growing!). I also use PLM software, such as WFX, and Asana. 
Within my day to day, I use AI for organizational tasks, brainstorming, data manipulation and analysis, reading really difficult shipping and logistics documents, and research based questions. I also use AI to read through many legal-heavy contracts in my licensing role. I also ask AI to help me source vendors, create emails for buyers, and understand different and new terms that I am not well versed in.

AI: That's quite a diverse set of responsibilities! It sounds like AI has become integrated across many different aspects of your work.

Tell me more about the data manipulation part - what does that process typically look like when you're working with AI on those licensing templates?

User: We have to create royalty reports and while pivot tables and vlook up and different functions are helpful, some of the reports are hundreds or thousands of lines large. Trying to organize and manipulate the data or double checking all of this is really time consuming. Typically I will either ask AI how to manipulate the data, or if it can format the information for me to follow the licensor's template that they require. There is some sensitive information in there (contract numbers / names) so I try to avoid giving this information out, but mostly it is trying to read through the data and organizing it  in a way that fits the templates I have to plug everything in to

AI: That makes sense - working with those large datasets while being mindful of sensitive information. 

When you're dealing with these royalty reports, do you find yourself collaborating with AI step-by-step through the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: It varies in some cases. When there are datasets that are straightforward, I prefer to give it a task to take care of independently, however, it doesn't always get it right. Other times, I run into issues and will have to work with the AI model over many steps in order for it to get what I need correctly.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you've developed a sense of when to expect AI to handle something on its own versus when you'll need that back-and-forth collaboration.

Can you walk me through what happens when it doesn't get it right? What does that process look like when you have to work through those multiple steps together?

User: I really try to be very thorough and straightforward in my explanations when I know it will need some finessing with the model to get what I need. For example, if I am working on a report and I need to figure out a way to minimize my workflow, I will provide screen shots of what I am currently doing and ask it to walk me through a guide of how to get what I need in a more efficient way. 
Sometimes it doesn't get it right right away and I have to try the next day with a different approach

AI: That's a practical approach - using screenshots and being very detailed in your explanations. 

You mentioned sometimes having to try again the next day with a different approach. What's going through your mind during those moments when AI isn't quite getting what you need? How does that feel when you're working against deadlines with those royalty reports?

User: Well, it is frustrating at times. Sometimes it fails to read the dataset and then I have to just google it on my own but this takes a lot of time, or I resort to just doing it the old fashioned way. If i am able to get it to help successfully, even the next day, then the small delay or back and forth is worth it. I really just prefer to give it the licensor template and all of the data and say "Here - put this data into this template." Automating that kind of work can get tricky, though, and that fear is two-fold. 1 - it means my job will be less important since there is something else that can do it more efficiently and quicker. 2 - there will be more room for error and either I have to double check it or, I won't be there to double check it. If you get my drift lol

AI: I definitely get your drift! That tension between wanting the efficiency gains but also having concerns about accuracy and job security sounds like something you're actively navigating.

Tell me more about that balance - how do you decide when it's worth the risk of potential errors versus just doing it the traditional way yourself?

User: Yes!
Well it depends on the report. If it is on the smaller side and I know I can easily double check it, I will take the risk. If it is a larger report and it comes out with a wildly strange format or number, then I will take the time to do it myself. Also, it depends on the time I have - if it is early on in the quarter and have a little less on my plate, I will give the AI a chance and have the time to step in if I need to. If I don't need to step in, then it's a win.

AI: That's a smart strategy - weighing the size, your available time, and how easily you can verify the results.

I'm curious about your colleagues or workplace culture. How have they influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your company using it similarly, or are you more of a pioneer in this area?

User: I think a lot of other people use AI quite often actually. I know my COO uses it to write emails, specifically for when a new person is brought on, or someone has a new role. Her emails are always formatted the same (random bold face like the AI would do to emphasize something) and they always have a similar voice - but not hers. More like, a more polished/formal voice that still is hers, but for someone who uses AI so often in my work, I can tell it isn't written by her lol. 
I know other colleagues use AI to generate images. They use to not only generate, but also edit their images instead of going through Photoshop to blur or clean up the background on something. I also think our marketing team uses AI for marketing copy, but am not 100% sure, but definitely know it's a huge possibility. Oh! And in the marketing team, one of my colleagues created an AI generated video of our t-shirt being worn (I work in apparel).

AI: It sounds like AI use is pretty widespread across your company, even if people don't always talk about it openly. You seem to have developed a good eye for spotting AI-generated content!

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Oh for sure - just today, I experienced both. I am working on some goods coming in and received a customs document (I think it is called the 7501 HTS doc or something) and it is really difficult to read for someone who is not well versed in shipping or logistics or customs. I needed it to read it for me and understand where the figures were coming from. I was able to get clarity on that part, but then a follow up question completely confused it and had to exit and move on to something else. I think I asked it something about a BOL attached to that document and confirming if something was received. It was totally confused and I ended up having to dig around and research more about the BOL to confirm receipt.

AI: That's a perfect example of both sides of the AI experience! It sounds like you got real value from having it decode that complex customs document, but then hit a wall when you needed to connect different pieces of information.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Oh for sure - I do not want my skills to go by the wayside, even if AI is taking that part over. I feel as though a human connection and the human eye are invaluable and that goes for the skills as well.

AI: That human perspective clearly matters a lot to you. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as both the technology and your comfort with it continue to develop?

User: Definitely!! I want to be able to grow in my role(s) and using AI will definitely help me get there and continuously help me learn and grow even more and evolve into something different, I think. I think learning is a necessary part of life, and it is super important to be open to all of that - never stop learning. Just because something got easy doesn't mean we should quit - so if AI is doing the heavy lifting, it doesn't mean I can throw in the towel and take a back seat.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on growth and continuous learning. You've shared some fascinating insights about balancing efficiency with accuracy, maintaining your skills while leveraging AI's capabilities, and navigating this across such a diverse set of responsibilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet that feels important to your day-to-day experience?

User: No, I don't think so!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. I found your perspective on navigating the balance between efficiency and accuracy particularly insightful, along with how you've developed strategies for when to collaborate step-by-step versus when to delegate complete tasks.

Your insights about maintaining human skills while embracing AI's capabilities, and how you're thinking about growth in this evolving landscape, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Thanks again for your time - this has been a really valuable conversation!
