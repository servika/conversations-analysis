Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, I have no questions!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a full time wedding photographer so I use many tools to help me in the various stages of my projects. With my clients, I typically help plan some of their wedding details and do correspondance, which I use AI to help with. Creatively, I get to use AI in a lot of my marketing - like creating content for social media or blogs for my website - and in the post-production process of selecting, editing, and delivering the client's wedding photos.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI touches multiple stages of your workflow, from client communication all the way through to final delivery. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: My job is naturally quite creative since not only it deals with the art of photography, but as an entrepreneur I feel my approach to "doing business" is creative. I find I use AI most when I am brainstorming, iterating ideas, trying to communicate to associates and clients, create effective and passive workflows, and especially with marketing. I like to have conversations frequently where I state my objective or intended outcome and then have the AI ask me questions, gain deep knowledge understanding about my approach or perspective, and then help me create the path to obtain my objective. For example, when using AI for creating Instagram content, I will first extensively train the AI on my tone of voice, brand values, mission, objectives, workflows, and more. I typically will say something like "I need you to help me create my Instagram content for my wedding photography business. I'm trying to reach (this type of person) and get them to (do this thing like book a wedding package). Here's what I want my content to look like or sound like. Here are some difficulties I face." And then before I let it help me, I tell it to ask me questions to gain better understanding from me of what it may need to accomplish the task. I will do this with other things - such as creating a new client experience or package. Sometimes I will do a similar approach to help me practice sales calls or create a new script.  Really the possibilities here are endless.

I also will use it to edit copy on my website, or to review the copy I have and tell me if it's in a good order for the "customer journey" and ask if there's something I can change to have more impact. I like to think of all AI use as a collaboration. I provide the intended outcome and have the AI help me better define that outcome and the supporting details. Then I provide the initial idea or the draft version and then use the AI to help me see my "blind spots". I iterate my thoughts about the blind spots it pointed out and then it helps me come up with solutions. I will spend extensive amounts of time on many tasks using AI and think it has improved my quality of output in every way and arena of business. 

I also use tools that are AI powered, but not the typical "chat bot" AI. I use programs that will AI select a desired amount of images from 10k images from a wedding for example based on certain qualities I'm looking for. It will select the best of the images, include one of every grouping from family photos, omit everything that has closed eye, or follow the other instructions  given. I use a program that will auto edit all of my images to a certain style that is trained based on my past images. I have a program that delivers the images AI sorted by individual in the images. The longer I think about it the more uses I realize I use AI for.

AI: That's incredibly detailed - thank you for painting such a clear picture of how deeply integrated AI has become across your entire business. I can really hear the collaborative approach you've developed.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I am in the process of extending my business to include "Lifestyle Photography" which is like family photos. Instead of just integrating it into the current business I have I decided it needs to be it's own standalone thing - really so that my wedding business doesn't become in-cohesive and watered down. In the earliest stages I think AI helped me come to this conclusion when I was confused about how to fuse the two together. But this overhaul that I'm still currently in has required that I look through every corner of my business and convert my business assets (like pdf guides, onboarding documents, contracts, website copy, portfolio blogs, sales scripts) into a version that communicates my lifestyle photography objectives and services. Some of that has been more administrative and editorial in nature, but overall I "outsource" a lot of the decision brainstorming and idea creation to AI because it's an overwhelming and idea-heavy process. Since I train my AI chats with things like my mission statement or values or desired outcome, when I present an idea or problem I find that it will consider the impact to that "bigger vision" more easily and consistently than I do. When it knows in such detail my entire business or even just my client experience, I find that when I do even really quick chats like "how should I respond to this email" it gives a very well considered and thorough answer. But this use of AI for the "creation" stages of things provides me so much more freedom to pursue the best ideas well and abandon the not so great ones early.

AI: That's a really compelling example - it sounds like AI has become almost like a strategic business partner that helps you maintain consistency with your bigger vision while navigating complex decisions.

When you're working with AI in these situations, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I think I like to think of myself as the decider or CEO in this example, and think of that AI as the "collector" or researcher or well of information. As mentioned, I typically begin with my objective. Even a simple weekly task of writing up all my Instagram captions for the week, I will know what I want them to push towards or "sell" and so my collaboration with the AI is asking it to provide me a wealth of ideas of topics that I can then pare down and dive deeper every step with. Once I narrow down to one topic for a caption, for example, then the new objective is to write that caption, and first I need a hook...so I go to the AI and ask for a wealth of ideas of hooks that would capture the reader. This process just continues until I feel like I like where we've landed. I frequently find myself saying things like "no I don't like any of these ideas. Let's try something that (is more educational, or more emotionally driven for example)..." and then steer the direction a bit to get ideas closer to what my original vision was. I find it is one of the most valuable things to help me ideate, test, and come to decisions quickly, but keeping myself in creative control is essential with my work.

AI: That's such a clear dynamic - you as the CEO setting direction and the AI as this expansive research partner helping you explore possibilities within your vision. It really sounds like you've found a way to maintain your creative authority while leveraging AI's ability to generate options.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Definitely the amount of time I spend on these tasks has been reduced. Sometimes I feel that it is reduced, but then the AI provides me with such great and clear ideas that I am able to execute them significantly better. The quality of my ideas has gone up, my decisions are more decisive because often I've been walked through many potential "outcomes" or ideas and so my confidence is higher, and I know for sure the output is improved. The use of the AI tools in my post process with culling and editing my images has cut my turnaround time on galleries from 12 weeks to about 3! And when I provide better marketing materials, a better client experience, faster service, etc. then I am able to charge more, so I know I've been making significantly more money. I do feel that one downside is the sheer amount of ideas I run through - it can give me a sense of shiny-object syndrome and if not kept in check it can run me a bit crazy and feeling like there's always something new to chase. I've had to become much more intentional about what I take on and how it will promote my long-term objectives.

AI: That's such an honest reflection - the dramatic improvements in turnaround time and quality, but also that challenge of managing the overwhelming flow of possibilities. It sounds like AI has almost amplified your creative potential but required you to develop new discipline around focus.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I worry that relying on it too much in regards to creative steps will remove me from the drivers seat. I avoided using AI for my photo editing for a very long time thinking that was too big of a "part" of what I do to outsource it, that the creative reflection of "me" would no longer be in my work. I personally found a workflow that leans on AI to do the bulk of the work early on, so that I am less crunched for time and have more freedom to revisit the gallery with my own eyes, intentionally making edits and tweaks that I may have missed before or not had time for. So in a sense, I am more removed from the "busy work" of editing like exposing or fixing skin tones, and I am more free to let the creative pieces be tended to intentionally - like crop or adding in depth of shadows, or removing distractions. I think there's hardly any downside on my end for using it in an administrative sense, to draft or template email responses, or to think of the workflows that are more thorough to fit the experience I want a client to have, but on the creative side I have to carefully watch how far removed I become from the heart of my work and to consider what impact that is having on my work.

AI: That's such a thoughtful distinction you've made - using AI to handle the technical busy work so you can focus more intentionally on the truly creative decisions. It sounds like you've found a way to let AI enhance rather than replace your creative voice.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see the photography industry embracing AI more as a "whole." I know in my circles I am one of the few that really embrace these tools and even just the use of AI bots in every day to alleviate the brain fog of general business ownership. I'm excited to see what special AI powered tools may be created. The ones I use now have objectively been the best thing to improve my output, time spent, earning power, etc. But I do worry that with mass acceptance there will be the risk that AI is used more - but not more intentionally. I do not want to fall into that trap. I also see there being a limit to the growth or adoption I can have of these tools because of my standard or guardrails protecting my creative ownership. As I scale my business I think it will help more with administrative stuff. I never ever see myself abandoning the tools I use now, so it can only go "up" from here, but I do wonder how much more. I do find new ways every day to use it, so I'm sure I will continue to explore and invest in these options. I think it will be embraced as photographers dabble in it and realize that if done right you really can still protect and keep your creative ownership and direction.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative ownership while leveraging AI as a strategic partner, and how you've developed such intentional guardrails to stay in the driver's seat.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between efficiency and creative control, and how you've developed such a thoughtful, intentional approach to AI collaboration, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candidly you shared both the tremendous benefits you've experienced - like cutting your turnaround time from 12 weeks to 3 - as well as the challenges of managing that "shiny object syndrome" and staying focused on your long-term vision. Your approach to using AI as a strategic research partner while maintaining yourself as the CEO making the creative decisions is a fascinating model.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your lifestyle photography expansion!
