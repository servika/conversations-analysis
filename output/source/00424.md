Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine. I'm ready to get started.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical workday, we turn to ChatGPT for using software more effectively.

AI: Tell me more about that. What does using software more effectively look like in practice?

User: In practice, our team was told to scrape data from LinkedIn, using a scraping tool and Sales Navigator. Searching Sales Navigator for the specific criteria the company requires can be tricky. We turned to ChatGPT to get boolean strings and better tips on how to construct our searches.

AI: That's interesting - so ChatGPT helps you craft better search strategies. When you're working on these data scraping tasks, do you find yourself going back and forth with ChatGPT to refine the search criteria, or do you typically get what you need from it in one go?

User: Well, it's interesting. This happened recently. One team member got some search strategies, and we started using that. However, this helped a little but not enough. Another team member went in with different questions to help refine the search. That helped. Later I went in with another conversation and came up with an even better strategy that finally refined the search closer to where I needed it, with more relevant results and less manual filtering required.

AI: That's a fascinating progression - it sounds like each person approached the problem from a different angle and built on what came before. What was different about the approach or questions you used that helped you get closer to the results you needed?

User: I didn't have access to the other team member's conversations, just the actionable results they shared. My approach may have been a little different because I'm more familiar with AI and prompting. Or perhaps it was that I simply approached the task with different questions innately.

AI: What kinds of questions did you find yourself asking that you think made the difference? Can you walk me through your approach?

User: Well, my first step was to enter a jumbled and combined list of job titles, and have them properly extrapolated. This helped to clean and organize the data before proceeding with formulating a strategy for the search query.

AI: That's a smart preprocessing step. So you had ChatGPT help organize the job titles first before tackling the search strategy itself. What happened next - how did you move from that organized list to creating the actual search query?

User: From there it was simple. The AI already had the job titles, and I asked an open-ended question to help figure out how to best target these roles in LinkedIn Sales Navigator given an institution is specified. From here, the answer gave us a new strategy that we hadn't tried before, which should have been in use already.

AI: What was that new strategy that emerged? It sounds like it was something that felt obvious in hindsight but hadn't occurred to your team before.

User: Well, we had been using boolean strings in the job title filter, but my query gave us the strategy of combine with discipline keywords in a keyword filter. So we layered a boolean string into the keywords filter, using keywords the AI had extrapolated from the various job titles in my first query. It helped a lot, and we were surprised we hadn't been layering the keyword filter with the other filters.

AI: That layering approach sounds like it made a real difference. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Not really. If AI could help with the tasks, I appreciate the help. However we don't use AI formally for tasks, more informally for this type of brainstorming and problem-solving.

AI: That's interesting - so you use it more as an informal thinking partner than for formal task completion. When you're using AI for this kind of brainstorming and problem-solving, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout working on something, or do you tend to get what you need and then work independently?

User: I would get what I need - information, strategy, a boolean string, and then work independently.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? It sounds like your team has found a collaborative approach even though you each work with AI individually.

User: Yes, my team is a small group and we are pretty independent. When my team leader mentioned that my teammate had found the original strategy with ChatGPT, it encouraged me to openly use it and talk about it.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: When using AI to strategize Sales Navigator searches, I felt particularly satisfied when I was able to come up with an overlooked and effective solution. When I shared it with my team leader, she was very happy about it, and that was also satisfying.

AI: That sounds like a really positive moment - both solving the problem and having your contribution recognized. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Looking ahead, if given the opportunity, I will bring AI more into my role. Using agents and automation would be a better way to handle this data scraping kind of work.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that iterative team approach where each person brought different questions and perspectives to get progressively better results.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as an informal brainstorming partner and how different team members can build on each other's AI interactions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
