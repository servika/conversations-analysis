Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you?

User: yes

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I like to use it to help me with brainstorming ideas and writing things like headlines. Also looking up facts that I then fact check myself elsewhere

AI: That's interesting - you mention brainstorming, writing headlines, and fact-checking. 

Can you walk me through what a typical brainstorming session with AI looks like for you? How do those conversations usually unfold?

User: If I'm stuck thinking up ideas for article idea, I'll ask an AI to come up with 5 ideas about X topic. I'll then focus in on ones that I'm interested in and then ask the AI to give me some angles. Then see what comes up. I'll also try to get a few outlines of flow. Get some ideas of people to interview, what sort of quotes would work for the angle. Mostly the AI is used as a idea generator and soundboard to get the bones of an article which I then would go off and do the writing myself.

AI: That sounds like a really structured approach. You're essentially using AI to build the framework, then taking over the actual execution.

When you're in that back-and-forth with AI - asking for angles, then outlines, then interview suggestions - how do you decide when you've gotten enough from the AI and it's time for you to take over?

User: When I can then have a strong idea of how the article is going to be structured, what elements I need for it, then I don't need the AI anymore

AI: That makes sense - so it's about reaching that clarity point where you have your roadmap.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you do the actual writing yourself - are there other tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: In terms of work, that's pretty much it. I think of AI as a tool, like an assistant but it can't do everything like the writing. I guess if it could call people or video people to interview them, transcribe it, pull out the best quotes, and tell me in the timecode where to find it. That would be helpful

AI: So you see AI as having clear boundaries - helpful for certain preparatory work, but not for the core creative and human-connection parts of journalism.

When you're using AI for those brainstorming sessions or fact-checking, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it specific chunks to handle on its own?

User: Well like I said, after I get the idea and framework, sometimes I use it to get facts, but then I would have to make sure the facts are correct myself. So yes sometimes throughout the task but mostly just for fact finding

AI: Got it - so you're checking back in with AI periodically during your research phase, but mainly for specific factual questions.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you talk about AI use with your coworkers, or is it more of an individual decision?

User: It's something that's not really talked about. But you can tell when people are using it and not doing their own writing

AI: That's a really telling observation. It sounds like there's an unspoken awareness about AI use in your workplace.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I can't think of specific areas, but it is helpful for the idea creation. Sometimes in general it gets frustrating when some of the words and things sound similar

AI: You mentioned noticing similar-sounding words and language patterns - that's an interesting frustration.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Well it's pretty obvious when AI is writing something so I think for now human writers are safe

AI: That confidence in being able to distinguish AI writing is interesting - you seem to feel secure about the value of human writing.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing from how you use it now?

User: Like I said, if AI can do more of the gruntwork like finding sources, interviews, and doing the physical work of doing that, I don't see it changing it much

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a preparatory tool that helps you build the framework before you take over the creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a structured brainstorming partner and the unspoken awareness of AI use in newsrooms will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
