Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I have no questions.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to write emails to customers and also to summize some of the invoices I need to pay.  I like to ask AI to give me innovative marketing ideas for advertising campaigns.  I also use it to help me organize my schedule and prioritize my tasks.

AI: That's a nice range of uses across different parts of your work. Tell me more about how you use AI for writing emails to customers - what does that process look like for you?

User: At this point in time, I still like to be somewhat in control as to what I write to the customer so I give AI an outline of the points I want to make with brief ideas.  I then ask AI to write the email using a business-like but friendly tone and to put the points I wish to make in a logical sequence that flows well and is easy for the customer to understand.

AI: That's really interesting how you maintain that level of control over the content while letting AI handle the structure and tone. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I do prefer the handle my bookkeeping and invoicing tasks by myself.  As an accountant, I am a stickler for accuracy in my accounts and so I have not yet developed enough trust in AI to let it take over that that task.  I would prefer to verify accuracy of the balances due and not have to deal with sending out an incorrect billing as that does not go over well with the customer.

AI: That makes complete sense - accuracy in billing is crucial for maintaining customer relationships. It sounds like trust and the potential consequences of errors really influence which tasks you're comfortable delegating.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: At this point in time, I prefer to take a collaborative approach.  Again, that has more to do with me being a stickler for accuracy and being somewhat unwilling to hand total control to AI.  I will ask the AI to complete a task but then I will verify the accuracy if its work myself.

AI: I can see that verification step is really important to you across different types of tasks. It sounds like you've developed a consistent workflow where you maintain oversight.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We have a small business for which I am the business manager and accountant.  My colleagues are not involved in the AI process at this time, but in the future that may change since I hope to start using AI to create the work schedule.

AI: That's interesting that you're essentially pioneering AI use in your organization. When you mentioned creating work schedules with AI in the future, that sounds like it would involve your colleagues directly.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I find AI to be very satisfying when performing tasks like writing emails because it does that very well.  That saves me a lot of time which I can then spend doing more important tasks.   I have had some frustrations with AI when I tried to have it set up a marketing plan and it went completely off course with ideas that did not match what I had requested.

AI: That contrast is really telling - the email writing works smoothly, but the marketing plan went off track. Tell me more about what happened with that marketing plan - what did you ask for and how did it miss the mark?

User: I asked for a plan that would be suitable for reaching customers with older vehicles, since we are not a dealership and therefore our customers are those who own cars that are no longer under warranty.  AI was determined to focus on new or almost new cars that do not fit our business model.

AI: That's a perfect example of how context really matters - AI missing that crucial detail about your specific customer base completely changed the usefulness of the output. It sounds like it didn't grasp the fundamental difference in your business model.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It would be wonderful if AI could take over more of my tasks, including those that require more skill.  That said, I would still prefer to be involved in overseeing what AI did before giving it the stamp of approval.  I see myself as always proofreading the work that AI does.

AI: So you're open to AI handling more complex work, but you see yourself maintaining that oversight role as essential. It sounds like you envision a future where your role shifts more toward quality control and verification.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Ideally, I see AI as taking over more of my tasks as it continues to evolve in its capacity.  That said, I still see myself overseeing accuracy and quality.  But I can definitely save time by having AI do the work with verification being all that is required of myself.  I think, in time, I could come to trust AI more as its accuracy and understanding of my systems grows.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective on how trust might develop over time as you see AI's accuracy improve with your specific systems.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful thoughts about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described that balance between wanting efficiency gains while maintaining your quality standards - and how trust plays such a central role in determining which tasks you're comfortable delegating.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered everything, thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining oversight while gradually building trust with AI, and how the stakes of different tasks influence your comfort level, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: You are most welcome and thank you.

AI: You're very welcome! Have a great rest of your day.
