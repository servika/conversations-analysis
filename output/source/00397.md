Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions to begin

AI: Perfect, let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use AI as a knowledge base to better understand topics that I am working on. If I run into problems with code or need to quickly learn how to use an external library I might use an AI model to help with that.

AI: That's really interesting - using AI as a knowledge resource for learning and problem-solving. 

Can you walk me through what that looks like when you hit a coding problem? How do you typically interact with the AI to work through it?

User: I would typically describe the issue or share an error message that I received. This is to keep what I am working on confidential.

AI: That makes sense - being mindful of confidentiality while still getting the help you need.

When you describe the issue or share an error message, what happens next in that interaction? Do you find yourself going back and forth with follow-up questions, or does it usually give you what you need in one response?

User: Sometimes I get what I need with a single response, sometimes I'll need to go back and forth if I'm not able to share enough information. Sometimes that back and forth is a better approach because it gives me a deeper understanding of the error and might give me additional ideas to further improve my work.

AI: That's a great insight - that the back and forth process itself can be valuable for deepening your understanding, not just solving the immediate problem.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I mostly handle data intensive tasks myself because they can contain sensitive data. Failing to protect this data can result in server ramifications, not only for me but the company and customers which can be affected. In addition to this there is some automation that I prefer to build out myself because I have a good idea of where a project might be developing towards and I can build the ecosystem that is needed now with additional features which can be used later. Also these automated scripts and environments can be more resource and computationally friends because it is built for this specific use case.

AI: That's really thoughtful - you're weighing both security considerations and long-term project needs when deciding what to handle yourself.

When you mention building automation with future development in mind, can you tell me more about that thought process? How do you balance getting something working now versus setting it up for those future features?

User: Getting something to work now with plans to expand on it in the future requires knowing how to break down different components of your system for reuse. If I have an idea of what future developments are needed or will come in the future, I know what overlap will exist. By knowing the overlap I can breakdown scripts in such a way that when the new feature is added, I can reuse existing features with new parameters easily build new features in the automation.

AI: That's a sophisticated approach to system design - thinking about modularity and reusability from the start. It sounds like you have a clear mental model of how to architect these systems for future expansion.

When you use AI for work, you mentioned sometimes going back and forth for deeper understanding. In those interactions, are you more collaborating with the AI throughout the problem-solving process, or do you tend to gather the information you need and then go implement independently?

User: It can be both. I will collaborate with the model to solve a problem and implement the fix to validate that it works. In some cases, I may go back to ask clarification questions or ask about related implementations to better build a system that is efficient and uses the best techniques for my use case.

AI: That hybrid approach sounds really flexible - using the AI as both a problem-solving partner and then a resource for optimization.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has particular approaches or guidelines around AI use?

User: I do not believe my team or workplace has influenced my use of AI, as AI has not been pushed on the employees. Because of this there are no major guidelines in place besides making sure confidential information is not shared with any models.

AI: So you've largely developed your own approach organically, with just that key confidentiality boundary in place.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time that I was frustrated was during the early stages of LLM. When using less common languages, sometimes the models would mix up concepts with more commonly used languages, which created more difficulty solving my problems due to unrelated information.

AI: That's a really concrete example of how model limitations can create friction. It sounds like that mixing of language concepts actually made things worse than if you hadn't used AI at all in those cases.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: To maintain my skill, I continue to practice these skills on my own. This might be starting a project using these skills at work or as a personal project.

AI: That's a proactive approach - staying sharp through practice both at work and in personal projects.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I hope to continue using AI as I do now. Mainly as a new search engine and for knowledge-based collaboration. In the future, I hope to have AI integrated in a more physical form, i.e, robotics, since my job is in the embedded space and thus requires physical work from time to time.

AI: That's fascinating - the idea of AI moving from being a knowledge resource to having a physical presence in your embedded systems work. That would be quite a shift from text-based interactions to having AI assist with the hands-on aspects of your job.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you balance confidentiality concerns with getting the help you need, and your systematic approach to building for future expansion.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a knowledge resource while maintaining strong security boundaries, and your thoughtful approach to system design, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
