Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: nope, lets start

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to shorten the amount of time I spend gathering and compiling reserach for stories Im writing, to spell and grammar check stories i have written, to brainstorm ideas, and to read and summarize large presentations and documents

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you across several different stages of your writing process. 

When you mention using it for research gathering and compiling - can you walk me through what that actually looks like? How does that process typically unfold for you?

User: I typically will ask for a list of top quality sources then I will pull relevant pages from those sources and ask AI to read, analyze, or summarize the information

AI: That's interesting - so you're doing a kind of two-step process where AI suggests sources but then you're the one actually selecting and pulling the specific pages. 

Tell me more about that middle step where you're choosing which pages to pull from those sources. What are you looking for when you make those decisions?

User: I dont trust AI to pull compeltely facutal reserach on its own so im trying to make sure its not hallucinating by going straight to the source first and saving time by having ai help me summarize it based on the information im looking for

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - essentially using AI as a research assistant while maintaining editorial control over the sources. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your writing process you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: id prefer to handle all creative and writing steps myself. I have attemped to use AI to help with writing but it adds more time to the process than it saves. I dont think its a good writer and it makes too many mistakes. I like writing, its my favorite part of my job and I don't want to outsource it

AI: That's a clear distinction you're drawing - keeping the creative heart of your work for yourself while letting AI handle more of the operational tasks around it.

When you do use AI for those research and administrative tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have an ongoing back-and-forth conversation with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it specific assignments to complete independently?

User: I always have a back and forth. I review the work at each step and reiterate what is needed to make sure the AI work is mor accurate. I do not trust it to complete tasks on its own

AI: So you're maintaining pretty close oversight throughout the process. That collaborative approach seems to tie back to your earlier point about not trusting AI to work independently on factual research.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or practices around you that have shaped your approach?

User: we are encouraged to try new tools and approaches to save time and streamline processes. I have been asked to help create a specific editing tool for our team to help make projects move more quickly. I have been told that I wont be replaced by AI but by people who know how to use it so we are being taught how to use it

AI: That's a pretty direct message from your workplace about AI's role. It sounds like there's both encouragement to experiment but also some underlying tension about staying relevant.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I felt particualrly satisfied when I used AI to pull information from a lenghty deck into relevant bullet points for my task. it works so well that I was able to later reference those points to successfully defend my work

AI: That sounds like a great example of AI actually enhancing your ability to do your core work well - helping you prepare to defend your own analysis and writing.

On the flip side, can you think of a time when using AI left you feeling frustrated? What was going on in that situation?

User: I asked ChatGPT to create an image and it kept repeating my ask saying "I have done [insert ask]" but it didn't do anything even remotely close. This went on for an hour.

AI: An hour of that back-and-forth must have been incredibly frustrating, especially when you could probably have created or found what you needed much faster on your own.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: yes. I think using AI is a good way to learn and then demonstrate the things I still do better than a LLM. I also try to use it sparingly so I don't lose my ability to say, brainstorm on my own or conduct proper research

AI: That's a really intentional balance you're striking - using AI as a learning tool while being mindful not to become overly dependent on it.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this heading for you?

User: Im afraid i will be asked to use it too much and lose my skills. Or waste my time correcting errors made by AI. I also fear it will replace human interaction and mentorship

AI: Those are some very real concerns - the balance between efficiency gains and potential skill atrophy, plus the human elements of work that might get lost.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've thought through maintaining that balance between leveraging AI's capabilities while preserving the creative and analytical skills that make your work valuable.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining creative control while strategically using AI for research and administrative tasks - and your thoughtful approach to skill preservation - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
