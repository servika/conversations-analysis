## Representative Examples

### Example 1: Interview 00568

**SDLC Score**: 21

**Categories**: design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "Depending on the day and the task, the primary way I use AI is in software development and testing. This will include helping to debug logs, explain code, refactor code, extract and manipulate code snippets, brainstorm ideas on the best use of algorithms, design patterns, etc."

2. "One example is when there's an error in the CI/CD pipeline. This is not an area I'm terribly familiar with, and the logs can be both exhaustive and opaque. Feeding the logs into LLMs and asking them to find the errors/failures and positing on the causes can often help me find the solution, or at lea..."

### Example 2: Interview 00304

**SDLC Score**: 19

**Categories**: requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I have a variety of uses for AI. I primarily use the Plus plan of ChatGPT. My use of AI ranges from writing Python, C# and SQL code for designing applications to streamline everyday business applications or larger scale projects. I also use ChatGPT to help me automate certain tasks, such as repetiti..."

2. "I started using AI to help me brainstorm and create a plan to build the project. Using AI, I did extensive research on different applications as well learning about previous work done in this topic. After scoping out the project, AI also helped me design the pipeline for the model. I used it to expl..."

### Example 3: Interview 00985

**SDLC Score**: 19

**Categories**: design, development, testing, projectManagement, versionControl, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I use AI throughout my workday for several types of tasks. I use it to help solve problems I might have related to coding. For example, if I have a bug that I'm not sure about, AI can help save me time debugging."

2. "I would start by providing the AI all the context I have. For example, if an email service was crashing with errors, I would describe the issue, provide a snapshot of code I believe to be the issue, provide the actual the error message, and provide any logs. I would ask the AI if it knows what the i..."

### Example 4: Interview 00923

**SDLC Score**: 17

**Categories**: requirements, development, testing, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "I mostly use AI to quickly explain things that I don't have the time to manually search myself on the internet (like programming languages' documentation), and when the response seems dubious to me I ask the AI for links to its sources. I also use it to code small portions of code that I could perfe..."

2. "I try to fit as much context as possible into the initial prompt and test the result, then go into more detail, add some preferences and provide specific fixes if the result from the initial prompt doesn't completely fit my initial need."

### Example 5: Interview 00091

**SDLC Score**: 16

**Categories**: requirements, development, testing, projectManagement, versionControl, documentation, collaboration

**Key Insights**:

1. "My role in my day job is a delivery manager, working with internal development teams, external vendors and general operations teams. This means my use of AI does vary on a day to day basis but includes using AI for capturing and summarising meetings and actions for sessions such as project standups,..."

2. "Alot of the work I am involved in is industry specific or requires specific business context that AI cannot assist with. Because of this I will typically start with using AI as a template or providing a foundation and then will adjust or complete to fit the needs of our business. This occurs across ..."
