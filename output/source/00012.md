Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope! Let's get started!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a novelist and I'm also learning how to write screenplays. With novels, my process is very chaotic but also very specific. I have no trouble coming up with ideas and I usually don't start writing until I know how it's going to end. This way, I make sure that I have a goal to shoot towards with every scene that I write. I don't outline and I also don't write in order. I also write very fast. I usually get a draft done within a month for a novel.

AI: That's a fascinating process - especially writing out of order while keeping that end goal in mind. It sounds like you have a very intuitive but goal-oriented approach.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: My weakest points are the middle of the novel and also the lead up towards the final 1/3 of the novel. I often have trouble coming up with strong reasons within the plot for the heroine to go on the big journey away from home, leaving behind everything they know. I also use AI to help me come up with descriptors for spaces and places since I hate doing that part.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI specifically to tackle the parts that feel most challenging or tedious to you. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I used it in YA fantasy novel to come up with descriptors for the unique city inside of an invisible magical shield. The city is adorned in gold and I wanted to try to come up with some unique ways to showcase this. I mostly like to get unique details rather than fully fleshed-out concepts. Just something to get the ideas jumpstarted for me. It felt great to have ideas to pick from instead of sitting around trying to do the grunt work myself. It can get disheartening to wait around for ideas to come.

AI: That sounds like a really practical use - getting those jumpstart ideas to choose from rather than staring at a blank page. 

When you're working with AI on these kinds of tasks, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm always driving the creative decisions. I never relinquish that hold. I think of the AI as if I'm talking to a writing partner. I've had many writing partners who I'll tell the general idea to and they'll throw out ideas for me to move forward or might even ask questions about stuff I haven't thought too deeply about. That's how I prefer for the AI to act. OR, I want it to offer a few ideas within a few sentences and I'll take it from there.

AI: That's a great analogy - thinking of it like a writing partner who throws out ideas and asks probing questions. It sounds like you have a very clear sense of maintaining creative control while using AI as a collaborative sounding board.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Speed is a big one, but probably more importantly, how I feel about myself as I write. I can get really down if I feel like I get stuck and can't think of anything new. It's so helpful to just go straight to AI to use as a sounding board so I don't get stuck. It feels really good to keep a steady writing pace.

AI: That emotional aspect is really compelling - how it's changed not just your output but your confidence and momentum as a writer. It sounds like it's helping you stay in that creative flow state.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I won't lie--I have a lot of concerns. I think AI should truly just be helper and never a replacer. AI should be around to help us with the mundane things so that we can do the creating. I want AI to take care of the little stuff so that I can keep creating art and beauty. If AI does all the fun stuff, where does that leave us as a species? I believe our greatest strength as a species is art, so I don't like the idea of AI replacing that aspect of what makes us us.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - using AI to handle the mundane so you can focus on the art and beauty. You clearly see a meaningful distinction between assistance and replacement.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Now that's a hard one. It's hard for me envision AI doing anymore for me than it's doing now. I think there's a fine line between the AI helping and becoming the creator. I want to make sure I retain the uniqueness of self and that I'm still the main visionary for every project. I guess how that could evolve is if the AI were to keep a log of everything we've talked about so that it has all of the information to continue to offer helpful advice--much like a human writing partner would.

AI: That's a really insightful vision - having AI that knows your work deeply enough to offer contextual advice, like a long-term collaborator would. It sounds like you want the technology to enhance that partnership dynamic rather than fundamentally change it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that fine line between AI helping and becoming the creator, and how you think about preserving what makes us uniquely human as artists.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's it. thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a creative writing partner while maintaining clear boundaries around artistic control have been incredibly valuable. The way you've thought about preserving human creativity and uniqueness while leveraging AI for support really highlights the nuanced relationship many creative professionals are navigating.

Your perspective will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts. Thanks again!
