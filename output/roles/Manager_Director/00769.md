Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good! I am ready

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do not really use AI on the regular for my role as a restaurant manager. I sometimes will use it when making a new resume though. I also have used it in the past to help me create summaries of my business data analysis.

AI: That's interesting - so it sounds like AI isn't part of your daily restaurant management routine, but you've found specific situations where it's been helpful. 

Tell me more about those business data analysis summaries. What was that experience like for you?

User: Sometimes when I try to create a summary for when I am presenting to my peers and supervisors then I get very long winded and create a summary that is much to long and detailed. Using AI to shorten it while keeping the key points has made it so that my presentations go smoother and do not bore the listeners with too much information which can drown out the important information.

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you communicate more effectively with your audience. When you're working with AI to shorten those summaries, what does that process look like for you? Do you go back and forth with it, or do you typically give it your long version and let it handle the condensing on its own?

User: I would create the long summary and then ask for the AI to shorten it. Then I would ask for some edits for various reasons and continue to do so until I think it is good.

AI: So you're really collaborating with it - giving it your initial work, then guiding the refinements until it meets your needs. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your restaurant management role that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I am not a great planner so I think that is the main reason I have not used AI as much as I could/should. It does not feel like AI as readily available as I need though too. If I had an AI that was more readily available so that I could pull it out for tasks throughout the day then it would help quite a bit.

AI: That's really insightful - so it sounds like there's a gap between when you might find AI helpful and how accessible it feels in the moment when you need it. 

What would "more readily available" look like for you in your restaurant management context? What kinds of situations come up during your day where you think AI could help if you could access it more easily?

User: It is becoming much more relevant with phones coming with it pre-installed now but I am not sure how great those AIs are. It is something I will try more! The tasks it could help me with would probably be planning/organizing my work for better time management, helping with scheduling, data analysis, and sales forecasting.

AI: It sounds like you can see a lot of potential applications - planning, scheduling, data analysis, sales forecasting. That's quite a range of tasks that could really impact your day-to-day work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you think about using AI in your work? Are other people in your restaurant or company using AI tools, or is this something you're exploring more on your own?

User: It definitely is not used much or at all really from what I have seen. There are quite a bit of older people amongst my peers and supervisors so that probably has something to do with holding back the use of AI since older people do not like the idea of using AI. It is something I will definitly explore on my own!

AI: That workplace dynamic sounds like it plays a significant role. Since you mentioned you'll be exploring AI more on your own, especially with it becoming more accessible on phones - how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially help? For instance, in those areas like planning or data analysis that you mentioned?

User: I think it will definitely be used as a tool and not completely replace me in those tasks. So I would not be worried about maintaining my skills in those areas.

AI: That's a balanced perspective - seeing it as a tool rather than a replacement. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I have used AI to create resumes in the past and it has been amazing! It does very well at listening to my requests to make a resume that sounds professional.

AI: That's wonderful to hear that the resume creation went so well! What specifically made that experience feel amazing for you? Was it how it followed your requests, the professional tone it achieved, or something else about that interaction?

User: I was able to create a few different iterations that were geared towards different jobs I was applying for. Each of them were similar but had wording that made my experience sound better and relevant to each different job.

AI: That ability to tailor your experience for different roles sounds incredibly valuable. It's interesting how AI helped you present the same background in multiple ways.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Especially as you mentioned planning to explore it more with the phone accessibility?

User: I think using it to plan out my week with my different tasks for the week is the start. Then throughout the week making sure I use my phone to help when I am doing scheduling, making reports for my team, and forecasting for the next couple of weeks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how workplace culture affects AI adoption and your practical vision for integrating it into weekly planning and daily tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the gap between AI's potential and its accessibility, the influence of workplace culture on adoption, and your practical approach to gradually integrating AI tools will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
