Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, I do not have any questions.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In a typical workday I use AI often for content creation- to summarize, write content, optimize writing, proof read, and to generate ideas. More specifically in real estate as a broker it's helpful to draft emails, create Instagram post ideas with captions, and to create content plans for the week.  I also like to use AI when creating schedules for the day or week, to summarize and organize a list of tasks that need to get done. Sometimes I like to use it to get general feedback on ideas. In financial modelling, I've tried using it for math or forecasting but there are often errors in the math

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into different aspects of your real estate work. 

You mentioned that you've encountered errors when using AI for math or forecasting in financial modeling. Tell me more about that experience - what happened and how did you handle those situations?

User: The calculations are sometimes wrong, so having to double check or verify. This ends up taking too much time, I could just do it myself in less time. I do still use it for workflow or modelling ideas if I'm thinking of creating something new.

AI: That makes sense - the verification step can definitely eat into the time savings. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to finalize wording or the  order of completing things myself. Sometimes to feed in minute details for every edit would be too difficult. I often just get a draft that's close to what I want, then copy it into word and then finalize edits there.

AI: That's interesting - so you use AI more as a starting point and then take control of the final refinements yourself.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more likely to collaborate with it through a task, I've never been able to completely delegate the full task to AI. My typical interaction patter is to start the task with a "brain dump", all the details I want, parameters I need to meet, what I'm looking for and get a starting point. Then add in revisions, parameters or requirements I forgot about or missed. Then maybe revise a bit more, ask some questions. When it's close to complete, copy it out to word, and add final revisions myself. Sometimes I'll paste it back in for final thoughts or feedback.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like a very deliberate process you've developed. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not all all. I find that most people do not use AI at all.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're essentially pioneering AI use in your workplace. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Satisfied: I found for my real estate Instagram page that I wasn't posting as often as I would like. I asked Chat GPT to create a social media schedule for the week. I fed in some ideas I had and it came up with a plan of what to post each day, came up with the content and even suggested the type of photos to use. It took a task I was avoiding and gave me a full plan to start with. I did tweak it, but just getting started was the barrier. I was able to spend a few hours, create the content and schedule it all to be posted during the week. It felt satisfying to get it checked off after avoiding the task for months.

AI: That's a great example of how AI helped you overcome that initial hurdle. The fact that it went from something you'd been avoiding for months to something you could complete in a few hours is really striking.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do consider it, and I think with AI taking over mundane tasks It will force me to really focus on the things that AI may not be able to take over. Things like customer service where you can relate to someone and connect over experiences or similar circumstances. Creating in person events or experiences. Following up in a meaningful way. I also think that taking content generated by AI and then changing some of the language or speech patterns to sound more like myself, or less generic is where my skills will shine in a world where some people are just using outputs straight from AI.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - using your human touch to differentiate yourself, especially in relationship-building and personalizing content. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I would love AI to help me streamline my life. Making it easier to get away from the mundane tasks. Simple things like inputting a to do list and having it broken down into a schedule. Having it remind me of things that need to get done by a certain date. It reduces the mental load. I think using it as an initial jump off point allows me to free up time that I would take getting to that point. I would like to ideally have it be more integrated as an assistant.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you overcome those initial barriers to getting started on tasks you've been avoiding, and your strategic thinking about focusing on the uniquely human skills that AI can't replicate.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think that's it for now

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative starting point, the importance of adding your personal touch to outputs, and your vision for AI as an integrated assistant will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
