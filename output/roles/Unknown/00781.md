Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no questions, that sounds good

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it to handle putting together emails to clients, like asking about project information and asking for material properties for different types of products we use ( I am a transmission line engineer). I also use it for giving me advice on things and explaining terminology since I am somewhat new to the job

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like you're using AI for both communication and learning aspects of your work as a transmission line engineer.

When you say you use it for "giving advice on things" - could you walk me through what that looks like? What kind of advice are you typically seeking?

User: For example, I give the AI certain possible locations a steel pole can go, and give it the pros and cons of each location. I have it give me reasoning pertaining to transmission line standards and which location might be the best fit. I am basically looking for guidance without having to waste time of my higher ups

AI: That's a fascinating use case - using AI as a kind of analytical sounding board before escalating decisions. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: We have to do checks to make sure our products will fit when attached together. I prefer to do them myself because it would take longer and harder to set up for an AI to do, when I already know where to look for the information I need and the formatting of the document

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you've developed your own efficient process for those checks and know exactly where to find what you need.

When you do use AI for work - like with those location decisions or email drafting - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a task, or do you tend to give it everything upfront and let it handle the task independently?

User: I like to give it everything upfront, the way I see AI is giving it a large amount of info it can use as its baseline, and if there are changes or misunderstandings I will correct as the converseation goes, but I like to give it all upfront to reduce misunderstandings

AI: That's an interesting approach - front-loading the context to minimize back-and-forth corrections. It sounds like you've developed a pretty systematic way of working with AI.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others using it similarly, or have you noticed different approaches?

User: I haven't conversated with my colleagues about AI use, but I assume they might be using it for similar tasks. They have been working longer than me with more experience so the types of things I use AI for, they might not need to.

AI: That's a thoughtful observation about experience levels affecting AI needs. It sounds like you're kind of pioneering your own approach without much direct influence from colleagues.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Asking it for reasoning on a structure location. It wasn't giving me useful information but that is partly limited to the fact that my job follows different standards depending on the client, and I don't trust giving those standards into AI

AI: That's a really insightful example - it highlights the tension between wanting AI's analytical help but having confidential or client-specific information that you can't share with it.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't think AI will ever take over my job because it is so software focused and having to understand past client decisions.

AI: That's an interesting perspective - the institutional knowledge and software-specific work creating a natural boundary.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll use it more, differently, or about the same as you gain more experience in your role?

User: I would like to be able to start to use it for more menial tasks like checking the fit for products, creating reports on my software for my models. I hope to use it more but for different reasons than I am now

AI: That's really interesting - so shifting from using it as a learning and guidance tool toward more of an efficiency tool for routine tasks as you build your expertise.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how experience level affects AI needs, and that tension between wanting analytical help but needing to protect client-specific information.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that is all, other than the fact that I hope AI will be able to integrate into software program uses, especially ones without large amounts of info online like the one I use

AI: That's a really valuable point - the challenge of AI integration with specialized industry software that doesn't have much publicly available information. That seems like it would be a game-changer for your field.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a learning tool early in your career and your thoughtful approach to information sharing will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
