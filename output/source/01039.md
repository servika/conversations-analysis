Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions! Let's do this.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I primarily use it to write copy (web pages, checkout pages, marketing emails), as well as cleaning up and  improving emails to team members (basic grammar, formatting, etc.).  I'll also use it to manage data, like order exports (creating reports, organizing, deciphering).  I'll use it to find the strongest comments in a chat thread or strongest moments of a video in a transcript.  I'll also use it if I need help coding something simple in html or css. I'll use it to research things or figure out how to do things / ideas we want to implement. I'll also ask if to help with marketing strategy or idea generation.

AI: That's quite a range of tasks! It sounds like you're using AI across many different aspects of your work.

When you mentioned using AI to find the strongest comments in a chat thread or strongest moments in a video transcript - can you tell me more about how that works? What does that process look like for you?

User: generally, it's a youtube live video we just had. i'll use an extension on my web browser to export the live chat, then upload that to ai and ask it to pull the most compelling comments. usually, i give it examples of comments we've used previously so it knows the kinds of things we're looking for. if it's a video transcript, i'm asking it to look for certain parts, so i can gather the timestamps, or maybe i need to find strong quotes that the speaker said,.

AI: That's really interesting - you're essentially using AI to help you curate and extract valuable content from these live interactions. 

I'm curious about your decision to provide examples of comments you've used before. What led you to that approach, and how does it change the results you get compared to just asking for "compelling comments" without those examples?

User: i think i started out providing the examples so the ai would know what we were looking for--to provide guidance vs. just a shot in the dark. we typically use these comments in marketing emails to compel those to watch the replays who didn't catch it live, so we want the comments to have a certain energy.  i'm not sure if i've ever asked for the comments without providing the examples. but there have been times when (unfortunately) the ai hallucinated comments--it made them up instead of pulling from the file. when fact checking the comments, they weren't actually in the chat transcript.

AI: That hallucination issue sounds frustrating, especially when you're using those comments for marketing purposes where accuracy is crucial.

When you discovered the AI had made up comments, how did you handle that situation? Did it change how you approach this type of task now?

User: it did.... now i'm a bit hesitant because it ends up causing more work for us. if the ai is unreliable and i'm having to spend time fact checking, it's counter productive. i want to trust that it's not making things up and performing the task asked (with reason--we understand mistakes happen). in that case though, i continued working with the ai to try and get it to realize it wasn't proving real comments, and it was futile. i ended up giving up. now i have to doublecheck the ai's responses when it provides comments for these types of tasks

AI: That's a really significant shift - going from trusting the AI to handle the task to having to build in verification steps that potentially make the process less efficient than you'd hoped.

When you think about other tasks you mentioned - like writing copy, cleaning up emails, or data management - do you find yourself applying that same level of skepticism and double-checking, or does the trust level vary depending on the type of work?

User: i have less skepticism when it comes to creative tasks like the copy writing and basic things like cleaning up emails. generally, those tasks are performed well and save me time. i don't have to doublecheck the work as much, therefore i trust it without over thinking it. i do worry about when it comes to data management, working with excel files and numbers. i'm a bit fearful mistakes will be made and i'll provide inaccurate results or data to the team that we use to make business decisions.

AI: That distinction makes a lot of sense - higher trust for creative work where there's more flexibility, but more caution with data that drives business decisions.

When you do use AI for data management despite those concerns, what does your process look like? Do you build in specific checks, or are there certain types of data tasks you avoid altogether?

User: i don't do too, too much data management, but there have been times i've combine some order exports or membership reports. honestly, i probably haven't implemented more ai assistance because i'm fearful that it will make a mistake and i'll have to just do it myself, so i end up just doing it myself to avoid the risk and wasted time.

AI: That fear of having to redo the work is really understandable - it sounds like you're weighing the potential time savings against the risk of creating more work for yourself.

Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the ones where you do lean on AI?

User: things that very detail oriented, or moving a lot of data around, or are numbers-heavy, are tasks i just do myself, though i would love to have ai do it for me. perhaps it's just i don't have the knowledge to interact with the ai appropriately. i don't know what it's capable of, so i just do it myself to avoid creating more work for myself. the tasks that i can quickly tell whether or not there's an issue (copy writing, emails, simple taks), are the ones i lean on ai more. the ones that won't obviously show there was an error (like calculations and number-based tasks) are the ones i'm more hesitant to work with ai on. because how will i know the numbers are right without do the work myself to fact check?

AI: That's a really insightful way to think about it - the visibility of potential errors seems to be a key factor in your comfort level. 

You mentioned that you might not know what AI is capable of with data tasks, so you default to doing it yourself. Have there been situations where you've been surprised by what AI could or couldn't handle - either positively or negatively?

User: i'm sure there have been! probably more so positively. it's usually when i stumble upon the discovery. i'll just ask myself, "i wonder if ai can help with this" and give it a try and i'm pleasantly surprised. i don't think i can think of an exact example at this moment though, unfortunately

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like some of your best experiences with AI have come from those spontaneous moments of curiosity rather than planned integration.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: generally, we collaborate. especially if it's copy writing. i'll make tweaks and send back to it, and we'll improve it together. that way it knows the voice and style we prefer as a brand. or if it provides something that doesn't meet my expectations, i'll ask it to try again. i haven't really had many experiences where i've delegated tasks for it to handle independently.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like it helps you maintain control while still getting the benefits of AI assistance.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others on your team using it similarly, or do you find yourself navigating this more independently?

User: oh no, the whole team is very pro-ai. any time something comes up where we are asking ourselves "can we do this?" or "how do we do this?" the team will say "ask or work with ai." my boss is a spiritual speaker, and he's even started teaching courses about how to us ai in a spiritual aspect.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you have a really supportive and encouraging environment for AI adoption, even extending into spiritual applications with your boss's courses.

Given that pro-AI culture, do you find that influences how you approach tasks, or does it create any kind of pressure to use AI even when you might prefer to handle something yourself?

User: if anything, it's just annoying that they continue to suggest it when it's already my first instinct, lol. i don't really feel any pressure though

AI: Ha! That's actually pretty funny - you're already ahead of the curve and they're still catching up to suggest what you're already thinking.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: well the comment hallucinations we already discussed was super frustrating. but as far as satisfied, it was probably when i had to write a complete email sequence on my own (first time i've had to do that, and mind you, i'm not a copywriter), and i worked with ai to help me write like 6 emails. it helped me plan them out and then write them. and it saved me so much time and frustration. literally, i probably would have cried if i'd had to do that unassisted.

AI: That sounds like such a relief! Going from potentially crying over having to write 6 emails on your own to successfully completing them with AI's help - that's a pretty dramatic difference in experience.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: sorry, can you re-word that question so i can better understand it?

AI: Of course! Let me put it differently.

Do you ever worry about getting rusty at certain skills because you're using AI to help with them? Or do you think about whether you should still practice doing things manually to keep those abilities sharp?

User: hmm, maybe slightly. though, i feel like i use ai to help with tasks that i didn't have the skills to complete to start with. like the emails and copywriting. that's not my expertise or background, but was just assigned the task. i don't even enjoy it, so it's not something i want to improve my skills upon. it does cross my mind occasionally that i should still at least flex those muscles so as not to get too rusty when it comes to tasks i pass off to ai. to stay sharp and to not be tooooo reliant.

AI: That makes sense - AI is helping you tackle things outside your wheelhouse rather than replacing skills you already had strong.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: i'd love to utilize it more! i think i need to become privy to the ways it can help me that i'm not aware of now. some more research is needed! that way, i can save time on tasks that i can rely on it to complete.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described the difference between tasks where errors are easily visible versus those where they might be hidden - that distinction between creative work and data management really illuminates how trust develops differently across different types of tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nothing is coming to mind at this time. thanks!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between collaboration and delegation, the role of error visibility in building trust, and how you navigate AI adoption in a supportive workplace culture will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk through these different scenarios with me. Have a great rest of your day!
