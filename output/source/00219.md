Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for some routine tasks - summarizing emails, comparing documents, and creating Excel formulas when I can't remember them.

AI: Tell me more about those document comparisons. What kinds of documents are you typically comparing, and what are you looking for when you do that?

User: I work with a lot of contracts. Sometimes I will send a copy of a contract to someone, and they'll edit and return it without tracking changes. I will ask AI to compare my original contract with their edited contract and highlight changes. This saves time - I don't have to go line by line through multiple pages to compare the contracts.

AI: That sounds like a real time-saver. When you're working through those contract comparisons, how do you typically handle what comes next? Do you review the AI's findings and then make your own decisions about the changes, or does your process look different?

User: Yes, I look at the AI's findings, and do an overview to make sure nothing was missed. I also ask the person who made the edits to verify that all of their changes are there - a second set of eyes ensures that we catch any misses.

AI: I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned those contract comparisons, email summaries, and Excel formulas - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to write emails and process documents myself, rather than having AI write those. I will sometimes have AI check grammar and spelling, but I like writing. If I have AI help with more tedious tasks, like the comparisons, that allows me more time to do work I like.

AI: That's interesting - it sounds like you're being strategic about which tasks to delegate. When you do use AI for those tedious tasks like contract comparisons, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the task, or do you tend to give it the complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: If it is a one-step task, such as an excel formula, I'll give the AI the task to handle independently, and then review at the end. If it is a complex task, I will go back and forth with the AI to make sure my requests are understood and the information from the AI meets what I need.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Our upper leadership encourages my team to learn more about AI and use it in our work. There is some resistance from team members who are not as familiar with technology, so I intentionally look for opportunities to use AI in my work. This allows me to share my knowledge with these team members so they (hopefully) have an easier time incorporating AI into their own work. I might not use AI as much if I didn't have this additional reason to do so in order to support my team.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The first time I used AI to compare contracts was definitely satisfying. I was looking at multiple pages of tiny, single-spaced paragraphs that would have taken me forever to compare. I had AI compare the two versions, and it was so incredibly fast! It was also very accurate, which had been a concern of mine. The AI caught all the differences and I was able to get the contract signed much sooner than if I had to do a manual comparison.

AI: That sounds like a real breakthrough moment for you. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: It is absolutely something I consider. That's part of the reason why I don't use AI for work tasks that I really enjoy; I want to maintain my skills in those areas. I have also read some studies that indicate a heavy reliance on AI can negatively impact a person's ability to analyze and create, which I want to avoid. I consider AI to be a very useful tool, but not a replacement for my own brain - it should be a cooperative venture.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I am planning to incorporate AI more in the future. We have some restrictions at work regarding what models we can use, and what tools. For instance, we are not permitted to use AI for meeting notes due to security reasons. However, my organization is slowly adapting and finding solutions that do work within our security parameters, so I expect there will be more tools available to us each year. I plan to expand my own use of AI every time more resources are approved, and share my knowledge with my team as well.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being intentional about which tasks to keep for yourself versus delegate, and how you're thinking strategically about skill maintenance while still embracing AI as a collaborative tool.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all I have to share.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically - both for efficiency gains and to support your team's learning - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been about balancing the benefits of AI assistance with maintaining your own skills and preferences. Have a great rest of your day!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! Take care!
