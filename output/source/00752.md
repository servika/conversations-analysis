Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, thank you. Let's proceed.

AI: Great, let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically, I see AI used most often in emails and other communications in my workplace. Busy colleagues clearly rely on AI models for a good amount of these tasks, and the results are so cookie cutter that an AI-generated email has become obvious. I don't use any AI models for these kinds of tasks in my daily work, as I prefer to write messages myself. Tasks such as data management and analysis I do use AI models, though they are not infallible. Most often I use AI models for help with long-term data analysis and observations, organizing my notes, etc. to prepare for meetings, and to spur on ideation.

AI: That's interesting that you can spot AI-generated emails from colleagues. Tell me more about what makes them so obviously AI-generated to you.

User: I wouldn't say I am an expert, but the sheer number of emails that I receive that are AI-assisted makes the patterns stand out. What is ironic about the AI-generated models is that they are more often much better written than their human counterparts. Before the proliferation readily-available AI models, most emails I received were poorly written, riddled with spelling and grammatical error, and most were very short. Work emails and inquiries, especially surrounding sensitive subjects, are now full of grace and manners, good sentence structure, salutations and sign offs, and similar turns of phrase. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but reading "I hope this email finds you well," at the beginning of enough emails and you'll start to notice the use of AI models for these messages is increasing rapidly.

AI: That's a fascinating observation about the improvement in email quality revealing AI use. You mentioned you choose to write your own messages rather than use AI for communications. What drives that preference for you?

User: The preference for writing my own messages comes from my belief that the written word is more than just words to be solubilized and regurgitated. There is a clear difference between the work of one author and another, and I feel that even in an arena as banal as the work email there is a place for personalization and connection. As models improve, I'm sure they will be able to become more customized for the individual user and more helpful even for people like me that prefer writing messages themselves and will write closer to the author's style. But for now I find a personal touch stands out in the current waves of AI-assisted emails, and often gets better engagement from the audience.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective on maintaining personal connection through writing. You also mentioned using AI for data analysis and meeting preparation. Can you walk me through what a typical interaction looks like when you're using AI for those tasks?

User: When I have particular data sets taken over long periods of time, they often come with a lot of notation that can be difficult to make sense of after the fact. AI models have been very helpful in their ability to take the raw data and notes and give me a summary of my notation and suggestions on future planning. I

AI: It sounds like you were in the middle of sharing something there - please continue with how AI helps you with those data sets and planning.

User: My apologies- let me continue.

AI: No problem at all - please go ahead.

User: Typically I will gather data and notations and use AI chatbot models to analyze by feeding the data as a prompt, series of prompts, or conversation. Oftentimes the AI models can make sense of my raw notes, which have been transcribed from scribbles in a notebook and show me trends I might not have realized and have been very helpful in that sense.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're using AI to analyze your notes and identify trends, do you find yourself working collaboratively with the AI - going back and forth with follow-up questions and refinements - or do you tend to give it the data and let it provide a complete analysis on its own?

User: When using AI to analyze my notes and identify trends, I've used both approaches: feeding the AI model large sets of data and asking for a full analysis, and using the AI model for more of a conversation back and forth while feeding it smaller chunks of the information to work collaboratively. Both have been effective and productive, and saved me time and/or inspired better results. I have preferred the collaborative approach most often, as I find it provides me with more inspiration and feels more genuine- like a brainstorming meeting with a close colleague rather than a machine from Dr. Seuss: insert data, never see quite how it works, and out pops a result. The collaborative approach has allowed me to use AI in ways that are more helpful and allow me to learn along with the data analysis, giving me a better understanding of the data.

AI: That's a great analogy about the Dr. Seuss machine! You mentioned that the collaborative approach feels more genuine and helps you learn. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: My workplace culture is very accepting of AI, seeing the results of chatbots as wonderful innovations that free them from the parts of their job they most dread: communications. It seems that most people's aversion to communication, and insecurities about their own writing abilities makes these kinds of tasks harder for them. Most of my colleagues have used AI in professional writing, communications, etc. This has allowed me to feel that AI is accepted and widespread, and made me more likely to turn to an AI model to help with menial tasks.

AI: That's an interesting contrast - your colleagues embracing AI for the tasks they dread while you prefer to keep those personal. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: A time when AI at work has made me particularly satisfied was while dealing with a recurring issue that we'd gathered data on over a long period, tried varying approaches to with similar results, and were feeling like no change would occur to see the results we wanted. AI was able to help me see a slight trend in the data and my notation in particular that led to a solution over time. There has not been a time at work that I felt particularly frustrated with AI, though I don't feel that at work I am particularly testing the outer limits of the models I've used.

AI: That's a great example of AI helping you spot something you might have missed. You mentioned not pushing AI to its limits at work. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do actively consider the maintenance of skills in areas where AI could potentially take over, though it is not a great concern at this point. I am curious to see areas of growth in AI abilities and what skills as a human will still be valuable.

AI: That's a balanced perspective. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: It seems that there will be more opportunities to see AI being used in the workplace, and my relationship with AI evolving as a result. Right now, it feels very "dot com bubble" out there. I don't mean financially, as I see AI companies being revolutionary in ways that everything in the bubble wasn't - there is substance to the products, but the products need improvement. I think there will be a lot of AI adopted in the workplace systemically - like whole companies relying on a certain model set, then contracting with the next, etc. before finally settling on the product that best meets their needs. So I just don't see that process being instantaneous, and in my workplace almost all AI being used is through people's personal exploration and usage, rather than as a company or organization. I think my relationship will evolve into one of more acceptance for routine tasks, though I don't foresee me using it to communicate exclusively.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the "dot com bubble" feeling and how you see the distinction between AI improving email quality while losing personal connection.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, thank you for the conversation.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between efficiency and personal connection, and your thoughtful approach to collaborating with AI rather than just delegating to it, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
