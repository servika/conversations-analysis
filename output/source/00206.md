**Transcript ID:** AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - spending two hours on what turned out to be a hallucination. When you say the model ""refused to admit that it could not help directly

" what was that experience like for you? How did it present those unhelpful suggestions?

User: It claimed that this was a common issue and an easy fix. This made it seem like it was ready to provide the answer, which felt really deceitful when I realised it wasn't true.

AI: That sense of being misled when the AI presented itself as confident about something it didn't actually know sounds really frustrating. Given that experience, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not too worried about it. AI is an incredible tool, but working with it has made me very aware of its limitations. I don't think it will take over any role I'm in completely, provided I'm willing to stay flexible and learn new things.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - staying aware of both the capabilities and limitations. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will continue to stay up to date with new AI capabilities and limitations and use it as another arrow in the quiver. I try to stay realistic about what it can and can't achieve. I imagine I'll rely on it more and more for planning as its capabilities grow and it becomes more reliable

AI: That makes sense - planning seems like an area where you could see expanding use as reliability improves. 

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how you draw clear boundaries between what you delegate versus keep control of, and that honest account of the Flutter debugging frustration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No that's all on my end! Thanks.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that lead role on important work, advocating for AI adoption while staying realistic about limitations, and especially that candid example about the debugging incident - all of this will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
