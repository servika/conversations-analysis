Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm an author of fiction, mainly Science Fiction and Fantasy, so a typical project for me would be a novel or short story that I write. My projects usually involve working for a set amount of time a day to get the words down for the first draft. I then need to revise this draft in what is a 'story draft' that is mostly to make sure the plot and other elements make sense and work, this is followed with a 'grammar draft' to check for errors like punctuation. Finally I aim for a proofread from a few people. Finally the project gets released, but then there are additional areas for marketing and promoting the book, depending if it is something I'm self-publishing.

AI: That's a really comprehensive process - I can see how much work goes into each stage from initial draft through to publication and promotion. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: So, I've been using AI recently across all stages in various capacities so I'll go through each area with examples. First up, during the first drafting stage I've been using AI to help with research as well as finding similar works that meet the tone, genre, or overall ideas of the story I'm working on. This has included exploring the main key touchstones of a genre (e.g. What are some key components of a Survival Horror story?, What are some successful Survival Horror books, Films, TV shows and music that evokes the atmosphere). Using this I can develop some inspiration as well as using the music while writing to set the tone. 

During the drafting stage, I use AI to have a quick check of chapters as I write them (or sections depending on the word count) and ask for general feedback. I am careful to specify I don't want suggestions for the story, as I feel this could influence my writing, instead I ask for criticism on the overall tone  and feel. I use the previous conversation  to continue this so the model's know my aim (e.g. Survival Horror Genre) so it can provide relevant feedback. During this process, I sometimes ask the model to lay out the story so far into a story-template such as 'Save The Cat' or 'Three Act Structure' which can help provide a skeleton look at the story to help me navigate and see where the story is sitting in terms of plot. 

Once the first draft is completed. I often ask the AI to provide full feedback on the story and also ask questions such as 'What would a reader feel is missing? Are there any plot points that do not feel fully resolved?' to help me prepare for the 'story draft' I mentioned earlier. 

I usually work through the story draft without using AI too much, as this is the stage where I'm trying to tidy it up so less involvement makes this easier. 

For the Grammar Draft, I usually go through the draft with a checker such as Grammarly, and then once its all done I'll use another AI model to provide feedback and catch anything that may have been missed. This is about the end of the AI use for the story, as I'll turn to human proof readers for the final stages.  

However, once release, I have used AI to help create social media content, but this is an area I'm still quite new at using it for.

AI: That's fascinating - you've really integrated AI across almost every stage of your process in very thoughtful ways. I'm particularly struck by how intentional you are about asking for tone feedback rather than story suggestions to preserve your creative vision.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Sure. So, a recent project was a short story I was working on for an Southern Gothic story I was working on. In this case I used the AI as I described earlier and gathered several inspiration ideas and music which lead to a playlist of music I used when writing. I then posted each chapter into the model for feedback, and the first thing that I really like was having that instant feedback on something which, as a writer, you often don't get feedback until you've finished the whole thing which can take a long, long time!! As such, this provided me with a great motivation to keep going as well as helping me to refine and see my ideas coming to life within the story structure. It really made the process flow better. I did have to reiterate the 'give me feedback not suggestions' aspect a couple of times, but this is something I can see developing as I use the model more often.

AI: That instant feedback aspect sounds really valuable - I can imagine how isolating the writing process can be without that kind of regular input. It's interesting that you had to reinforce the "feedback not suggestions" boundary a few times.

When you're working with AI in this way, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I would say I am the driving force for the creative decisions, as I make sure to lead with prompts that try to define exactly what I'm looking for. In this way, I think the collaboration is like having an assistant that is always on hand and can perform tasks pretty much instantly, which is ideal really.  I can see how people would be hesitant of using the AI, in the way I explained about providing suggestions over feedback, but this is the same as if you had another person read a story and make suggestions.

AI: That's a really insightful comparison to having a human assistant or reader. It sounds like you've found a way to maintain clear creative ownership while leveraging the AI's availability and speed.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I think developing writing habits have changed for sure, as having the assistant on hand to provide feedback has been a motivator in some ways, like wanting to make sure I have something to get feedback on makes you want to write more. Of course, refining the model's balance between just praise and constructive criticism is key as sometimes it might feel good for the model to always say what you've done is great, but deep down you want it to help you make the work better even if it means providing some harsh feedback!

AI: That's such an honest insight about the balance between praise and constructive criticism - it sounds like there's a real skill in calibrating that feedback to be genuinely helpful rather than just encouraging. The motivation aspect is really interesting too.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: The biggest concern as a self-published author is that the market can become filled with works by people who have used AI to write a whole story without much actual input from themselves. Tyring to get people to see your work is a huge factor in making any kind of money or getting seen in the publishing world, so when there are so many people who could tell AI to write the whole story, and then publish it, makes the market become flooded with words and therefore standing out is like a needle in a haystack. There are also concerns about the work being used to train models, and this should be looked at carefully as it is such a fine line between plagiarism and inspiration.

AI: Those are really significant concerns - the market saturation issue especially seems like it could fundamentally change the landscape for writers like yourself who are putting in genuine creative effort. The training data question is complex too.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think that it will continue in the way it has. I think using it for the proofreading/editing aspect is a big area I could see using way more as this is the biggest expense as a self-published author and also the most time-consuming after the actual writing. I feel that the more I use a model the more it will learn my writing and desires as a creative so it will become more and more of a 'second brain' almost that I can use as a wall to bounce ideas off and develop stories more. I often don't plot stories out too much, but I think I would likely use it to map out a story structure from scratch before writing and see if it helps improve my speed and focus on a story, such as one I'm working on now where I'm struggling with the ending, so I think maybe I'll use a model and train it on a structure (like the Save The Cat method I mentioned earlier) and them provide my idea of the story and work with the AI to map it out into the structure and then work from this structure.

AI: That vision of it becoming a "second brain" that learns your style and preferences over time is really compelling. The idea of using it to help with structural planning, especially for challenges like the ending you're working on, sounds like a natural evolution of how you're already using it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while leveraging AI as an instant feedback mechanism, and your honest assessment of both the benefits and market concerns.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think that's great. Thanks for the opportunity.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that balance between feedback and suggestions, using AI as a motivational tool, and your concerns about market saturation will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's clear you've developed a very thoughtful approach to integrating AI into your workflow while maintaining your creative agency. I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits and the challenges.

Thanks again, and best of luck with your current project - especially working out that ending!
