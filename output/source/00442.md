Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good. I'm ready to begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Currently we mostly use AI for data collection and to help develop ideas for projects. We also use it to help rewrite forms to sound more professional or to help come up with words or phrases to better get points across. I am a nurse and we gather patient information to send to Medicare and Medicaid for reimbursement. It is important that we are accurate. AI helps us gather the information more effectively and helps reduce user error. Human insight is still needed for clinical judgment.

AI: That's really helpful context. It sounds like AI is supporting you in multiple ways - from the administrative side with documentation and communication, to the more clinical side with data gathering.

When you mention that AI helps reduce user error in gathering patient information, can you tell me more about how that works in practice? What does that process look like day-to-day?

User: I currently review a 30 page document of patient assessments. This is looked at for the first 3 days a patient is admitted and the last 3 days. Some of the information gathered is incontinence episodes of both bowel and bladder. Currently AI gathers all this information and makes a determination of what the patient's continence level was the first 3 days of admission, whether they were incontinent, had stress incontinence, were continent or only incontinent one of the three days, etc. We also have a new FIT Tool that AI puts together and helps us to look at patient functioning in a much more efficient manner based on what we are reviewing, such as eating scores, shower/bathe, bed to chair transfers, etc.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI is helping you synthesize a lot of complex patient data into meaningful patterns and assessments. 

When AI makes these determinations about things like continence levels or puts together the FIT Tool assessments, how do you approach reviewing or validating what it's produced? What's your process for deciding whether to accept, modify, or override the AI's analysis?

User: That's where human clinical judgment comes to play. Other technicians such as nurses or therapists can put notes in the chart that help us determine the best scores to send to Medicare and Medicaid. AI does not currently read these notes. It only looks at the raw data. Human insight is needed to validate the final numbers. AI currently gathers the raw material and then we finish the job.

AI: That's a really clear picture of the collaboration. So AI handles the heavy lifting of sifting through all that raw assessment data, but you're the one who brings in the broader clinical context from those notes and your professional judgment to finalize everything.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I love all the help AI gives and hope that it assists more in the future. I think there will always need to be a human aspect in patient care. For instance, someone may look great on paper, but if you talk to them or assess them personally, you may find out they are sicker or more frail than they seem. It can also happen the other way. The patient may seem awful on paper, but you meet them and they are better than you think. also, there are other patients that present differently on different days. Having that human feedback along with AI's assessment can help build a complete and more accurate picture.

AI: That's such an insightful perspective - the idea that patients can present so differently than what the data might suggest, and that human assessment captures nuances that numbers alone can't reveal.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Currently I think that we tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently. It looks up certain data and reports that to us. We accept it as fact unless it is obviously wrong, or information does not support what it is reporting. I hope to use it more collaboratively in the future so that AI can focus on the data and we can handle more of the human aspect of patient care and focus less on charting which has become tedious and time consuming.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using AI to handle the data-heavy, time-consuming documentation so you can focus more on the actual patient care aspects of your work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has there been much discussion or guidance around incorporating these tools?

User: The workplace is actually encouraging more AI use. It bothers some that AI will take over our job, but we are assured that clinical judgement cannot be replace by AI.

AI: It sounds like your workplace is being proactive about AI adoption while also reassuring staff about job security. 

You mentioned that some colleagues worry about AI taking over jobs. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I usually feel satisfied with AI usage. I appreciate the additional time it affords me to do other tasks instead of doing a deep dive into numbers. Something that takes AI seconds could take me much longer, for instance, gathering the incontinence episodes of patients.

AI: That time savings really does sound significant - freeing you up from those deep numerical dives to focus on other important work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I have considered AI takeover as my current position is a lot of number crunching, however, as I said before, it would be hard for AI to make human decisions about care. Even if my job is taken over there are additional medical field jobs that I can move into in nursing care.

AI: That's a really practical and confident perspective - recognizing both the areas where AI excels and where human expertise remains essential, plus having that flexibility within nursing to pivot if needed.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Yes, I do see my relationship at work with AI evolving into a more collaborative effort. I also envision more use than data collection, such a virtual reality or smart features in patient care.

AI: That's exciting - moving from the current data collection focus toward more interactive technologies like VR and smart features in direct patient care.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI handles the data while human clinical judgment remains irreplaceable, and your vision of that evolving collaboration.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That is all. Thank you!

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights into how AI is supporting nursing work - from data collection to documentation, while preserving the essential human elements of patient care - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you described that balance between leveraging AI's efficiency and maintaining clinical judgment. Have a great rest of your day!
