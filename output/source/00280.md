Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: that sounds great! nope i have no questions, lets get started

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I do not typically use AI in my work day, but it does come in handy quite a bit when I am canvasing areas to go to. I work a door-to-door sales job in which high-income, upper-class people are my target audience. Using AI really helps me figure out where the above-average income class work and live, and as a result, allow me to interact more prominently with affluent individuals. I use it to guide me to specific areas and then help me plan out a designated route in which I will hit.

AI: That's a really interesting use case - using AI as a strategic planning tool for your territory mapping. When you say you use AI to figure out where high-income people work and live, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you actually go about getting that information from AI?

User: Ya definitely. It typically comes from me posing the question of what municipalities have the highest average income, and then which areas have the largest houses on average by square foot. This is because canvasing by house size allows me to sell the most expensive packages of house washing because, as you can imagine, the bigger the house, the more expensive it is to clean.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - targeting both income and house size to maximize your package value. So you're asking AI about municipalities and house sizes, and it's giving you that demographic and housing data. 

Once you get that information from AI about where to go, what happens next? Do you take that data and plan your routes yourself, or does AI help you with the actual route planning and canvassing strategy too?

User: it depends. i have often used AI to help plan a navigation route, as it routes exactly how far away each street is from one another. knowing that, i can plan how long it will take me to roughly hit each street based on background knowledge of how many people typically answer the door and how many of those interactions lead to a closing sale. so ultimately it is a combination of both AI navigation and my own personal knowledge.

AI: That's a fascinating blend of AI data and your own field experience. You're essentially using AI to handle the logistics and distance calculations, while your personal knowledge of conversion rates fills in the human element that AI couldn't know.

When you're working with AI on this route planning, how would you describe your interaction? Are you collaborating back and forth with it throughout the planning process, or do you tend to ask for specific information and then take that data to do your own planning?

User: absolutely a collaboration. ill ask questions and give a bunch of detail to the AI, and then based off what it says, fact-check and make sure that that route is actually feasible and helpful to use.

AI: That back-and-forth dynamic sounds really valuable - you're essentially using AI as a research partner but keeping yourself in the driver's seat to validate and refine the suggestions.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain aspects of your door-to-door sales work that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: i think im fortunate to work a sales job, as door-to-door sales is possibly the most personal job out there. i interact with hundreds of people a day and have to find common ground to break the ice with every single one of them. as a result, none of the actual meat of my job can be handled by AI, only the initial planning.

AI: That's such a clear distinction - the strategic preparation versus the human-to-human connection that is the core of what you do. It sounds like you've found a natural boundary where AI enhances your preparation but can't touch the actual relationship-building and persuasion that happens at each door.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do other people in door-to-door sales talk about using AI, or is this something you've developed on your own?

User: no from my experience it seems like a lot of sales professionals use AI for things like route planning, data synthesis, and time management

AI: So it sounds like AI use is fairly common among your sales colleagues for those behind-the-scenes tasks. That's helpful context.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: i dont think ive ever particularly felt overly satisfied or frusterated with AI. while it has helped me in work, it has not been life-changing, so i find to have a very balanced view on it as a whole

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - AI as a useful tool without being transformative. It sounds like you've found a practical, measured way to integrate it where it adds value without overhyping its impact.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, or does it not really concern you given the nature of your work?

User: AI cannot take over sales. sales is too personal of a job that needs human connection to thrive. no matter how sophisticated ai gets, it can never replace the feeling you get talking to another human

AI: That confidence in the irreplaceable human element of your work is really striking. You seem to have a clear sense of where that boundary lies.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll find new ways to use it, or do you expect it to stay pretty much in this supportive planning role?

User: i think it will stay pretty similar. i could absoltuely see me incorporating it more in the finance sector of my job and help me plan and budget my money

AI: That's interesting - expanding from territory planning into personal financial management. It sounds like you see AI's strength continuing to be in those analytical, data-processing areas that support your work rather than replacing the core sales interactions.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how clearly you've identified that natural boundary between AI's analytical capabilities and the irreplaceable human connection that drives your success in sales.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope im all set thanks for the time!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that practical balance with AI - using it for strategic planning while keeping the human connection at the center of your work - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
