Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes, that sounds good. No, no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: In my current role, I build customer account health score models to predict churn. I frequently use LLMs for optimize code, bounce ideas off of and ask questions regarding technical approaches and techniques

AI: That sounds like really interesting work. When you say you use LLMs to optimize code, what does that process typically look like for you? Are you sharing entire functions or smaller snippets?

User: Both. Sometimes it is smaller snippets, sometimes it is entire functions, or even entire notebooks. I also have access to Copilot within VSCode that has access to my repos

AI: That's helpful context. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: There are not any tasks in particular that I avoid using AI for. However, a lot of the time, things like querying our database would take more time to use AI due to having to explain database structure and nuances with the data.

AI: That makes sense - the context overhead can sometimes outweigh the benefit. When you do use AI for work tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I typically work in a collaborative manner with a lot of back and forth conversation. Sometimes, I will ask for a larger task, but I will just use the response as a "skeleton", make tweaks to the code and collaborate with the model during/after making those tweaks.

AI: That collaborative back-and-forth approach sounds really dynamic. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Yes. There is a very large push within my organization to utilize the AI tools we have available to us and to incorporate it into our day to day work.

AI: That's interesting that there's organizational encouragement. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Just recently I had a conversation regarding how to split up my contract level data so that it was organized on a day level for each contract as opposed to a snapshot at the end of the contract, as this might be more beneficial for predictions. An LLM helped me hash out the logic of the new code and offered some insights on how to improve. As far as frustration goes, there have been many times when the model is far too overconfident in its responses, even when they are incorrect. I think it would be beneficial if models outputted some sort of confidence code to let the user know how accurate the response may or may not be.

AI: That's a really insightful point about overconfidence. The example you shared about reorganizing your contract data sounds like a substantial conceptual challenge - having that logic conversation seems quite valuable. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think the act of actively coding will soon become obsolete. I think it is important to have a basic understanding, but between AI improvements and forums like Medium and Stack Overflow, I do not think a person needs to necessarily have all coding concepts memorized

AI: That's a fascinating perspective on the future of coding. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will become more and more engrained in everyones day to day work and those that are resistant to these changes may be left behind

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how coding itself might become obsolete while foundational understanding remains important, and your point about AI overconfidence being a real challenge.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's all

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative nature of working with AI, the organizational push for adoption, and especially your thoughts on the future of coding skills will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
