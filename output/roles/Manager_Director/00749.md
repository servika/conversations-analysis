Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, no questions, just ready to start.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI for time management to help me stay on task with projects because I usually have many going. Any work related emails are also helped by AI to make sure I am not being to wordy or over explaining.

AI: That's interesting - you're using AI for both organizational and communication tasks. 

Tell me more about how AI helps you with time management across multiple projects. What does that actually look like in practice?

User: I have a list of to do tasks, projects and their overviews. I use AI by asking for a time line for each project, how to create my day given the 8 hours I have and 5 day work week. It is helpful so I am not stuck working on too many things at once and giving me hour by hour break down with each part of the project. It really helps me stay on task without being overwhelmed.

AI: That sounds like a really structured approach. When AI gives you that hour-by-hour breakdown, do you find yourself following it exactly, or do you end up adjusting it as your day unfolds?

User: I try to stay on on task, there have been times when things have taken me longer that what AI thought they would so I have to adjust accordingly, but I usually have AI adjust to account for that time so it adjusts my day/week when needed.

AI: So you're having ongoing conversations with AI to recalibrate your schedule - that's a really dynamic way of working together. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to do most of the tasks myself honestly. I love the scheduling because sometimes I can be so scattered, but the actual tasks of my job are mine and I enjoy getting them done. Ai could help with a lot of my projects and outlining, but I feel like its cheating and also taking away from a personal touch.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making. When you say it feels like "cheating" - can you tell me more about that feeling? What is it about doing the actual work yourself that feels important to you?

User: It is personal. It isn't something automated or like everything else. I also get paid to do these things and I dont want AI to take that from me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - there's both a personal satisfaction and a professional security aspect to it. 

When you do use AI for things like email editing or scheduling, can you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it all the information upfront and let it handle it independently?

User: I give it all upfront and tweak it if it comes back with something that doesnt fit. It is not always accurate and needs help correcting especially since I give it so much info upfront

AI: So you're finding that even when you provide comprehensive information upfront, you still need to step in and make corrections. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do people talk about it openly, or is it something you mostly figure out on your own?

User: AI isn't really talked about, everyone uses it though, but its a personal choice how much we choose to use.

AI: That's interesting - there's this kind of quiet acceptance where everyone's using it but not really discussing it openly. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I think when I dont give proper details of exactly what I am wanting, it can focus on key things in my prompt and its frustrating because I need the whole prompt recognized not just certain aspects.

AI: That sounds frustrating - when it zeroes in on just part of what you need instead of seeing the full picture you're trying to convey.

Can you walk me through what that looks like? When you realize it's only focusing on certain aspects, what do you typically do next?

User: I will give it my whole week line up along with any appts I have and family things that may need to be recognized in my time commitments. If I overload it and tell it to include drive time and breaks or lunch, it will sometimes miss an appt or go over 8 hours knowing I said I can only clock 8.

AI: Ah, so it's struggling to juggle all those constraints at once - the appointments, family commitments, drive time, breaks, and staying within your 8-hour limit. It sounds like the more complete picture you try to give it, the more likely it is to drop something important.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I try to maintain all my skills even AI skills. I love to learn more about AI and how I can work with it not against it so it doesnt take over. I think people are more valuable and AI will always need people to interact or train so there's something useful about knowing it cant survive without us.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - viewing it as working with AI rather than against it, and recognizing that interdependence. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll expand how you use it, or do you see yourself sticking with the current approach?

User: I think it will evolve because it can be such a time saver, but only on things that dont directly need a personal touch, things that can be done automated.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on finding that balance between efficiency and maintaining the personal touch in your core work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think we covered a lot. Thank you

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working with AI as a scheduling partner while keeping ownership of your core tasks, and that balance between efficiency and personal value, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
