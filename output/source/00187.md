Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I don't have any questions

AI: Perfect, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a math tutor, and I use AI to come up with sample problems for students. I also use AI to research curriculum and plan lessons around them.

AI: That sounds like AI is playing a pretty integral role in your lesson preparation. When you're creating these sample problems and researching curriculum, what does that process typically look like for you? 

Walk me through how you might approach planning for an upcoming lesson.

User: For example, physics is a high demand subject for me, so if a student I am working with is starting AP Physics, I will research the curriculum to figure out what is in it. I will the using the learning objectives to come up with sample problems. A student who is just starting the class might be learning about kinematics and the fundamental equations, so I will prompt the AI to write some questions about that.

AI: That's a really clear process. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I don't like asking the AI to solve the problems because I like to think of ways to explain the process to students that might resonate with them and their learning style. I tend to always try to solve the problems myself to think of ways to guide the students.

AI: That's really interesting - so you're using AI to generate the problems but keeping the pedagogical work for yourself. Tell me more about that choice to solve the problems yourself rather than having AI work through them with you.

User: I feel like the process the AI uses to solve a problem might be different than the way a human would go about solving the problem. I feel that I like to create learning paths that reinforce the information rather than just going from point A to point B. Also, I feel like if a student is struggling to understand a concept, I should try to find a solution that resonates with them.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're really focusing on the human connection and understanding piece. When you are working with AI to generate those problems, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout that task, or do you tend to give it the full request and let it handle it independently?

User: I will typically start broad and ask it to generate around 10 practice problems for a topic such as kinematics. I then might start to refine the process by picking out the ones I think will be more helpful, and sometimes I might interject and ask it to come up with alternate problems that combine some concepts together.

AI: So it sounds like there's this back-and-forth refinement process happening. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are other tutors using it similarly, or have you developed your own approach?

User: I do not regularly interact with other tutors, but I imagine they are probably using it in similar ways. I know that some tutors will use AI to help them solve problems that they are struggling with, but I feel like this undermines the role of the tutor.

AI: That's a strong perspective about the tutor's role. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I typically feel satisfied when I feel that I have prepared well for a session. I feel that using AI helps me be extra prepared for each session I teach.

AI: That's great that AI contributes to that feeling of preparedness. Can you think of a specific instance where that really stood out to you - maybe a time when the AI-generated problems or curriculum research made a particular session go especially well?

User: I do not remember the intricate details, but I remember there was one lesson around when I first started using AI where I prepared a unit on Oscillations. I just remember I felt my preparation really knocked it out of the park for that session. I think in particular preparing for the specific terms such as amplitude, frequency, and simple harmonic motion.

AI: That's a great example of how the preparation paid off. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I feel like when it comes to tutoring and education in general, AI is less likely to take over completely. I feel that teaching requires a human element and sometimes creativity in order to get certain points across when students are struggling.

AI: That confidence in the human element of teaching is really clear in how you approach your work. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I do not see it changing much in the foreseeable future. The only way I am current expanding my AI usage is through daily planning.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on keeping the problem-solving and pedagogical work for yourself while leveraging AI for the preparation and planning aspects.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining that human connection in tutoring while using AI as a preparation tool will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
