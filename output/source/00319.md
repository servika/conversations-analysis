Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good and I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I teach 7th grade social studies in Alabama. I use multiple AI programs for many different tasks. I use AI to help me brainstorm lessons and lessons plans. I will provide the standards I need to teach and how long I have to teach it. I will ask the AI to help me create projects, lessons, assignments, quizzes, and group activities from the standards. At other times, I will use a program to create interactive slideshows for me from the standards. I have used it to help me figure out how to incorporate other subjects being taught in school into my lessons to help reinforce other learning happening in school. I also will have students write with a program where an AI evaluates their writing to provide real-time feedback.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated across many aspects of your teaching. 

Tell me more about that process where you provide the standards and timeframe to get lesson plans. How does that typically unfold for you?

User: I use the 7th grade Alabama standards from the ALSDE and I'll tell the AI I need to teach this content in a time frame, such as within 1 week. I tell it that on the first day, I need to deliver the core content. The second day, I might want to have students work in small groups to practice a skill that will help deepen their learning. For the third day, I want them to create something in their small group. They will finish the project on Thursday. I will also ask it to create a rubric for me. Then, I will ask it to create a final test or quiz for them to take on Friday to see how well they learned the content and skill. I try to avoid rote memorization based quizzes, so it will typically be something that involved application of knowledge and skills.

AI: That's a really detailed workflow you've developed. It sounds like you're giving the AI quite specific parameters about the structure and progression of learning.

When you get those lesson plans back from the AI, what do you typically do with them? Do you use them as-is, or do you find yourself modifying them in certain ways?

User: I rarely take them as it because I know what my students can and cannot do. The AI is tool that helps me brainstorm and develop ideas that I can modify based on the needs of my students and the skills I want them to develop. The AI doesn't know what I know about the kids, so it's almost always used as a start. I always have to fact check that the information presented is accurate. Sometimes I add things to the lesson and other times I have taken things out. The AI sometimes provides too much information, or explains things I don't need my students to know for what we are doing. I also tend to make the rubrics more specific to targeting what I need for class

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're using it as a starting point but applying your professional judgment about your specific students and context.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I handle data analysis on my own, and I don't have AI grade writing. I don't believe writing grades should always be objective. Instead, I focus on growth and development of a skill rather than the raw output. In data analysis, the AI doesn't know if the students experienced trauma that may impact them, or if there was a fire drill that reduced their time to assess. I also want to keep student data in the forefront of my mind, so if I outsource data analysis to a computer, I am less likely to remember how students are growing or performing. Students should just be numbers on a page, so I want to see and know the stories behind the numbers that represent students.

AI: That's a really thoughtful perspective - keeping the human stories behind the data front and center. It sounds like you've made deliberate choices about where to maintain that direct connection with your students' progress.

When you do use AI for those brainstorming and lesson planning tasks, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout developing a lesson, or do you tend to give it parameters and then take what it produces to work with on your own?

User: I will go back and forth with it. I tend to teach subjects over a week to 2 week period. If I am stuck and unsure of how to perform the task, I will start by telling if the length I have to teach it and the standards that need to be taught. I ask it to help me brainstorm projects and lesson ideas for engagement. I almost always have a starting point in mind and ideas, but I need help fleshing it out. Based on the responses, I will come back with the resources I have or do not have available in the room. If a task sounds like it requires too much time to prepare, I will ask it to change plans and tweak it. I will go back and forth with it, making minor adjustments, adding clarification, or adding new ideas as the brainstorming helps me come up with ideas. When I have a big idea, I might ask it to make me task cards, worksheets, write articles, or edit articles I have found to include in the lesson plan. Already this school year, I found a youtube video where I copied the transcript from the video, asked AI to remove the time stamps, turn it into a 1 page article, summarize the lengthy portions that were technical and jargon filled, and highlight portions of it I wanted my students to understand. I then had it translate the article to Spanish for my Spanish speaking students.

AI: That's a really rich collaborative process you've described - it sounds like you're having genuine back-and-forth conversations with the AI to refine and adapt ideas. The example with the YouTube transcript is particularly interesting - taking content and making it both more accessible and multilingual for your students.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at your school using it similarly, or are you navigating this more on your own?

User: A few of the teachers I work with rely on AI to grade for them, but the students have expressed frustration with it because the teachers don't always seem to read the feedback from the AI. They have been given poor feedback from AI telling them to do what they already did in the writing. Other teachers use it for brainstorming. My district is trying to restrict AI use for students to increase privacy and safety for our students. They are concerned about PII of these students being out on the internet with companies using their information. Most teachers I know use AI for lesson planning and brainstorming and grading

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like there's quite a range of approaches among your colleagues, and some real tensions around student use versus teacher use.

You mentioned students getting frustrated when teachers rely on AI grading without seeming to read the feedback themselves. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had my students use an AI called Class Companion. I was able to enter the writing prompt, insert a rubric, and give it direction on what it should do to help the students. It was set up to give feedback and a projected grade based on what I said. The AI scored students with perfect scores occasionally, but I would give it a much lower grade. I told the model what types of citations were needed and what they should look like, but the AI would give credit for incorrect citations. It would count evidence as reasoning, even though the entire paragraph was a quote. Instead of recognizing that a student submitted a multi-line quote, the AI would tell the student that they used great reasoning to prove their point.

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - the AI was essentially undermining your teaching goals by rewarding exactly the behaviors you were trying to help students move away from. It's giving them positive reinforcement for poor academic practices like over-quoting instead of reasoning.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do not consider that AI could take over my job. I know it has been speculated, but AI is a tool that is meant to be used in a correct way. As a teacher, I am trying to teach my kids to think critically, to analyze information, and to learn to efficiently and ethically use tools like AI to enhance their learning. An AI will not truly know a person the way I can as another person. AI is a program that follows rules set by people who have created code. AI may be extremely advanced and able to gather information faster than me. It may be able to explain things better than me. However, an AI cannot connect with a child emotionally after losing a loved one, while dealing with trauma, counseling after a breakup, celebrating a win or when overcoming a hurdle, teaching social skills, or giving a hug to let them know how appreciated and special they are. An AI cannot laugh with the students or create true emotional connections that are essential in learning skills and content that students find uninteresting.

AI: That's a powerful perspective - you're highlighting the deeply human, relational aspects of teaching that go far beyond content delivery. The emotional connections and social learning you're describing seem fundamental to what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as the technology develops, or as you become more experienced with it?

User: I will continue to use AI and try to find new ways to engage students in learning things. I will keep using it to come up with interactive lessons and projects that target various interests, skills, and abilities. I will allow it help me stay interactive and avoid falling back on the outdated lecture model of teaching. I will use it for brainstorming ways to teach new skills to develop students who are prepared for unknown challenges in the 21st century with an ever-evolving technologcally advanced world.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that human connection with students while using AI as a collaborative brainstorming tool - that balance between leveraging technology and preserving what's uniquely human about teaching.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: nope

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative brainstorming partner while maintaining the essential human elements of teaching will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've developed such a thoughtful approach to integrating these tools while keeping your students' individual needs and growth at the center of everything you do.

Have a wonderful rest of your day!
