Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, I have no questions

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Typically I use AI for information gathering, using it to find papers on a specific topic and extract key information from the papers and then link the papers so I dont have to spend my time sifting through irrelevant papers. I also occasionally use AI to write python script for graph making or data processing as this can often be labour intensive if done manually

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI to handle some of the more time-consuming research and coding tasks. 

When you mention using AI for information gathering and paper extraction, can you walk me through what that process actually looks like for you? How do you typically interact with the AI to get the results you need?

User: Sure. Typically I will begin by asking the AI a question such as "I am researching rapid protein evolution and require a comparison of different evolution methods, please list methods, how they have been used and how effective they are at mutagenesis, reference your source papers." I will then read the summarised information and if anything is immediately of interest I will read the referenced source paper or ask for further clarification on the topic until I find a paper of interest

AI: That's a clear process. It sounds like you're using AI as a starting point to navigate the literature, then diving deeper into specific papers that catch your attention.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to handle individual experimental data analysis myself but will use AI for larger less important data sets as I want to ensure that the data is being analysed correctly, such as spotting anomalous data points but this is less important for larger data sets where the accuracy of the data is less valuable.

AI: That's a thoughtful distinction you're making between different types of data analysis. It sounds like the stakes and precision requirements really influence when you keep control versus delegate to AI.

When you do use AI for work - whether it's the literature searches or coding or those larger datasets - could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I tend to collaborate with the AI, providing an initial prompt to direct the AI but then providing repeated adjustments as new information is provided and I wish to further investigate an area that either the AI has described or I have found independently. When working with coding and larger data sets I will collaborate with the AI and essentially proof read the output and input my improvements until I am happy with it and then let it run independently but double check the output.

AI: That collaborative approach sounds like a dynamic back-and-forth process. It's interesting how you maintain that oversight role throughout.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: They have as they also tend to collaborate with the AI to code programs or gather literature so observing them provide specific requests and always ask for sources has better informed me to do the same and to double check and the responses. They have also inspired me to use AI more as I was hesitant at first but they were able to compare and filter literature and data at a greater rate than doing it manually, making it a useful tool

AI: It sounds like your colleagues really helped you overcome that initial hesitation and showed you effective practices like always asking for sources. That peer influence seems to have been quite positive.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was frustrated when I was trying to find papers referring to a specific enzyme that I have some experience with, I wished to find papers discussing its activity and degradation products however the model kept providing incorrect information or hallucinating source papers, making the information difficult to confirm and unreliable

AI: That sounds really frustrating, especially when you have expertise in that area and can recognize when the information is off. The hallucinated sources would definitely make it hard to verify anything.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think it is important to maintain the skills as there are times where the AI is unable to find the information you desire, hallucinate it or is unable to notice a particular pattern such as paper authors. It is important to not lose these skills as while they are more time consuming, they are what you will fall back on if AI fails.

AI: That's a really practical perspective - keeping those skills as your fallback when AI doesn't deliver. It sounds like you've found that balance between leveraging AI's efficiency while maintaining your own capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I envision that I will integrate AI more into my work to better find relevant literature and perform further data analysis but I always want to collaborate with it as I do not think it is reliable enough to run a task without oversight

AI: That collaborative approach really comes through as a consistent theme in how you work with AI.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that oversight role and keeping your foundational skills sharp as a fallback.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thank you, I don't believe so no.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about that collaborative workflow, the importance of verification, and how workplace culture influenced your adoption will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
