Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I write both children's stories and picture books as well as how-to articles, short stories, and books for adults. I use AI more for my children's writing and for picture book design. I do use it for inspiration sometimes, but I use it more often for helping me come up with image ideas because I'm not an artist; I self-publish so being able to see images and work with those helps a lot.

AI: That's really helpful context - so you're working across different formats and audiences, and you're handling both the writing and visual aspects since you self-publish.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I have to split text so it spreads onto different pages for picture books. These are simple books, so the images have to say a lot. I can sometimes work with a few images created by AI and manipulate those or make changes to those to keep going with the story. The images also give me ideas for directions I can go and little tweaks I can make in the text.

AI: That's fascinating - so the images aren't just illustrating your existing text, they're actually feeding back into and influencing your writing process.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Right now I'm working on a PB that takes place in a zoo at night with several different animals that support the protagonist who finds himself in hot water beginning on page 1. For example, the MC is a hippo, and some of the supporting characters are a parrot, family of lions, family of monkeys, and a mouse. I've had this idea for a few years, and I even had someone work on the illustrations for it before, but I was not satisfied at all with what the artist came up with. On the other hand, the AI has came up with several really good ideas that have matched my vision of what I want this to look like, which is great! If only it could teach me how to draw the images :). That would be phenomenal because as I said, I am not an illustrator. If I was, then I could bring what's in my head to life better than what I can now. The AI does help a lot with pulling together elements that I need in the images; for example, in one image for this PB I needed the hippo drinking / gulping all of the water out of his watering hole. It took a few attempts, but I did get an image of him slurping up the water with a very full belly and mouth, which led me to thinking that an even better image would be him lying down with a huge belly, an almost empty watering hole, and an "I can't possibly take one more sip!" look on his face.

AI: That's a wonderful example of how the AI is helping you visualize your story in ways that match your creative vision - and I love how seeing that image of the hippo slurping water sparked a new idea for an even better scene.

When you're working with AI like this, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm driving the decisions. We're going back and forth with ideas, but ultimately I am deciding whether I like the results or need to shift direction or even start a new conversation.

AI: That sense of maintaining creative control while getting visual input is really interesting. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I don't have to spend as much time thinking because I have a teammate to help me ;) I still have final say so, but it takes less time to switch gears or make changes when I do have ideas.

AI: I love that you described it as having a "teammate" - that really captures the collaborative feel you mentioned.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I'm in writer's groups. A lot --and I mean a LOT --of writers have huge concerns over AI in writing and creative work. Not only are they worried that they will have something stolen, but they are worried about becoming obsolete. I can't say it doesn't worry me at all or that it hasn't crossed my mind, and I'd love to feel like I could just put a lot of my work into it without worrying about someone else accessing it. Guaranteed privacy would help a lot, but honestly, I've had writing stolen from me before AI was even around! I had an entire story stolen from a critique writing group member, who quit the group and got my story published about two months after quitting; the only way I found out about it was because she got it published at one of the children's magazines I had submitted it to, and the editor called me to let me know that they had an article that was almost identical, but with the character's names changed, that they were already publishing. When she gave me the person's name, I recognized them as a former member of the group. I've not shared complete pieces of work for critique since then, and I don't do it on AI either, but I wish I could. Getting total feedback with privacy would be very helpful. Beyond that, I only worry that a lot of JUNK will end up cluttering the market since so many people can use AI to create and self-publish. That makes it harder for publishers, editors, and readers to find the good stuff.

AI: That's such an important perspective - you've experienced theft firsthand, so you understand it's not just an AI issue, but the privacy concerns are still very real. And that point about market saturation making it harder to find quality work is really insightful.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I see myself continuing to use it, especially for image creation and manipulation, and possibly even for video creation that goes with my stories. I would love to be able to create entire works with images from creative outlines. That would be exceptional, especially for series.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative control while having AI as a "teammate," and how you balance the genuine benefits you're seeing with the very real concerns about privacy and market quality that you and your writing community are grappling with.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Not that I can think of. That's all.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative partner while maintaining creative agency, and your thoughtful perspective on both the opportunities and challenges facing writers today, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the practical benefits you're experiencing and the broader concerns in your field. Take care!
