Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I have several facets of creative work that I function in, but they essentially boil down to writing and audio engineering. For writing, my process is very flexible. I used to begin with an outline and then work my way through it chronologically, but lately I have been piecemealing sections of text together as they cross my mind. AI has been especially helpful for this latter technique. I also write eBay listing descriptions. For this, I used to cut and paste old descriptions into new listings and then change words as necessary, but AI has helped cut down this process significantly, especially when it comes to describing images based on the pictures. As for audio engineering, this process entail recording tracks of sound, mixing it and mastering it. AI has come to help me hone in on higher quality sound by making suggestions of how to sculpt audio per my intentions when I seem to hit a wall.

AI: That's fascinating - you're working across quite different creative domains. I'm curious about that piecemeal writing approach you mentioned.

Walk me through how AI fits into that process when sections of text are crossing your mind. What does that collaboration look like in the moment?

User: I have an ongoing conversation with a model that I will open. Per the initial system instructions, it knows to transcribe what I say, while cutting out artifacts like "uh" or "um" and keeping the grammar correct while changing as few words as possible and ideally no words at all. I use this method for prose projects. Later I will go to a desktop and copy the transcribed sections over to a master word document.  I also have used AI to flesh out the story for a script I am working on. Helping me hone in on details that can most realistically connect the story's events while firming up a solid order of events.

AI: That's a really interesting workflow - using AI as both a transcription tool and a story development partner. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Well I just described two writing projects where AI served as a transcriber, light editor and writing partner. As for audio, I recently mixed a live show and was having trouble getting the kind of definition I wanted. I described my tracking set up and the model gave me specific frequency cuts to make on specific tracks. This gave me the intended sound I was seeking and also taught me a new technique. This made me feel elevated, as though my expertise had increased, and with it my confidence.

AI: That's a powerful example - going from hitting a wall to learning a new technique and feeling more confident. It sounds like the AI helped you break through a specific technical challenge.

When you're working with AI, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: For transcribing and editing, I would describe the collaboration as strictly utilitarian. For organizing a story as for with audio, I would describe the collaboration as more of an exercise in curiosity. That is because, in these cases, I am usually already at a baseline performance and am just seeking to tighten it up. Ultimately the creative decisions are mine, but AI helps me better achieve the vision when I can't quite find the bridge from one idea to another. It's good for "honing in" above all.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - utilitarian versus curiosity-driven collaboration. I like how you describe AI as helping you "hone in" and find bridges between ideas.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: Like I said...when writing, I now do more piecemeal writing and assembling than plodding chronologically. The eBay listing writing goes much quicker. And for audio, I have more confidence in my abilities.

AI: Those are some concrete shifts in your process and confidence. It sounds like AI has given you more flexibility in how you approach your work.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I have no concerns about AI. I am not worried.

AI: That's interesting - you seem quite comfortable with AI's role. Tell me more about that perspective.

User: I'm not sure what else there is to tell. It seems to work just fine for me.

AI: Fair enough. Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I think it will come to work more coherently with larger packages of data. There is a bit of a limit now, especially when using it to transcribe and edit the prose. I can give it multiple sections at a time, but the model always fails to combine large numbers of these sections into a single piece I can download or cut out and paste. As a result, I currently have to manually cut and paste snippets at a time, which takes longer than it should.

AI: That makes sense - you're envisioning AI handling larger, more complex tasks rather than just the smaller pieces you're working with now.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your practical perspective on how AI serves as both a utilitarian tool and a curiosity-driven collaborator, and how it's changed your approach from chronological to piecemeal writing.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI across different creative domains - from transcription and story development to audio engineering - and especially your distinction between utilitarian and curiosity-driven collaboration, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about your workflow and the specific ways AI has enhanced your confidence and efficiency. Thanks again!
