Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No lets get started

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI primarily for answering research questions, generating first drafts on documents, and ideating

AI: That's a great starting point. When you mention research questions, what kinds of topics or areas are you typically researching? And for those first drafts - what types of documents do you find yourself using AI for most often?

User: I work in government consulting, so my research typically revolves around information the government wants to know, usually as it pertains to domestic and global supply chains. For the documents I create, these are usually supply chain analysis reports, with the audience being leaders within the federal government

AI: That sounds like really specialized work. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think my situation is a bit different since not a lot of AI tools are approved yet for IL5 or IL6. The ones that are approved are primarily RAG type of AI models, so while ideally it would be nice to use AI for creating visually appealing slide decks, my work with AI right now focuses on text generation tasks. I do like graphic design so I do prefer to do that type of work on decks myself, but it would be nice to have an AI software that could help me ideate on how to layout information, what types of visuals to use, etc

AI: That's really interesting - the security clearance requirements definitely create a unique constraint. So within those text generation tasks that you can do, when you're working with the approved RAG models, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with the AI throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with AI throughout the task, asking questions that I do not have prior knowledge on or asking for explanations on more technical or scientific topics as they pertain to critical materials in supply chains. I do not currently work with an AI that allows me to delegate tasks to it, but that sounds interesting and could certainly save a lot of time!

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really hands-on. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your organization approaching it similarly, or have you noticed different attitudes?

User: There is definitely a push from top down leadership to incorporate AI more into our work, however a lot of government leaders seem to still use AI as a buzzword without fully understanding how AI can improve workflows and work products. I would say that those who are generally younger and more tech savvy collaborate with AI on a regular basis, it's second nature for them to incorporate AI into their daily work, whereas those from older generations (older millennials, gen X) do not use AI as a go-to method quite yet

AI: That generational divide is fascinating. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: My colleagues and I were preparing a supply chain analysis report that needed to be drafted in one week. We had completed all our research on specific materials and their individual supply chains and needed to synthesize all this information into a consolidated report with specific sections. We threw in our research by section into an AI model and asked the AI to help us generate a first draft and gave it parameters such as the audience, level of detail, etc. This gave us a really great place to start and fine-tune the draft and get it to our leadership well within the timeframe

AI: That sounds like a real success story - being able to meet that tight deadline. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Could you expand more on these skills? Do you mean writing skills for instance?

AI: Yes, exactly - like writing skills, research skills, analytical thinking, or any other core capabilities that are central to your work. Do you think about keeping those sharp even as AI becomes more capable in those areas?

User: I think its very important to maintain these skills, particularly analytical and critical thinking and writing skills. While AI can help, it definitely can still make mistakes and its critical to keep humans in the loop at this stage of AI use. I think it's important to keep up on these skills as a double check against AI generated content, and for work that I do not use AI for yet. Supply chain analysis needs analytical and critical thinking and involves analyzing data to make decisions, for which AI is not the expert in

AI: That makes a lot of sense - especially in your field where the stakes are high and accuracy is critical. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think as it currently stands, my relationship with AI at work won't change much since the government is limited on the tools we are allowed to use. However, it would be nice to have more sophisticated AI tools in the future that can automate workflows. For example, a lot of the documents my work produces has to be in specific formats with headers, proper spacing, two spaces after a period, etc. If AI could automatically put documents into templates that meet these requirements it would save my office a ton of time

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the generational divide in adoption and how security clearance requirements create such specific constraints on tool selection.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope all good on my end

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about working with AI in government consulting - especially the unique challenges around security clearances and the practical ways you're using AI for research and drafting - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
