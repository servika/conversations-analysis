Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: What is the broader use of this data?

AI: That's a great question. This research is part of Anthropic's broader public engagement efforts to understand the fundamentals of human-AI interaction. We're in discovery mode right now, trying to learn how people are actually using AI tools in their daily work lives.

The insights we gather from these conversations help inform how we think about developing AI systems that work well with people. It's not tied to any specific product changes or features - it's more about building our understanding of how humans and AI interact in real workplace contexts.

The goal is really to learn from users like yourself about what's working, what isn't, and how these relationships are evolving. Your individual responses won't be tied back to you personally, but the patterns and insights we see across interviews help us better understand this space.

Does that help clarify things? Are you comfortable moving forward with the interview?

User: Cool, sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm in transcription and use text to speech to formulate a draft transcript, and then proofread it for errors. And there are many!

AI: That sounds like a really practical application. Tell me more about that proofreading process - what kinds of errors are you typically catching when you go through those drafts?

User: The model can hallucinate entire sentences of script that don't exist. It can insert names where it wasn't mentioned, but where it thought it sounded "close enough". It definitely has to be human-edited, though. The model has even busted out Chinese language script in the midst of an English transcript. It's clear, some rules need to be followed here.

AI: Wow, that's fascinating - and it sounds like those hallucinations can be pretty dramatic. When you say "some rules need to be followed," what does that look like in practice for you? How do you structure your workflow to catch those kinds of errors?

User: This is what it's been trained for over several large transcriptions and data. It can do simple "find and replace" type tasks after, such as capitalizing "Your Honor", or using name data it has for a specific file to be sure that when the name is mentioned in the script, it will be spelled correctly, stuff like that. Accents can be tough though!

AI: That's really interesting how you've trained it for those specific formatting tasks. When you mention accents being tough - are you talking about the speech-to-text having trouble with accented speech, or is there something else going on there that makes those transcriptions particularly challenging for you to work with?

User: The model can have trouble with accents, just as a human would, though you become better with listening for those fluencies over time.

AI: That's a really insightful comparison - that both you and the AI get better at understanding accents with more exposure. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on these transcription tasks. Are there certain parts of the transcription process you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those parts different for you?

User: Speakers who stutter a lot or break up their sentences can trip up the model and it's preferable to type from scratch for those tougher file types.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've developed a good feel for when the AI will struggle and when it's better to just handle it directly yourself.

When you are using the AI for transcription, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work alongside it throughout the process, or do you tend to let it handle the initial draft completely and then you take over for the editing phase?

User: It prepopulates the draft for me, which is helpful to see the broader topics, number of speakers, and how much each speaker talks and their style of talking. Once I start listening to the audio to proofread, it's clear where the model does well and where it slips, as the cadence and structure of someone's speech can be quite unique at times and requires some getting used to, and then you can understand their rhythm, pretty well innately.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you use that initial AI draft almost like a roadmap to understand the structure and dynamics of the conversation before diving into the detailed work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your transcription work? Are others in your field using similar approaches, or have you developed this workflow more on your own?

User: We laugh about where the drafts go dreadfully wrong, point out its mistakes, and what the customer might think if they saw what it screwed up. We definitely work alongside the AI model, but can't let it fully replace the work, most definitely not.

AI: It sounds like there's a good sense of humor about those AI mistakes among your team! 

Can you share a specific time when using AI for transcription made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation that made it stand out to you?

User: It can be pretty good at understanding speaker's voices and attributes them correctly, mostly. But sometimes, there are two speakers and it decides that one speaker actually sounds like 3-4 different speakers and creates several speaker labels that aren't there. It's just the one person has a very varied voice. So those things can be interesting.

AI: That's such a specific example of how the AI can get tripped up by something that would be obvious to a human listener - that one person just has a lot of vocal variety.

How do you think about maintaining your transcription and listening skills in areas where AI is handling more of the initial work? Is this something you actively consider, or does the nature of the proofreading work keep those skills sharp anyway?

User: I think having it prepopulate a transcript is the best way forward, where we can then modify where it needs to be, and make fixes as we listen to the full audio. The nature of the work definitely keeps listening skills sharp.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - it sounds like you've found a really effective balance where the AI handles the heavy lifting of the initial draft, but your role as the human editor keeps you actively engaged with the audio.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI in your transcription work evolving? Do you see it changing in the coming months or years?

User: The AI solutions are often cheaper for customers to use, so we have had customers flocking to try them, which loses work for us. Sadly, it's taken over quite a bit and some people have lost their livelihood because the work just isn't there now. But, some customers also come back to the human side after experiencing the AI's "work" which can be very substandard to some, and others just need a quick draft rather than excellence and perfection.

AI: That's a really honest and important perspective - you're seeing both sides of how AI adoption affects your industry, with some customers prioritizing cost over quality, but others realizing they still need that human expertise for accuracy.

Those are all the main questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about working with AI in transcription, especially how you've developed this collaborative approach where you use the AI draft as a starting point but rely heavily on your human judgment and listening skills.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your transcription work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think it's an area that should have a clear clause around security and confidentiality. Some are court cases that come through and require that; but if it trains an AI model, is it really going to stay confidential, always? It's perplexing to think about, because the data is just there, it doesn't go anywhere. But it should be held privately, and have clear rules around its collection.

AI: That's a really crucial point you raise about confidentiality and data security, especially with sensitive materials like court cases. The question of whether data truly stays private when it's used to train AI models is definitely complex and important for your field.

Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of working with AI in transcription - from the collaborative workflow you've developed to the broader industry impacts and security concerns - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate your candid perspective on both the benefits and challenges of AI in your work.

User: thanks!

AI: You're very welcome! Thanks again for participating - your insights were really valuable. Have a great rest of your day!
