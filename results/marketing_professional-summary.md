## Representative Insights

### How Marketing Professionals Use AI

1. "AI can be useful to come up for ideas for social media content and keep up with trends. I use it to brainstorm ideas occasionally. I also use it to proof read scripts for TikToks."
   *— From conversation 00018.md*

2. "AI definitely cuts down on planning and editing time. It helps a lot with coming up with ideas and editing the final product. Usually the bulk of the actual creation of content is done by me."
   *— From conversation 00018.md*

3. "In the marketing field, it is a little concerning how many jobs are going to be taken over by AI. I think it is important to learn to work with AI and use it to your advantage. There are still human skills that cannot be replicated by AI."
   *— From conversation 00018.md*

4. "I mostly use AI for content creation for my company's website and social media accounts for the purposes of marketing. I also will use AI to help organize the tasks I have each week and have on a couple of occasions used AI to brainstorm marketing ideas."
   *— From conversation 00102.md*

5. "I tend to decide what to focus on each week which I'm sure is something I could use AI to decide for me. I will write shorter pieces of copy on my own just because it's faster than writing out a prompt, getting a response, and then editing it. I also come up with the graphics to go with social media posts on my own. I have had AI generate ideas for graphics in the past but it was a lot of suggestions of using collages and in general not very good."
   *— From conversation 00102.md*

6. "Content creation such as newsletters and social media posts. I also use it for email drafts and to double check any work I have done for improvements/grammatical errors.
I have also used it to create elements of business plans, helping me to plan out next steps, generate new ideas for products etc."
   *— From conversation 00113.md*

7. "Yeah, when emailing existing clients I would definitely take on the writing for myself. Mostly because I want to know exactly what has been said and also each one is slightly different, so I do not feel there is much time saving if I have to coach the AI each time. That said I will use it to check for grammatical errors etc."
   *— From conversation 00113.md*

8. "I don't have colleagues as I am the owner/operator. However, I guess you could say that has influenced me to use AI more as it saves me time that I can then make use of elsewhere."
   *— From conversation 00113.md*

9. "I could see myself using it for more marketing tasks if there were specialised versions for, paid ads etc. I could also see it taking on some of the roasting once its underway as we use tracking software that can make the changes to temperature etc. so if it was integrated into that."
   *— From conversation 00113.md*

10. "Writing. AI can write but it isn't quite there yet. Reading AI content lacks the nuance of human written words. I can pick it out AI generated text very easily, and automatically I feel that it has less value - its a shortcut. It lacks that intentionality you mentioned above - like a factory pumping out cheap goods - no one wants this. So I ask the AI to help me with the outline and proofing, but the words are mine, they carry intention."
   *— From conversation 00149.md*

## Concerns & Challenges

1. "In the marketing field, it is a little concerning how many jobs are going to be taken over by AI. I think it is important to learn to work with AI and use it to your advantage. There are still human skills that cannot be replicated by AI."
   *— From conversation 00018.md*

2. "It doesnt really concern me. My main job is roasting and packing coffee so I do not see this being taken over completely by AI any time soon as it is too hands on. I could see how it could aid the coffee roasting side in the future though."
   *— From conversation 00113.md*

3. "I definitely don't want to over-rely on it! I still keep a fair balance of communicating my own thoughts, but the time spent writing is much less. I don't think it's negatively impacting my writing skills - I write prose here and there in my free time - but it helps elevate my level of concise communication (a skill I've never been super great at to begin with). I'm not concerned with it taking over in that area."
   *— From conversation 00161.md*

## Future Perspectives

1. "In the marketing field, it is a little concerning how many jobs are going to be taken over by AI. I think it is important to learn to work with AI and use it to your advantage. There are still human skills that cannot be replicated by AI."
   *— From conversation 00018.md*

2. "Provided it gets better at 'remembering' information and understanding time I would love to use it more for managing some of the planning and scheduling aspects of the job. Things like noticing that we haven't made a post about a particular topic in a while and it should probably be done soon, or my being able to give it dates of future events and then having it be aware of the current date and remind me about the event."
   *— From conversation 00102.md*

3. "It doesnt really concern me. My main job is roasting and packing coffee so I do not see this being taken over completely by AI any time soon as it is too hands on. I could see how it could aid the coffee roasting side in the future though."
   *— From conversation 00113.md*

4. "That depends on how it evolves, I can only gauge its capacity right now, and that we've already discussed. If it doesn't evolve, how I use it won't evolve. If it evolves, how I use it evolves - but I can't answer based on a future or evolution I don't know"
   *— From conversation 00149.md*

5. "Not really! As my role is incredibly broad, I don't think there will be a time where AI would take over my role. At the end of the day, someone still needs to monitor and control AI - I want to make sure I am that person."
   *— From conversation 00241.md*

6. "AI is advancing at such a rapid rate, it's hard to answer that question. I think it will become such an important part in my role that I'll collaborate with it more than my own team."
   *— From conversation 00241.md*

7. "Well, it hasn't changed much for my colleagues as it's a fast-food restaurant. My colleagues deal with the customers, and I am the only one who handles administrative tasks, so I am the one dealing with AI. I see in the future there is a potential to help my colleagues by integrating AI into the workflow. For example, I can integrate AI into online food orders, and AI can help us sort and group the orders that we should prepare together and send in the same direction instead of figuring it out ourselves by checking each address manually."
   *— From conversation 00272.md*

8. "I think it's definitely still useful to have skills in areas where AI might take over. At the moment it's not clear how good AI will get in the areas where I have professional knowledge, or how quickly it will get there, so it certainly makes sense to maintain skillsets even if at some point in the future, AI could take over."
   *— From conversation 00273.md*
