Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good. I'm curious about what we'll talk about.

AI: Perfect! I'm excited to hear your perspective. 

Let's start with the basics - could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm a freelance copyeditor, proofreader, and occasionally a writer. I have regular clients who give me work each week, and more sporadic bundles of work, too. I work mostly with nonfiction, short-form stuff for organizations, preparing blog posts and sometimes reports.

AI: That sounds like a really interesting mix of work! I can imagine each client probably has their own style and requirements too.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I don't use AI too much, to be honest. But sometimes I'll ask AI for help with a particular section that's giving me trouble. Like if a certain paragraph is reporting lots of data, this can be annoying to express smoothly, so I'll ask an AI for advice.

AI: That's really helpful to know - so it sounds like you're quite selective about when you bring AI in. 

Can you describe a specific recent example where you used AI for one of those tricky data-heavy paragraphs? What exactly did you ask for help with, and how did that go?

User: Sure thing. A specific example involves a blog post that was reporting participant ratings on a certain audio streaming service. This paragraph needed to include a wealth of ratings plus statistical information. I've anonymized it here, but something like "The mean rating for [service A] was 61.7, and for [service B] was 67.8; the difference was statistically significant ((t(104) = 2.28, p = .025). For [service A] the 95% confidence ranged from 58.2 to 68., and for [service B] it ranged from 66.7 to 76.1."

It's striking a balance between being casually readable and more technical. Some of the readers of this particular site's posts are just casual readers, and some are professionals who want the statistical context, so just cutting down on the numbers isn't really an option.

AI: That's a perfect example of the challenge you're dealing with - making technical content accessible without losing the precision that professionals need.

What specifically did you ask the AI to help you with for that paragraph, and how did it approach that balance?

User: I asked the AI, I think it was ChatGPT, how I make this more readable without removing any of the numbers. It first suggested using a table, which I think is an OK suggestion, but we rejected it ultimately since that particular blog post already had a couple tables. So instead it said to use a couple bullet points, one for Service A, and one for Service B, and putting the significance information immediately below.

AI: Interesting - so the AI gave you some structural options to work with. 

How did that suggestion feel to you as an editor? Did you end up going with the bullet point approach, or did you take it in a different direction?

User: I went with the bullet points, as that was easily readable while still containing all the information needed.

AI: That sounds like it worked out well. When you're working with AI in situations like this, how would you describe that collaboration? Are you mostly looking for it to offer structural solutions, or does it feel more like a back-and-forth creative process?

User: There's is not often a lot of back and forth between me and the AI. I give it a problem, it suggests a potential solution; I think about the solution, and accept or reject it. Usually I don't iterate on the problem, though I might ask for help with similar problems down the line.

AI: That's a really clear way to put it - sounds like you're using AI more as a consultant you check in with rather than an ongoing collaborator.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI, even if it's just occasionally like this?

User: It's changed my "polish" stage a little. Usually my first run at a piece of work is just me and myself working at it. Then the second run is when I get more technical, using reference books and AI. I will say it has saved me some embarrassment a couple times, catching typos for me!

AI: That's really insightful - so AI has become part of your quality control toolkit during that second, more technical pass. 

Tell me more about those times it caught typos for you. What kinds of things was it picking up that you might have missed?

User: I call them stealth typos, when you misspell a word so it looks like a different word, so a typical spell checker wouldn't catch it. The other day ChatGPT asked if meant to say "there" instead of "three" for example. And sometimes it helps me correct regional spelling, as I'm [REDACTED] and most of my clients are in the US.

AI: Ah yes, those stealth typos are the worst! And the regional spelling issue is such a practical consideration - that must be really helpful to have that second eye on [REDACTED] versus American conventions.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field of editing and writing?

User: Privacy is a concern. Sometimes the things I edit has proprietary trade names and data, and I don't want to put that "out there." And sometimes the AI makes suggestions that don't make a lot of sense, so I can't dispense with my own judgment.

AI: Those are both really practical concerns. The privacy issue especially makes sense given you're working with client materials that might be sensitive.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years? Do you think you'll be using it more, or in different ways?

User: I suspect AI will continually get better at grammar and style. Hopefully not good enough to obviate my job, but I suspect that may be unlikely; there's enough sloppy grammar in all writing, including an AI's training data, that sensible organizations will always have a person in the loop.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - the idea that human judgment will remain essential, especially given the variability in the quality of source material AI learns from.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful thoughts about your selective but strategic use of AI in your editing work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI fits into your "polish" stage and your point about organizations needing to keep a human in the loop.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Yes; the word "data" is plural and I will die on this hill.

AI: Ha! I love that - there's nothing like a good grammar hill to die on. That's exactly the kind of editorial judgment and expertise that no amount of AI training is going to replace.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI strategically for specific challenges while maintaining your professional judgment will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.
