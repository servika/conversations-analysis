" what do you think they're most uncertain about? Is it more about not knowing what AI can do, or concerns about what might go wrong?

User: I think it's a combination of the two elements - their exposure so far has been limited to people telling them about how AI helped them re-design their garden, or helped their child with a school project, so they find it hard to see how it can translate to help us with what we do. Then there is the worry that AI cannot know everything that we know and so they will have to get involved anyway.

AI: That's fascinating - so there's this gap between the consumer uses they've heard about and seeing the professional applications, plus that same concern you mentioned about still needing to verify everything anyway.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Recently, I tried using AI to generate an invoice for a customer. The next day, they emailed to say that the type of service they had asked for was different to what they had received, according to the invoice. This was frustrating, because the customer had received what they had asked for, but the AI invoice had just used the standard information, whereas if I had generated it myself, I would have tailored it to the customers expectations, avoiding any complaints.

AI: That's a perfect example of what you were describing earlier - where AI missed those nuanced details that you would have naturally included. It sounds like you understand not just the technical aspects of what was done, but also how to frame it in a way that matches the customer's mental model of what they requested.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I do worry sometimes that roles like mine could be made obsolete by AI, but I also think that it will be many years before that happens, due to situations like the one above. I have considered growing my skillset to include more technological capabilities, but haven't decided on which route to take yet.

AI: That balance between recognizing the potential threat but also seeing the current limitations is really thoughtful. It sounds like you're in this interesting position where you can see both AI's capabilities and its current gaps pretty clearly.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will continue to use it for the tasks we know it can do well (such as emails to customers) and I will probably use it more frequently for this than I do now. But I also think that some elements such as invoicing will remain a person specific activity to ensure accuracy.

AI: That makes perfect sense - leaning more into what's already working well while maintaining human oversight where accuracy is critical.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how trust and verification needs vary so much depending on the task and the stakes involved.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I think I've shared everything relevant.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the nuanced differences between tasks - where AI works well versus where human expertise is still essential - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear your perspective, especially as someone navigating AI adoption in a workplace where you're somewhat of a pioneer. Thanks again!
