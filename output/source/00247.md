Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine.  I'm good to go!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't really use it that often.  I work for the Canadian federal government as a GST/HST auditor and most of my day involves writing reports, letters, and making phone calls.  The only times I would really use AI would be when doing research for a file and using Google search about tax law or about a type of business.

AI: That's interesting that you use AI mainly for research through Google search. When you're doing that research on tax law or business types, what does that process typically look like for you? How do you go about using AI in those research moments?

User: Perhaps I have a situation where I need to determine where GST/HST is applicable on a type of supply or I wish to learn more about a business I'm auditing.  I recall one time that I searched for a business name (cannot say which one due to confidentiality) and got a brief paragraph that summarized their history and directed me to their website.

AI: That sounds like a helpful way to get oriented with a business quickly. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Most of the tasks that i do I prefer to do myself to be honest.  Whether it be writing my reports, drafting my letters, etc.  Mainly because I have been doing this job for over 10 years now and I've gotten into a bit of a routine with how I draft things and am able to acclimate my wordings to various situations.  I love using AI for research but when it comes to actually writing these reports, I prefer to do it myself mainly because i feel the work needs that human touch (plus its what I was hired to do).

AI: That makes a lot of sense - having that 10 years of experience and your own style really comes through. When you do use AI for research, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to have a back-and-forth conversation with it throughout your research, or do you tend to ask it something specific and then take that information to work with independently?

User: I almost never go back and forth.  Its usually I search for one topic/phrase and go off what is provided (although sometimes I may re-word it a bit and then try again if what was provided does not seem right).

AI: That's a pretty straightforward approach - get what you need and move on. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Not a lot really.  AI doesn't come up in conversation very often.  I think most of them are in the same boat as me.  The only time my co-workers mention AI is how they use it during their personal time.

AI: Sounds like it's still pretty individual rather than something your workplace is actively discussing. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There was one time where I was reviewing a really old return (over 6 years I think) that was sent in quite recently (yes, that does happen).  I was trying to remember what the GST/HST rate was in a particular province during that time.  Rather than search through multiple areas of the web to try and find the tax rate, I did the Google search and read what the AI summarized at the top and found it be accurate.  It saved me a bit of time and I was quite satisified then.

AI: That's a great example of AI cutting through what could have been a time-consuming search through multiple sources. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't really consider that to happen anytime soon.  I feel like in my role, human judgment is very important and unlikely to be affected by AI.  I'd be okay if we were given permission to have AI draft parts of our letters or reports to save time though.

AI: That's an interesting distinction - being open to AI helping with drafting while still valuing that human judgment aspect. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Kind of similar to what I just shared.  I feel that as AI grows and becomes more trained, it could become even more useful in my workplace.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on valuing that human judgment and experience you bring after 10 years, while still being open to AI helping with efficiency in areas like drafting.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No I think I'm good.  Thanks.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how AI fits into specialized government work like auditing, and that balance between maintaining human judgment while being open to efficiency gains, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
