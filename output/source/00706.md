Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, I'm fine. Let's get started

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I'm a film critic so I do a lot of writing. Both movie reviews and essays/blog posts/articles. I write these myself but since I no longer have a human editor, I have been using AI to do proofreading and sometimes help when I'm having difficulty with awkward sentences. My process is that I submit something to AI, ask for proofreading, then decided on a case-by-case basis what to accept and what to reject.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI as a kind of editorial partner. When you're deciding what suggestions to accept or reject from the AI's proofreading, what goes through your mind in that decision-making process?

User: I compare the AI's output with my original text and decide based on two things: (1) Do I think it generally sounds better (better vocabulary, sentence structure, etc.) and (2) Do I think it matches my "voice." A great sentence might not be a good match if it doesn't blend seamlessly.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - balancing technical improvement with maintaining your authentic voice. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I'm reasonably comfortable with using the AI as an editor or having it lookup synonyms. But I still do all my own research. The reason is simple: I don't trust AI research to be 100% factual and it would be embarrassing if I had a reader contact me and tell me something wasn't correct because I trusted the AI.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - accuracy is crucial for your credibility as a critic. 

When you do use AI for editing and proofreading, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout a piece, or do you tend to send it a complete draft and work with what it gives you back?

User: I send the review through on a paragraph by paragraph basis. For example, today I wrote a retrospective of "The Big Lebowski." The first paragraph was:

If I were to rank *The Big Lebowski*, I'd place it in the upper-middle tier of the Coen Brothers' catalog. It remains one of their most oft-quoted works and arguably their biggest cult classic. A showcase of offbeat humor—some of it genuinely laugh-out-loud funny—it's a warped, irresistibly entertaining caper comedy that delivers a couple of hours of guilt-free fun, crafted as only the Coens can do.

So I sent this paragraph through, asked the AI to proofread it, then incorporated some of the changes and rejected others. I then moved on to the second paragraph and so on until the review was done.

AI: That's a really methodical approach - working through it paragraph by paragraph rather than doing the whole piece at once. It sounds like that gives you more control over the process.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned you no longer have a human editor, I'm curious about how other film critics or people in your field are approaching AI tools.

User: There's a lot of skepticism about AI in film criticism. One fear is that AI will eventually write all reviews, replacing humans. There's also a belief that using AI is somehow "cheating" - that you aren't really writing the review yourself. I don't ascribe to that because the review is still mine; I'm simply using an available tool to improve the product.

AI: That tension between embracing helpful tools versus concerns about authenticity sounds challenging to navigate. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: There have been times when AI has deviated too far from my tone and even changed the meaning of some of what I wrote. This necessitated having a detailed conversation explaining what I was looking for. That took a lot longer than it should have taken. Normally, I expect to spend 50 minutes writing a review and 20 minutes editing it. For this review it was 50 minutes writing, 15 minutes instructing the AI what not to do, and another 25 minutes editing. Admittedly, that was an isolated case. Most of the time, it goes seamlessly and, on those occasions, I feel that my using the AI as an editor resulted in a better review.

AI: That's a vivid example of how the interaction can vary so dramatically - from seamless collaboration to something that actually adds time to your process.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: If the AI learned to effectively capture my voice in longer form, I'd be happy to take a step back and provide more of a skeleton of the review and let the AI do some of the heavy lifting. But it's not there yet. I have played around with this and the results aren't pretty.

AI: That's fascinating - you seem open to letting AI take on more of the writing if it could truly capture your voice, but you've tested those boundaries and found the limits.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think collaboration is the key. I would never want to remove myself from the process or give the AI too much control. The opinion is mine. The reasoning is mine. And there are times when I enjoy simply writing. But I'm not intimidated by letting the AI help out. I would hope that as AI becomes more advanced, I will be able to gradually cede more of the nuts-and-bolts writing to it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining ownership of your opinions and reasoning while being pragmatic about using AI as a collaborative tool.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Just that I'd love to be able to use the AI to provide me with all the necessary background information (right now, I typically use imdb.com and Wikipedia as first sources but often branch out to others). That's something that would really reduce the busy work. But, as I said, 100% truthfulness is necessary for me to take that step.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the potential for AI to streamline your research process is clearly appealing, but the accuracy requirement is non-negotiable in your field. That tension between efficiency and reliability seems to be a key consideration for how you might expand your AI use in the future.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about balancing collaboration with maintaining your authentic voice, and your practical approach to testing AI's limits, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

User: Thanks. I think we're done.

AI: Perfect! Thanks again for participating. Have a great rest of your day!
