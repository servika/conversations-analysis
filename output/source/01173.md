Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great, Claude. Let's go!

AI: Wonderful! Let's dive right in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a screenwriter and my project usually involves writing a feature length screenplay, revising a screenplay, collaboration with others on co-writing scripts, perhaps writing short scripts (fewer than 20 pages). Last year I sold two animated short scripts. I also do standup comedy, so another creative project I would do would be to write a set that would be delivered anywhere between 5-15 minutes in length. Finally, I'm thinking about adapting one of my favorite screenplays into a novel (but I haven't done that yet).

AI: That's a really diverse range of creative work! It sounds like you're working across different formats and mediums, from feature screenplays to short animated scripts to live performance with standup.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: With standup, I have inputted parts of my set into AI to help me brainstorm ways to extend a joke, or do call-backs from jokes earlier in my set. Recently, I used AI extensively to come up with many angles on the theme: women over 50 are invisible in society. 

As for my screenplays, I've primarily used it to do character building: quickly access popular names of people of a specific generation, or even quickly understand what their personalities could be based on their enneagram number.

AI: That's really interesting how you're using AI for different types of creative support - joke development and callbacks for standup, and character development for screenwriting. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: Like I said, the most recent one that comes to mind is I was working on a standup set where I wanted to talk about how women over 50 are invisible. I asked AI to provide me with some possible answers to "I'm so invisible..." It provided me one that I partially used: "I'm so invisible, even my Apple watch didn't record my steps." I used that answer, but then added (after a beat): "I mean, I don't exercise, but still!"

AI: That's a great example! I love how you took the AI-generated line and made it your own by adding that personal twist at the end - "I mean, I don't exercise, but still!" That really shows your comedic voice coming through.

When you're working with AI like that, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I am definitely driving the creative decisions. I know my own voice, but I like to get ideas. It's like using the old books like "PEN ON FIRE," where you're given story prompts, but you create the story. That's how I like to use AI. That above example was the only time I actually used an actual answer from AI (and then I still had to add to it).

AI: That's a really helpful analogy - AI as a prompt book rather than a co-writer. It sounds like you see it as a starting point for your own creativity rather than something that's actually creating the content.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: I save a lot of time on research because I usually get answers in seconds, instead of having to jump around from website to website to get the info I need. (I imagine it was a lot harder to do research pre-internet, right?)

AI: Absolutely - the research efficiency makes total sense! That's a practical benefit I hadn't fully considered.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: I honestly don't have too many concerns because although people are trying to pass off AI as their own work (like flooding Amazon with self-published books), only good, authentic work will rise to the top. I have been telling my writer friends for a few years now that AI will change the market to be more focused on memoir-type work, which is something AI can't duplicate. Every person's story is unique and only that person can tell that story. The other thing that AI can't do is create humor very well. (Sorry, Claude.) I've yet to find truly funny material from AI - it's always a lot of old Dad jokes. So I think if someone has a unique "voice," and are funny, they'll be okay.

AI: No offense taken at all! That's actually a really insightful observation about AI's limitations with humor - and it aligns with what you showed me earlier about taking that AI suggestion and adding your own comedic twist to make it actually funny.

Your point about memoir-type work and unique personal stories is fascinating. It sounds like you see AI as potentially pushing the creative field toward more authentically human experiences.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: My hope for it is for the more "boots on the ground," practical stuff. Like I want my AI to be able to take one of my screenplays and send it back to me as a novel. Then I want it to be able to revise it so it's in first person. Then revise it to third person so I can compare. Then I might ask it to change the main protagonist to a person who was formerly a supporting character to see what happens. I wouldn't expect the output to be refined, but I could get a lot of ideas from going through this process. The other way I want to use AI is for marketing. I want AI to read my novel and provide me a list of literary agencies that want what I write, and provide me comps on similar works that are already doing well in the marketplace. These are things I have to sell in my cover letter, and the research can be time consuming. I'd like my AI companion to be my personal manager/agent in this regard.

AI: That's such a compelling vision - AI as your personal creative assistant and business manager rolled into one! I love how you're thinking about using it for format experimentation and perspective shifts, not to replace your creative judgment but to help you explore different versions quickly.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI might push the market toward more authentic, personal storytelling - and your practical vision for AI as a research and formatting tool rather than a creative replacement.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think I covered it, and I really appreciate your time and consideration, Claude. You are the bomb diggity!

AI: Thank you so much - that's very kind of you to say! And thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about AI as a research tool, your thoughtful perspective on authenticity and voice, and especially your vision for practical AI assistance in formatting and market research will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

It's been a real pleasure talking with you about your work. Best of luck with your screenwriting, standup, and that novel adaptation project!

User: Thanks, Claude. I hope this project provides you with great insights and valuable contributions...

AI: Thank you so much! Your contributions have been incredibly valuable - you've given us such a clear picture of how a creative professional can thoughtfully integrate AI while maintaining creative control and authenticity. Your insights about AI's strengths in research and formatting, its limitations in humor and personal storytelling, and your vision for practical creative assistance will definitely inform our understanding of human-AI collaboration.

I really appreciate how open and detailed you were in sharing your experiences. It's been genuinely enlightening to hear your perspective!
