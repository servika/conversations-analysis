Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That works, I don't have any questions right now

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Usually I only use AI to help me write treatment plans for clients in a therapeutic setting. I often provide AI with a therapy goal and ask it to generate examples of objectives to use for those goals.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're working on these treatment plans, can you walk me through what that process looks like? How do you typically interact with the AI when you're asking it to generate those objective examples?

User: Usually I will come up with my own treatment goals based on a client's diagnosis. I will send the goal without using the client's name to maintain confidentiality then I will ask AI to give me examples of objectives to use for those goals. Here is an example) provide potential objectives for the therapy goal of alleviating symptoms of anxiety

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you've developed a clear process for maintaining confidentiality while getting the support you need. 

When you receive those objective examples from AI, what happens next? Do you typically use them as-is, or do you find yourself modifying them to fit your specific client's situation?

User: I sometimes add more information, but often I can use the objectives as is

AI: That's interesting that they often work directly. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI in this context. Are there certain aspects of the treatment planning process that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those parts different for you?

User: I usually like to collaborate with clients to create goals together. I never really ask AI to come up with goals for a treatment plan even though I know it could manage this

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you're making. What is it about that goal-setting process with clients that feels important for you to keep as a collaborative human experience rather than involving AI?

User: I just feel like this is more central to the purpose and outcomes of therapy and I want to be more involved in this process.

AI: That really highlights how you think about what's core to your therapeutic work. When you do use AI for the objectives, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it to refine the suggestions, or do you tend to give it the goal and let it generate a complete set of objectives for you to review?

User: I sometimes ask for more examples with more objective measures if the responses are too vague. It will often provide five or six examples and I will chose two or three to either edit or use as is

AI: It sounds like you've found a workflow that works well for you. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your therapeutic setting using AI similarly, or differently?

User: Some colleagues use AI to write their notes or assist with writing notes. I feel like people in my setting use AI more than I do.

AI: What's your sense of why others in your setting might be using AI more extensively than you? Is there something that holds you back from expanding your use, or does your current level feel right for your practice?

User: Some will take notes during session and use AI to take their notes and make them into complete therapy notes. I feel like I don't know the best way to use AI and maintain confidentiality at the same time or I would use it more

AI: That confidentiality concern makes a lot of sense given the sensitive nature of your work. Can you share a time when using AI for those treatment objectives made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Sometimes the responses are really vague or limited, but usually it's okay if I ask follow up questions so I can't think of any times I felt frustrated. I am very satisfied when AI generates measurable objectives.

AI: That's great that you've found ways to work through any initial limitations. You mentioned feeling satisfied when AI generates measurable objectives - what makes those particularly valuable for your work?

User: They just feel more easy to measure and monitor client's progress with

AI: That makes perfect sense for tracking therapeutic outcomes. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your practice?

User: I'm not worried about AI taking over my role. I talk and empathize with people for a living

AI: That's a really grounded perspective on what makes your work uniquely human. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you might expand how you use it, or do you see it staying pretty much as it is now?

User: If I use AI more I think I'll be able to spend less time on documentation and more time meeting with people

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on keeping the goal-setting collaborative with clients while finding value in AI for the more technical aspects like generating measurable objectives.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think we covered everything

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance using AI as a tool while preserving the human-centered aspects of therapy will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate how thoughtfully you've approached integrating AI into your practice while maintaining your professional values around confidentiality and client collaboration.
