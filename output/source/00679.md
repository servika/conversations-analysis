Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready to go

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work as a private tutor, math mainly, but I help out in other classes also. I don't use AI every day, but there are a few main things that I use it for:
* composing messages to parents. I have a hard time not sounding abrupt, so I use AI to create a message that sounds more human than I do
* coming up with activities that focus on a particular topic. For example, I had a 6th grader and I had to go over some of the basics, such as times tables, fractions, powers of 10, etc. I also have a hard time keeping her attention, so worksheets weren't going to cut it. I used AI to come up with games and other hands-on/active activities
* I do sometimes use it to figure out how to solve a problem when my brain freezes

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI helps you in some very specific ways. I'm particularly curious about that first point you mentioned, about composing messages to parents. 

Can you tell me more about what that process looks like for you? How do you typically work with AI to craft those messages?

User: Generally I copy the message that the parent has sent to me then I explain to the AI that I'm looking for a response to the message and I state what I want the message to convey. Then I explain the tone I'm looking for. Generally I say something along the lines of, "I just want to say X, but I don't want to sound rude. Can you write a response to their message that sounds friendly, but not overly-exuberant. Matter-of-fact, to-the-point, but friendly."

AI: That's a really detailed approach. When you get that response back from AI, what happens next? Do you typically use what it gives you as-is, or do you find yourself editing it before sending?

User: Sometimes I can use the message as-is, other times I might have to edit it to insert names and such, other times I'll ask for the AI to revise it if it's too far off base.

AI: That makes sense. You mentioned that you have a hard time not sounding abrupt - I'm curious about your experience on the other side of this. When you do send those AI-assisted messages, how do parents typically respond? Have you noticed any difference in how your communications are received?

User: I can usually fake it on my own, because I know how I can sound, and since the parents only interact with me a little, I know that it could be taken the wrong way. I usually turn to the AI if there's some sort of tricky situation. For example, there was this one time that I was trying to arrange a time with a parent, and I was explicit about what day or time I was available. I don't remember exactly, but it was something like, "I'm not available at all on Tuesday, but I can meet on Wednesday any time after 4pm," and the response I got back was, "Will 1pm on Tuesday work?" So I want to respond, "No, as I said, I am not available at all on Tuesday, 1pm or any other time," but that would be too much, and I'd lose a client.

AI: That's a perfect example of a tricky communication situation. So in that specific case with the scheduling mix-up, how did you end up handling it with AI's help? What did that final message end up looking like?

User: The AI was able to put it diplomatically. I was just dumbstruck with the parent's response. I had to look back at my own message to make sure I wasn't going crazyl.

AI: I can imagine how frustrating that would be! It sounds like AI really helped you navigate that diplomatically when you were feeling stuck.

Thinking about the other ways you use AI - like creating those hands-on activities for your 6th grade student - are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I make a lot of graphs on Desmos. I suppose that I could find some way to use AI with those, but I enjoy it, and incorporating AI would be probably more trouble than its worth.
When I use AI to come up with activities, it's because I'm a book learner. You give me a math book, and I'll read the lessons and work through the problems. I don't need to play games to keep my interest, so my mind doesn't think like that. I use AI to brainstorm ideas that I wouldn't necessarily come up with on my own.

AI: That's a great distinction - keeping the tasks you enjoy while using AI to expand your thinking in areas that don't come as naturally. 

When you do use AI to brainstorm those activity ideas, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout developing an activity, or do you tend to ask for complete activity suggestions that you can then implement?

User: The most successful experience I had was when I needed a game to practice multiplication. The game that the AI came up with at first wasn't perfect, so we went back and forth and came up with a game that kept her interest for an hour. I had multiplication flash cards, and dealt each of us 5 or 7 cards. Then we each rolled a die to combine into a 2-digit number. We would have to try and "play" our card that equalled the number closer to the number from the dice.

AI: That sounds like a really engaging collaborative process that led to a successful outcome. It's interesting how you worked together to refine the initial idea into something that actually worked well for your student.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you work as a private tutor, I'm curious about whether you interact with other tutors or educational professionals who might have different approaches to AI.

User: I'm pretty much on my own. I could talk to my boss if I need help, but I don't do that very often. I turn to AI when I need advice. I've had a few ADHD kids that I've asked for advice about, and there's a kid with an input disorder or something like that, so I just ask what I can do to help them out the most

AI: That's really valuable - using AI as a resource for understanding how to better support students with different learning needs when you don't have colleagues readily available to consult with.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: No frustration really, but the most satisfied is with some of the projects that I've come up with. With one kid, we calculated the volume and floor areas of the Sears tower and the Pentagon

AI: That sounds like a really creative way to make math concepts tangible and interesting! It's clear that AI has helped you develop some engaging projects.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: AI will take over all my jobs. I'm a tutor and a software developer. Most of what I do now will be handled by AI, and my role will change. I'll still be a part of it, I don't know how, but AI will be doing most of the "work" that I do now.

AI: That's a pretty significant perspective - accepting that AI will fundamentally change both of your roles. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? You mentioned you'll still be part of it somehow - what do you think that might look like?

User: Depending how quickly it advances, who knows? but assuming there aren't any major breakthroughs, just steady advancement, AI will continue to be more of a tool, rather than an autonomous actor, so I will continue to use it in the same way, but it will require less effort and supervision. For example, instead of composing a message together, the AI would know what tone I prefer when interacting with parents, and I could just say, "Tell them 5pm is fine" and the AI will turn that into a friendlier sounding message and send it off for me."

AI: That's a really thoughtful vision - AI becoming more seamlessly integrated and personalized to your communication style and preferences.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about how you use AI as both a communication tool and a creative partner in developing engaging activities for your students. I particularly appreciated how you described that collaborative process of refining the multiplication game - it really illustrated the back-and-forth nature of working with AI effectively.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, that's it. Thank you!

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about using AI as a communication aid, creative brainstorming partner, and resource for supporting diverse learners have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today. Have a great rest of your day!
