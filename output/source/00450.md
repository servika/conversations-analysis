Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: I don't

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it mainly to for writing correspondence such as emails, messages and letters. I also use AI to write longer documents such as proposals or other similar documents.

AI: That's helpful to know. When you're using AI for writing these different types of documents, can you walk me through what that actually looks like? For instance, when you're working on an email versus a longer proposal, how does your process differ?

User: If I'm using AI to write an email, I will write a detailed prompt for what I want it to convey. For example, I will ask AI to write an email to my team thanking them for how they prepared for and delivered a large training program. When I am writing a proposal I will generally write up a bit of the proposal and then have the AI clean it up and make it better. I will explain what the goals of the proposal are in the prompt.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction in how you approach different types of writing tasks. It sounds like with emails you're starting from scratch and delegating the full writing to AI, while with proposals you're doing some of the initial work yourself and then having AI refine it.

What drives that difference for you? Why do you handle emails and proposals so differently when working with AI?

User: I believe it's because there are certain ideas that I want to include in the proposals and it's harder to explain those in the prompt. Proposals are usually more in depth and have things that need to be included, whereas the emails are a little more flexible and I am more willing to let the AI use its judgement.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - the complexity and specificity of proposals would make them harder to fully capture in a prompt. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different from the writing work you delegate or collaborate on?

User: Generally, I am open to delegating most work to the AI. I think the only tasks that I prefer to handle myself are ones that must be done in a very specific format or style that have to be done exactly as told.

AI: So it sounds like format and style precision is where you draw the line. Can you give me an example of one of these tasks that has to be done exactly as told? What happens when those specific requirements come into play?

User: There are certain work documents that are forms with different sections that have to be completed in a very detailed manner. Sometimes these forms are also on a proprietary or separate system from the AI. That requires cutting and pasting which makes the process cumbersome and less efficient.

AI: That paints a clear picture - those proprietary systems and the back-and-forth cutting and pasting would definitely make the process more cumbersome.

When you do use AI for work, I'm noticing you mentioned two different approaches - sometimes delegating complete tasks like emails, and sometimes collaborating through the writing process like with proposals. Overall, which pattern do you find yourself using more often - collaborating with AI throughout a task, or delegating complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: Delegating tasks. I will also review them afterwards. So there is some collaboration that way too.

AI: That's a good point - the review process is definitely a form of collaboration. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are you seeing others around you using it similarly, or has the workplace environment shaped your approach in any particular way?

User: Work has influenced the way I use AI by making AI platforms more available. The use of AI in my workplace is not as widespread as it could be and others around me don't use it that often.

AI: Interesting - so your workplace has made the tools available, but adoption hasn't been as widespread among your colleagues. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I delegated the task of writing a motivational email to my team about a big event that they handled. I made minimal changes to the AI's email and sent it to the team. I received many comments about how touching the email was and how valued it made people feel. In another case, I wrote up a proposal that needed to have a specific number of words. My version was over the limit and I asked the AI to edit the document and ensure that it met the word count rule. It produced a well written document that was over the limit. This happened twice and it was very frustrating.

AI: Those are two very different experiences! The motivational email sounds like it really connected with your team in a meaningful way, while the proposal situation must have been quite frustrating to deal with twice.

When the AI struggled with the word count requirement, what do you think was going wrong there? Did you try adjusting your approach, or did you end up handling that task differently?

User: I adjusted the prompt and eventually it worked.

AI: Good that you were able to get it working eventually. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not sure I understand. But I am always trying to improve my prompts.

AI: Let me clarify - I was wondering whether you think about keeping your own writing skills sharp, given that you're delegating a lot of writing tasks to AI. For instance, do you ever worry about getting rusty at writing emails or proposals yourself, or is that not really a concern for you?

User: It's not a concern because I am still collaborating and honing my writing.

AI: That makes sense - you're still very much involved in the process through your collaboration and review.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently in the future?

User: Yes. If my work expands the use of AI to connect to other applications, I will use it much more. For example, it cannot review emails or documents in my folders. It would be great if I can get it to review and analyze emails or documents from email in a more simple way. Currently, I would have to find the documents and cut and paste.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how the practical limitations - like those proprietary systems and the cutting and pasting process - really shape how and when you choose to use AI.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I think it's important to discuss how over time, the AI models start to understand your writing style and when the AI writes on your behalf, it often replicates the human's style of writing so that people believe it was done by the human.

AI: That's a really fascinating observation - the AI learning to mirror your writing style over time so that its output feels authentically "you" to others. That definitely adds another layer to how people experience AI as a collaborative tool rather than just a separate entity doing work.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about everything from the practical challenges with different systems to how AI adapts to personal writing styles will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
