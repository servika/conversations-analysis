Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's start!

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I usually use it to get ideas for social media posts and edit/refine marketing copy

AI: That's helpful context. When you're using AI for those social media ideas and marketing copy edits, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like for you?

User: For marketing ideas, i usually ask for a list of topics or titles for a post, which sparks some ideas. Based on what I like from the list , or if the AI is going in a direction I don't like, I'll ask for another list. I often refine it a few times to get some solid ideas in my niche. Sometimes I ask for a summary of what the content should be, but I usually have my own ideas and find those suggestions unhelpful. For copy and emails, I'll share what I've composed and ask for editing help and suggestions.

AI: Tell me more about when you find the AI's content suggestions unhelpful. What specifically makes those fall short compared to your own ideas?

User: I don't create generic content and a big part of my brand is my unique voice, empathy, and insights. Often the AI suggestions are a little cliche or flat.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like maintaining that authentic voice is crucial for your brand. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I like to deal with the details of the content I'm creating. I like the suggestions AI gives to get the juices flowing. And I love the ability to edit and refine what I've created from a writing perspective (not content). It's like AI gets things going, I implement in my way, then take it back to AI to polish it up.

AI: That's a fascinating workflow - it sounds like you've found a real rhythm of back-and-forth collaboration. When you take your work back to AI for that final polish, what specific kinds of writing improvements do you find it excels at?

User: Conciseness and clarity! I am very wordy and my thoughts can get lost in the fluff, so AI helps me make my content more succinct and easy to read.

AI: That's such a practical partnership - using AI's strengths to complement your natural style. When you use AI for work in this collaborative way, how have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you approach it? Do you discuss AI usage with others in your field?

User: I'm self-employed, so I don't have a workplace/colleagues. It's not something I've discussed with others in my field yet.

AI: Ah, that makes sense - working solo gives you complete freedom to develop your own approach. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It would be one of the first times I used it. I was trying to write an email campaign and I was struggling to find the right words. I gave it the key points I was trying to make and it nailed it. It ended up being the easiest email I'd sent to date.

AI: That sounds like such a breakthrough moment - going from struggling to having it flow easily. Tell me more about what made that experience feel so successful compared to your usual process at the time.

User: Again, the conciseness and clarity. I was finding my email was getting too clunky and non-skimmable. Usually I would rewrite and refine for a while before feeling satisfied, but this time took a few minutes and I was happy with the results.

AI: That's a great example of how AI can streamline your process. Looking at how you work with AI now versus when you started, how do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I definitely don't want to over-rely on it! I still keep a fair balance of communicating my own thoughts, but the time spent writing is much less. I don't think it's negatively impacting my writing skills - I write prose here and there in my free time - but it helps elevate my level of concise communication (a skill I've never been super great at to begin with). I'm not concerned with it taking over in that area.

AI: It sounds like you've found a really healthy balance where AI actually helps you develop a skill you wanted to improve. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: As my business grows, I think I'll continue to rely on it for ideation for bigger projects (such as creating course outlines or digital products), but I don't think I'll be asking it to do much more than ideate and edit... But who knows!

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you develop conciseness - turning what could be seen as a weakness into a collaborative strength.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about finding that collaborative rhythm - using AI for ideation and polish while keeping the authentic voice and detailed content creation for yourself - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through your workflow and thoughts today!
