Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I don't use it every day in my work as a chaplain but I use it sometimes to help me brainstorm funeral services by helping me pick appropriate scriptures and helping me write a sermon. I sometimes use it as well to quickly find Bible references.

AI: That sounds like AI is helping you with some really meaningful work. When you're using it to brainstorm funeral services or find scriptures, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: I would first include non-personally identifiable details of the deceased such as if they liked gardening or cooking, etc to see if I can get my brain going on types of scriptures that might be a good fit. I then ask questions of the AI to refine my scripture search.

AI: That's really interesting how you use those personal details as a starting point. When you're going through that process of refining your scripture search with follow-up questions, what kinds of things do you find yourself asking the AI to help narrow it down?

User: Things like, what are other readings with similar themes. Or I may ask if there adjacent ideas that might serve as good readings

AI: I can see how that iterative process would help you explore different directions. I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI on these tasks. Are there certain parts of preparing a funeral service that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Yes, the sermon. I would get a basic draft but would highly edit or rewrite sections to ensure it is in my own voice

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping your own voice in something so personal. When you say you highly edit or rewrite sections, what is it about your voice that you're making sure comes through in the final sermon?

User: I may include further details about the person that I did not want to divulge to the AI. I would use these details to write personalized anecdotes or stories that would connect with mourners.

AI: That's a really thoughtful approach - keeping those more personal details between you and the families. When you use AI for work, like with the scripture searching or getting that initial sermon draft, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to go back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a task and then take what it gives you to work with on your own?

User: I have done both - I would say after a two or three iterations I would then take what I have and work with it on my own. I may take snippets of the various iterations I liked best as a starting point.

AI: That's a really practical approach - taking the best pieces from different rounds. How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you talked with other chaplains about this, or is it something you've figured out on your own?

User: I have figured this out on my own

AI: So you've been pioneering this yourself. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I used it to create a funeral program and it helped cut down the time significantly that I would ordinarily spend on research. That was satisfying

AI: That time savings sounds really valuable, especially when you're working with grieving families. How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I think the personal touch is so important and this is the skill I focus on maintaining. You asked before about tasks I won't hand over to AI. This definitely qualifies.

AI: That personal touch does seem central to chaplaincy work. Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I imagine AI would get better at approximating a person's writing or speaking voice. This may make it tempting to hand over more of the heavy lifting to AI.

AI: That's an interesting observation about AI getting better at mimicking voice. Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that personal touch and how you've developed this iterative approach on your own.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you balance AI assistance with maintaining that essential personal connection in chaplaincy work will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've thoughtfully navigated using AI as a research and brainstorming tool while preserving the deeply personal aspects that only you can provide to the families you serve.
