Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it for a variety of things but the generally breakdown into the following:

1. Summarizing documents
2. Helping me work on my writing
3. Summarizing a meeting
4. Giving me an idea of how to structure a talk or writing

AI: That's a helpful overview. Let me dig into one of those areas a bit more - when you mention helping with your writing, what does that interaction typically look like? Are you asking for feedback on drafts you've already written, or is it more collaborative from the start?

User: Getting feedback on something I've written. For example, I've used AI to help ensure all my writing is in the active voice

AI: That's interesting - you're using it as more of an editor for specific technical aspects like voice. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I prefer to draft most things myself as I have two options. First I write it myself and I get help from AI as an editor, or I use AI and then I have to fact check everything, make it sound like my writing, and then edit it still to fit what I need. I'd rather do the upfront work and generate new things rather than have to fix AI.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - it sounds like you've found it's actually more efficient to start with your own work than to clean up AI-generated content. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate

AI: Can you tell me more about what that collaboration looks like in practice? Walk me through a typical example of how you and AI work together on something.

User: I will find some interesting research or documents that I need to know about. So I will use AI to summarize documents.

Another way is to ask AI to give me some background information as a starting point. If the AI gives references I can then go check out those references and maybe get some extra information

AI: That's helpful - it sounds like you're using AI as a research assistant to get oriented and find entry points into topics. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: As I work in the environmental field I am a bit leery of AI since it has environmental impacts, this makes me caustious when using it and I try not to use it for everything. In addition, while I think AI is great as  a tool, I think the idea that it can replace creativity in humans, at least right now, is limited.

AI: That's a thoughtful perspective - balancing the utility of the tool with environmental considerations and maintaining your own creative contribution. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: AI gave false citations and false information. That is incredibly frustrating as I then have to spend time fixing it. But I have been satisfied using it as an editor or a starting point for some of my other work.

AI: That frustration with false citations really highlights why you prefer starting with your own work first. It sounds like there's a clear line for you between tasks where AI adds value versus where it creates more work.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't consider it much. If AI takes over some things, I'll adapt and find other things to use my time for.

AI: That's a pretty pragmatic approach. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I honestly don't know. I think at some point AI is going to have to scale back in a way. Its expensive and many of the softwares are currently free. That can't continue forever. I also think that AI will take over some tasks but I don't think it will replace most jobs.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on finding it more efficient to start with your own work rather than fixing AI-generated content, and your balanced view considering both the environmental impacts and practical utility.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I'm all good.

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as more of an editorial tool rather than a content generator, and your thoughtful approach to balancing utility with environmental considerations, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
