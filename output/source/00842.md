Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, let's go.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Well, I work as a software engineer and usually it helps me with many task throughout the lifecycle of the problems I solve. The most impactful task which AI helps a lot is in generating code. If I explain my requirement in a complete way and provide enough context, it saves a lot of time. Also I use AI a lot to phrase my ideas or what I want to send in a more formal way, primarily for communicating with stakeholders. And also any kind of brainstorming or ideation sessions ar greatly improved by conversations with LLMs.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like AI is touching multiple aspects of your work, from the technical coding side to communication and creative thinking.

When you mention providing "complete" requirements and "enough context" for code generation, what does that process actually look like for you? How do you go about setting up that interaction?

User: Requirements are usually coming from a Linear/JIRA ticket. However, I find that most of the times they are not complete as in ready-to-feed to an LLM. So i have to add my touches and think of it like I'm giving this task to a junior or someone with not much context to what has to be done. By context I mean giving all the related code or information about the codebase/database that is not visible or inferable from the code itself. Virtually anything that I think is relevant or I would need to know in order to successfully solve this as good as possible.

AI: That's a fascinating way to think about it - treating the AI like a junior developer who needs that full picture. 

Tell me more about that process of adding your "touches" to transform a ticket into something AI-ready. What are you typically filling in or clarifying that wasn't in the original requirements?

User: Well the original requirements usually depends on who wrote them. Some provide more details, some not. For example I specify if there are multiple services involved, if the focus of the work is for performance-first or for code readability-first, also giving it the context around why we want to do this and ask the AI if they think it's the most optimal idea.

AI: So you're actually having a strategic conversation with the AI about the approach itself, not just asking it to execute a predetermined solution. 

When you ask the AI whether they think something is the most optimal idea, how often does that lead to a back-and-forth? Do you find yourself adjusting your original thinking based on what the AI suggests?

User: Sometimes yes, but usually the initial approach is good enough, or the way the AI suggests to change this might be a little bit more optimal, but not worth the hassle of reviewing for example. Or if they propose a much complex approach without significant benefits, we drop that. It can lead to a back and forth, but we usually stop soon if we feel like the conversation is not going anywhere for now and tell the AI to stick to the original plan. It also helps us validate the proposed requirements even better, so win-win.

AI: That's a really practical approach - using AI as both a sounding board and a validator, but knowing when to cut off the discussion if it's not adding value.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yeah, there might be tasks which I prefer to do. Sometimes explaining to an AI everything it needs to know to solve something would take more time than actually doing it, so of course I do it. Or most of the times I attempt to do something especially if it's something I enjoy implementing, and then validate my solution against AI. So while there are definitely tasks I handle myself, most of the times I validate whatever I came with with an AI.

AI: So you're often using AI as a validation partner even when you do the initial work yourself - that's an interesting collaborative pattern.

When you mention tasks you "enjoy implementing," tell me more about that. What kinds of coding tasks do you find yourself wanting to tackle personally, even when AI could potentially handle them?

User: Working with database queries for example, I like to think of them from scratch. And if I feel it takes too much time to get what I need, AI is helpful. Reviewing PRs is another kind of thing I do and rarely ask for AI.

AI: Interesting - so you enjoy the puzzle-solving aspect of database queries and prefer to maintain that human judgment in code reviews.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: For simple tasks I try to delegate it as much as possible. But most of the time it's about collaboration, understanding their changes, asking for adjustments if something is off, then again until it's a good version.

AI: That iterative collaboration sounds like it's become a pretty natural workflow for you.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find that your team has developed any shared practices or approaches?

User: Yep, most of my teammates are using that and we are encouraged to do so, as it boost productivity significantly. We share tips and tricks to each other when we have the chance, and we are up-to-date with the newest technologies in the industry that can help us make everything faster.

AI: That sounds like a really supportive environment for AI adoption. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well there are times when no matter how much context or how hard you try to explain something, the AI will not get it. This is sometimes frustrating. But sometimes just starting from scratch a new conversation and trying all over again helps a lot.

AI: That's really relatable - the frustration when you feel like you're explaining clearly but the AI isn't getting it.

Tell me more about what you think causes those moments when the AI just doesn't seem to understand, even with good context. Have you noticed any patterns in when that happens?

User: Maybe explanation is not so good, and usually the conversation is already long enough.

AI: That makes sense - the conversation length seems to be a key factor you've noticed.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I'm realising that while this is a good productivity booster, it might decrease the "brain" productivity. So I'm currently searching of ways to maintain this pace but to also spend some dedicated time without AIs,  just me and a piece of paper or something like that. Do you have any suggestions on that tho?

AI: That's a thoughtful concern about maintaining your own problem-solving abilities. While I can't offer specific advice during this interview, it sounds like you're already thinking about the right balance.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Where do you see this going for you personally?

User: Well, evolving fast, just like all the LLMs are doing. The agents will be more sophisticated and capable, so at some point we will have to come with something very human-specific in order to not lose our jobs.

AI: That's a really candid perspective on the future - both the opportunities and the challenges.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you described treating AI like a junior developer who needs full context, and your awareness of balancing productivity gains with maintaining your own cognitive abilities.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope, I think I shared most of my experiences. Thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the collaborative aspects of working with AI, the importance of context-setting, and your thoughtful approach to skill maintenance will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
