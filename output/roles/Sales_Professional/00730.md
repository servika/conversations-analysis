Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's do it!

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI a lot for rewording emails for clarity, checking myself and my logic in areas where my coworkers don't have the expertise to check me, data analysis, preliminary research, unlisted research, ideating, writing nested Excel formulas, creating document templates, and writing repetitive documents.

AI: That's quite a range of uses! It sounds like AI has become integrated into many different aspects of your work. 

Tell me more about what you mean by "unlisted research" - I'm curious what that involves for you.

User: So, I had this one project where I needed to research and reccomend chairs to purchase that could better accommodate bodies of all sizes. The current limiting factor is the distance between the arms. I wanted to find chairs with no arms. However, the most budget freindly chairs only had a 330lb weight limit. I needed to find out existing chairs to know their offical weight limit to know if I was justified in buying chairs with such a low limit. However, most sales listings and descriptions for the existing chairs are no longer posted, as they've been retried and an updated version replaced them. AI was able to scrape old search engine tags, as I understand it, to confirm that our existing chairs' official limit was only 300lbs, making my reccomended chairs an upgrade in weight limit too. The AI also found a couple sources that were still listed, but it set my mind at ease to see so many sources corroborating it even though I couldn't actually view the pages.

AI: That's a fascinating example of AI helping you track down information that would have been nearly impossible to find through conventional searches. It sounds like AI was able to access or recall information from sources that are no longer publicly available.

When you're using AI to check your logic in areas where your coworkers lack expertise, how does that process typically work? What does that interaction look like?

User: It happens a lot with ADA accommodations and other legal compliance. I think through everything I know, maybe run a few searches. And then I hop over to my AI of choice, share the issue and my analysis, run through my logic and sources, and then ask what I'm missing and if there are better recommendations.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI as a kind of expert consultant to validate your thinking in specialized areas. 

When you go through that process of sharing your analysis and asking what you're missing, do you find yourself working back and forth with the AI - like having a dialogue where you refine ideas together - or do you typically present everything at once and get a comprehensive response that you then act on?

User: I try to present everything up front, but the conversation always evolves into a dialogue, as I discover I need to clarify details of what I've shared and as I try to bettwe understand what the AI has shared. We always end up working together and I usually celebrate with the AI when I feel good about our conclusion

AI: That's wonderful that you celebrate with the AI when you reach a good conclusion together! It sounds like these interactions naturally evolve from your initial comprehensive input into something more collaborative.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I have some tasks that IT at my job requires that I do myself because they don't trust the AI platforms to keep data confidential and secure. Data analysis involving identifyable employee information, wage info, etc. I'd prefer to collaborate with AI, but i'm not allowed. I also prefer to write my own emails and use AI to edit them, rather than using it to write from scratch. Maybe it's just because I've used AI so much, but I can tell when it's an AI's writing, not mine, and I feel others could tell too.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - both the security restrictions from IT and your preference to maintain your authentic voice in communications. It's interesting that you can recognize AI-generated writing even in your own work.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? It sounds like IT has clear boundaries, but what about the broader workplace environment?

User: I've really been an AI pioneer in my workplace. I've had coworkers adamantly against it and coworkers who are eager to learn more about it. None of it impacts the way I personally use AI.

AI: That's really striking that you've maintained your own approach despite such varied reactions from colleagues. It sounds like you've charted your own course as an early adopter.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I created a corrective action counseling report drafting custom GPT. It took a few weeks of fiddling, as it was my first custom GPT and I had zero guidance outside of the internet and chatbots. Getting it to write my first real corrective action counseling report was a huge win, and I got my boss using it, who raved about it!

AI: That sounds like a major accomplishment - creating your first custom GPT from scratch and having it work so well that your boss adopted it too! The fact that it took weeks of fiddling shows real persistence on your part.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not bothered by it. I know that there are core aspects of my job that AI could never replace and I'm willing to upskill to keep up with the times. The way I see it, AI is here to stay and I can either be fearful and fall behind, becoming an AI casualty, or I can make myself valuable in an AI world and ride the wave.

AI: That's such a pragmatic and forward-thinking perspective - viewing AI as a wave to ride rather than resist. It sounds like you've really embraced the technology as a tool for enhancing rather than replacing your core capabilities.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I'll continue to use it and I plan to keep up with developments to take advantage of new abilities as they're released. As it gets better, I'll get better.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being an AI pioneer in your workplace and how you've maintained your own approach regardless of colleagues' varied reactions.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?
