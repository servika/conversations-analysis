Assistant: Hi, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds great. I think I'm ready.

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I am a writer. I write fiction novels and short stories. I have been concentrating on one series, but I am thinking of branching out into other series and genres. Although some life circumstances have kept me from a healthy writing routine lately, usually what I do when I'm starting a project is brainstorm a situation, setting, and characters. If I am continuing a series (rather than starting a new one) I consider what has been happening up to this point, as well as where I want it to go. I don't tend to write a full point-by-point plotline, but rather rough out where I want to start. Then I write. I don't usually backtrack, but push through to the end of the first draft because if I stop and go back, it's harder to finish. If I think I'm missing something along the way, I make notes. After the first draft, I reread it and make more notes, then try to incorporate any changes / additions. I reread and edit at least one more time, but it could be more if I realize I've made a major error. Does that make sense?

AI: That makes perfect sense - thank you for walking me through your process. It sounds like you have a really thoughtful approach, especially pushing through that first draft without looking back. I can see how stopping to revise mid-way could break the momentum.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: I would definitely use AI to help with the brainstorming. First of all, in a series it's very, very easy to lose track of characters, especially characters who are secondary in one book but might become primary in another. This is especially true in what I write, because I tend to write about small towns or other communities, so there are a lot of secondary characters. I want to develop a story bible that includes the characters and actions that have happened in previous books so I don't lose track. Books have character arcs, but so do series. I want the AI to help me plan out the series arc and then help me determine how to move forward. I tend to get stuck inside my own head and have a hard time wading through. I'd also like help developing the characters and maybe spin-off series, so I want the AI to help write sketches for that.  It's also very helpful for the AI to assist in editing, and also in the administrative/marketing tasks. I am an independent author, so I need to do all of the publishing tasks as well as the creation tasks. It is great that AI can help with that.

AI: Tell me more about getting stuck inside your own head - what does that feel like when you're trying to work through story problems on your own?

User: Sometimes I look at what's been done or the characters that are already created and I just can't see a way forward. I have a general ideal of where I want to end up, but I don't know how to start. That's when I tend to get caught in an endless loop of rewriting. I don't know how to get where I want to go, so I polish and polish and polish the text that's already written. I think AI can help break me out of that cycle.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - being caught in that polishing loop when what you need is forward momentum. 

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: As I said, I haven't been working productively on my writing lately, but I want that to change. Mostly I've been using AI for brainstorming situations and characters just generally rather than sticking to a particular project or series. It's helping to open me up and see the possibilities again. It makes me feel hopeful that I'll be able to take back my creativity again. It's nice to have a creative partner who works with me and helps me see the options.

AI: That sense of having a creative partner sounds really meaningful, especially when you're trying to reconnect with your creativity. 

When you're working with AI in those brainstorming sessions, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I feel that I'm driving the collaboration. The AI prompts me with questions or suggestions, but it is my decision whether to take them or whether to add more details or go in a different direction. AI is strong support and extremely helpful, but writing is a part of me and I want the work to be mine. Like I said, the AI helps open me up.  When I start to use the AI for help editing, again, the decision of whether or not to accept the edits will be mine because I know the story I want to tell. But it's so helpful to have another set of "eyes" on the piece to point out issues I might have missed.

AI: It sounds like you've found a really balanced dynamic - the AI as support that helps unlock possibilities while you maintain ownership of the creative vision.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: At the moment, I think it's just breaking through the blocks. Breaking through the rust and being able to see the possibilities and the different options. Helping find ways to break open creative thinking. That is helping me move forward and things are starting to flow again. Is that what you meant?

AI: Yes, absolutely - that's exactly what I meant. It sounds like AI is helping you break through those creative barriers and get the flow back, which is huge.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: My concerns aren't necessarily about AI itself, but about how people are using it. There are so many people who are not using AI as a tool, but are using it as a fast way to upload books and other content and make money. That floods the market with pieces and also gives everyone the wrong impression about how to use AI, or how dangerous it is. This is already happening - especially in Kindle Unlimited. That will impact the ability of people like me to publish independently and the platforms that are willing to take my work. Which will only add the publishing gatekeepers back in the mix. And also, I don't necessarily want books written that are solely generated by AI, especially fiction, because I think those come from the depth of the human experience. I love AI, but the humanity is important too. I also think that people misusing the tool of AI scare off others who *could* find a lot of benefit from it.

AI: That's a really nuanced perspective - distinguishing between AI as a creative tool versus using it to flood the market. It sounds like you're seeing firsthand how misuse could actually harm the very platforms and opportunities that independent authors like yourself depend on.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: As I move forward, I expect to use AI more intensely beyond the brainstorming function. I want to use it as a true creative partner, not only with brainstorming, but with helping to develop characters and situations and structure a longer work or series. I will be using it to help me edit and to review works for plot holes and other confusing areas. For the administrative/publishing tasks, I will be using it to help me write blog posts for my website, to write emails, and (hopefully) to write presentations. I expect that I will use it to help with research, especially market research. As AI images improve, I will be using them to help come up with cover designs. Whether I can use them to complete the cover will depend on how the sites like Amazon respond to the AI influx. But mostly, I want to use AI to help me really step into my creativity as a writer.

AI: It sounds like you have a really comprehensive vision for how AI can support your writing career at every level - from the creative heart of it to the business side. I particularly appreciated your perspective on the difference between using AI as a creative partner versus misusing it to flood the market, and how that misuse could actually harm the platforms independent authors rely on.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Well, one thing I was thinking is that I wish there was a way I could load a longer document - like a story bible or character bible or even a whole book - and have it available without having to load it each time. I know the AI assistants don't necessarily retain memory from conversation to conversation, but it would be helpful if I didn't have to load it ever time I started a new chat. And I would want that to be personal to me (or at least have the option to be personal) so that everyone in the world couldn't look at it. Just because there's a lot of theft in the author space as bad actors pick up text and republish it under their own name.

AI: That's a really valuable insight - the need for persistent, private storage of your creative materials that you can reference across sessions. That would eliminate a lot of friction and protect your intellectual property at the same time. I can see how having to reload your story bible or character documents every time would be a significant barrier to using AI as that deeper creative partner you described.

Thank you so much for sharing such thoughtful perspectives today. Your insights about using AI as a creative tool while maintaining your voice and vision, the challenges with market flooding, and the practical needs like secure document storage will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate the time you took to walk me through your experiences so openly.

User: Thank you! It was fun!

AI: You're so welcome! I'm glad you enjoyed it - your enthusiasm for the creative possibilities really came through. Best of luck getting back into that healthy writing routine and building out your series. It sounds like you have some exciting projects ahead!
