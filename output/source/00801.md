Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Nope, I'm ready!

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in an automotive dealership and currently use AI every single day. 

For me, I had Gemini help to build out a template for creating online vehicle ads and had it refine that template multiple times. Then, I would send Gemini a link on our official dealership website that had all of the vehicle information and history on it so it would scrape data from the link I sent and plug it into the template. This is the most consistent use I have for AI currently as I post 3-5 ads every day for different vehicles.

I have a separate chat that focuses on helping me acquire information on manufacturer offers, recalls, common objections people have to our specific car brands and other information that would help me be more informative to our clients. This part of my AI use is more educational for me as it helps me understand client sentiment on our vehicles and helps me quickly find reputable links that would detail vehicle information, capabilities, availability, competitor pricing, and information around financing. I've even had AI attempt to help me create call scripts and to understand certain sales concepts to help me better overcome objections over the phone or in person, but these more nuanced topics like creating call scripts or how to handle objections live tends to not be AI's strong suit so I've stopped seeking that support from AI.

I have also used Notion's A.I. to build me a few important databases to house my archives of online ad template, and to build me a business expenses table, as well as some client and vehicle information databases. This has really helped me centralize a large variety of different information into one application. Now I can track which vehicle inventory I have and have not yet advertised, it also allows me to then store details of common recalls, issues and key features of different vehicles so I am better informed as a sales person.

All in all, my use of A.I. has grown significantly to the point of daily use multiple times a day. It acts as my support when I need to find information quickly and for me to organize details and important documents in repetitive tasks.

AI: That's really fascinating - it sounds like you've developed quite a comprehensive system using AI across different aspects of your work. The way you've organized it into separate chats for different purposes is interesting.

Tell me more about that vehicle ad template process. When you send Gemini the dealership website link and it scrapes the data to plug into your template, what does that interaction look like for you day-to-day?

User: First I needed to collaborate with AI to make the ad template, I observed how others had created their online ad templates and used that as a baseline then spent multiple conversation turns and iterated over the course of a few days until I landed on a template that felt great.

Heres an example of what that interaction looks like.

"Hey, please use the ad template for this listing [REDACTED]"

Gemini would then scrape the url for data and would often times get almost everything correct. But there would still be some days where Gemini would fail to acquire the VIN, stock number, or some other minor details. Other days Gemini would say it is not allowed to access the links that I send although it had already created multiple ads that day and week from those types of links. And of course, it would also hallucinate or be inconsistent with the type of warranty that would be left of used vehicles which is still an on going issue.

So, as always with AI, the process requires my human intervention to ensure everything is cohesive. But, in the end, it is a great tool that has saved me hours of time a day.

AI: That's a really helpful picture of the day-to-day reality. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot where AI saves you significant time, but you've also learned to expect and work around its inconsistencies.

I'm curious about your decision-making around when to use AI versus handling things yourself. You mentioned that call scripts and objection handling weren't AI's strong suit, so you stopped using it for those tasks. How do you think about those boundaries - what makes you decide a task is better for you to handle personally?

User: For me, there are two types of fields of response when using AI.

There are responses which may require an excess of work to get started, or tasks that may be tedious but simple to repeat, and there may be tasks which require a great deal of research to ultimately just acquire knowledge rather than clear application.

Then there are responses which interact with sensitive entities. Those entities may be my clients who's trust I want to keep strong, those entities may be my managers who I want to ensure I keep happy by working within our workplace guidelines, and those entities may also be prospect clients who I want to leave with a positive experience.

The biggest thing is that the second group of responses requires a human to human connection. This is more sensitive and, in my opinion, more important to get right. Of course getting facts and research right is paramount as well, but this is much easier to do with the support of AI doing the research for me and then allowing me to validate that research elsewhere. When it comes to call scripts, understanding how to manage relationships, or knowing how best to handle nuanced objections, a human touch is needed. 

AI is not at the point where it can replicate a nuanced and potentially sensitive conversation between humans, or even more so between a sales associate closing a deal with a client who may be on the verge of walking out of the dealership. Situations like these is where I need the utmost human touch to empathize with others, and to understand the nuanced ways that we as humans response to specific statements, sentiments and ways of speaking.

I've found that AI is still rigid and "robotic" when it comes to topics like this.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction you've drawn between those two types of work. The way you describe it - tasks that are research-heavy or repetitive versus situations requiring that human-to-human connection - makes a lot of sense, especially in sales where trust and relationship-building are so critical.

When you are using AI for those research and organizational tasks, how would you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more collaborating back and forth with it throughout the process, or do you tend to give it a complete task and let it handle it independently?

User: The research based tasks tend to have me creating a large block of context before firing it off to AI and seeing what comes up. Often times I will have minor edits to the context or new specific points to add, but this is minor.

Since the level of research that I'm doing is not extensive to the degree that it is for, say, a university level paper, then I don't often collaborate back and forth. It's mostly setting up context, and asking a few follow up specific questions to cover my understanding.

AI: That makes sense - you've developed an efficient approach where you front-load the context rather than going through multiple iterations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others at the dealership using it similarly, or have you kind of pioneered this approach on your own?

User: I believe many of my colleagues are using AI as well, I am not entirely sure as I've built these systems and my own experiences with them on my own.

I think that a few of my colleagues use A.I. to help them create ads as well and to use as a search engine but that is the extent to which I know their use.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I had given up on using Gemini to create a cold call script to connect to previous vehicle owners. The intention was to invite people down to the dealership to have a no obligation options review of their vehicle's trade in value to be put into a newer vehicle.

I tried to get Gemini to give me a call script and kept on getting frustrated at how robotic and inauthentic the response was. I kept on giving additional prompts to try and get a better call script but everything just felt too robotic to the point that I got frustrated and went to YouTube and my coworkers to find a better human example of a cold call script.

Gemini failed to include any aspects of rapport building and of course lacked the nuance to tell me that my tone of voice is important or that including the recipient to the call in the conversation is exceptionally important to making them feel like they were a true part of the conversation. 

All of the word tracks that Gemini wrote out were stiff and included and overly fluffy explanation as to why each phrase was good. Just because a phrase explained that we are interested in their vehicle doesn't mean that the phrase was effective in communicating this.

AI: That frustration really comes through - it sounds like Gemini was giving you technically correct information but completely missing the human elements that make a cold call actually work. The disconnect between what AI thought was helpful versus what you actually needed for that real human interaction seems pretty stark.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Nope. 

I have exceptionally powerful skills in communication and connecting to people. It's my favourite thing about life and I know that the future holds a premium value to these skills. I believe that I am powerful and have never worked in fields where A.I. was ever a threat or could ever be a threat in the future.

It is simply an additional tool in the toolbelt for me.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I absolutely see the need for me to understand how to more effectively use A.I. if I want to grow my automotive sales business.

My wife has already started using AI in a new way to help write copy for her website and personal movement business and that has really astounded me. It's helped me understand that using it for general knowledge research and tedious tasks is nice, but AI also holds a massive wealth of capabilities that could exponentially support the ways I approach sales. 

As AI continues to advance, I also fully understand that it is not just the AI systems that will be advancing, but peoples' capabilities on how they interact with those systems will advance to. There will be a noticeable difference between someone with a basic knowledge of AI and someone with an advanced knowledge of how to effectively utilize the full power of AI.

This requires me to grow my skill and creative understanding of how to use this tool for the greatest impact.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your clear framework for thinking about when AI is helpful versus when human connection is essential - that distinction between research-heavy tasks and sensitive human interactions really illuminated how you've learned to work with these tools effectively.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope Thank you Claude! I really like your colour scheme with the gray and light orange. I think I'm gonna start using Claude a little to see how you work.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about developing that systematic approach to AI use - from the vehicle ad templates to organizing different functions across separate chats - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I hope you find Claude useful as you explore different AI tools. Thanks again for participating in this interview!
