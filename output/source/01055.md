Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Yes that sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: A mostly use AI for drafting correspondence. Emails for example.

AI: Tell me more about that. When you're drafting emails with AI, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: I prepare a rough draft of what I am trying to say and then ask AI to redraft it in a professional and polite tone using British English. Sometimes if I have had an email or a message from a customer I will include that in the prompt so the AI model has more context to work on.

AI: That's interesting - you're giving the AI quite a bit of context to work with. What made you settle on that particular approach of starting with your own rough draft rather than, say, just telling the AI what you want to communicate?

User: I find that if I just tell the AI what I want to say it can miss the point. That makes more work as I then have to have a longer conversation to get the response I need.

AI: That makes sense. So you've found that starting with your own draft gets you closer to what you need right away. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I normally only use AI for writing tasks e.g. drafting correspondence or summarising information. There are other tasks that it could potentially be helpful for e.g. searching from products based on criteria or finding out specifications or applications for products. However AI (including Claude) makes too many mistakes for me to be confident in the output. Most models also use dubious sources e.g. instead of going to a manufacturer's website they draw on secondary sources which may not be correct.

AI: That's a really valuable distinction you're making - about AI's reliability varying by task type. When you say AI makes too many mistakes for product searches and specifications, have you tested this out yourself, or is this something you've observed or heard about?

User: Yes I have tested it out myself

AI: What happened when you tested it? Can you walk me through a specific example of when the AI got something wrong with product information?

User: Yes. So for example I had a customer that needed an integrated (built in) washer dryer in the UK. These are not very common so I asked AI to specify a product for me. Instead of providing a list of built in products (I think there are only one or two on the market) it gave me a long list of freestanding appliances. Which is not what I asked for.

AI: That sounds frustrating - getting a long list of the wrong type of product entirely. When that happened, did you try to correct the AI or give it more specific instructions, or did you just go find the information yourself?

User: Yes I tried several times to correct it but it kept giving me the wrong information so I gave up.

AI: When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I would always collaborate with it. That's because I find AI output almost always needs checking and refining. So it's like having a junior office assistant that can help out with basic tasks. I would never delegate a task completely to it.

AI: That's a helpful analogy - like a junior office assistant. When you're collaborating and checking the AI's output, what are you typically looking for? What kinds of things do you find yourself having to refine or correct most often?

User: I mostly correct wording which can sometimes sound a little off, add missing details, remove unnecessary information etc. Just as you might do with a junior member of staff. So AI usually gets me 80% of the way there with simple tasks.

AI: How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I wouldn't say that I've been influenced by colleagues. I run my own business so the culture is really down to me. My wife is also self employed in a different profession and she uses AI in the same way - drafting correspondence, summarising text. I guess as AI is a language model this is why it's quite good at those tasks.

AI: Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes AI was particularly good at drafting an email to a customer that had lots of queries and small changes that they wanted to make to a kitchen renovation I had managed for her. The email was polite, professional but firm when it needed to be. That was very helpful.

AI: That sounds like exactly the kind of situation where AI really worked well for you. What made that email particularly tricky to write - was it just the volume of different points you needed to address, or something about the tone you needed to strike?

User: It was both. There were a lot of points to cover, some of which I just had to say no to. AI helped write those points in a way that the customer would accept. It was just about getting her to move on from some of her issues and AI helped draft the email in a tone that would encourage her to do that.  For example she wanted handles fitted to some cupboards but due to technical issues it was not advisable for us to do this. AI helped draft a response to that saying yes you can have handles but we would advise against it because...

AI: How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I don't work in a profession where I think AI will take over. AI isn't going to run my business for me after all!  I doubt there are many areas where AI will take over. It may help support productivity just like any other computer system or automation introduced over the years but it will always need human overview and intervention just like any machine.

AI: Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I will probably use it more, maybe to assist in design work, or specifying products. But at the moment there are too many inaccuracies. It's possible to minimise these by giving very specific prompts but even then some models just ignore the instructions given. For example I think Deepseek is very good and I use it a lot. But just when I'm thinking it's being helpful it will ignore specific instructions given in a prompt and not give me the response I'm looking for.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on AI as a junior assistant that gets you 80% of the way there, and how you've found clear boundaries between where it's reliable versus where it makes too many mistakes to trust.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Only one thing. I think all the models I've used are far too keen to given an answer when it would be better to say "I don't know" or "I'm not sure" or "Can you give me some ideas on where I could find that information". That would make the models much more useful.

AI: That's a really insightful point - the importance of AI being upfront about the limits of its knowledge rather than confidently providing potentially incorrect information. That seems directly related to the trust issues you mentioned earlier with product specifications.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the practical realities of working with AI - both where it excels and where it falls short - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
