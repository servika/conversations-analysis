Assistant: Hi, I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I mainly use it for brainstorming activity ideas for certain age groups and developmental levels for children, aged 0-12. I can use it to tailor activities for a variety of children in a group so all the activities are accessible to all children and they are still learning from it.

AI: That sounds like really thoughtful work - making sure activities work for all the children in your group. 

Tell me more about how you go about tailoring those activities. What does that process look like when you're working with AI to adapt something for different developmental levels?

User: For example, I currently look after an 18 month old and a 4 year old. Obviously, the age gap means they are worlds apart in developmental levels as well. In this instance, I would ask the AI to brainstorm activities with me that would suit their differing ages and physical capabilities. Activities they can participate in together. If the answers are too generic from the AI, I would give it more details, like the 4 year old is struggling to share with the 18 month old, or the 18 month old is a capable walker but is still getting used to running. Then the activities would be more suited to them.

AI: That's a really specific example - I can see how much you're thinking about each child's individual needs. 

When you mention giving the AI more details to get less generic answers, what does that back-and-forth conversation typically look like? How many rounds of refinement do you usually go through before you get something that feels right for your situation?

User: It differs really on what the activities I'm looking for are. Sometimes the AI is really smart and can give me really helpful suggestions straight away but other times it takes quite a few rounds, maybe 5 or more. 

Mostly the physical activities (e.g. obstacle courses, races, etc.) are the easiest to brainstorm for the AI. What they seem to struggle with is the problem-solving activities for children (e.g. puzzles, memory games, etc.). These are hard for the AI to brainstorm to suit groups of children with differing capabilities.

AI: That's a really interesting distinction - physical activities versus problem-solving ones. 

Can you walk me through what happens when you're trying to get help with those trickier problem-solving activities? What makes them so much harder for the AI to get right?

User: I think the nature of the problem-solving tasks is the issue. With physical activities, its much easier for children to go at their own pace. Think of an obstacle course - children can just do what they feel comfortable doing and then run around obstacles they're not ready to challenge. 

Problem-solving activities, on the other hand, generally have a right or wrong answer, and this means it is automatically easier for older children to do than younger ones, because their brain hasn't developed enough to think of other options to get this right answer. The AI, therefore, struggles to come up with activities that are challenge enough for older children, but also doable for younger children. The balance is harder to find than with physical activities.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - you're describing a fundamental cognitive difference where the problem-solving tasks have that inherent right-wrong structure that doesn't naturally accommodate different developmental stages.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: There are certain tasks I do myself that AI would have no trouble doing. Writing observations and entries for children's experiences is a big one. If I put in a few keywords or gave the AI a few descriptive sentences about an experience with a child, it would most certainly be able to do a quick write-up of the activity. But I think this is something all adults who look after children should be doing themselves. Having AI write observations on children takes away a personal touch that is very important.

AI: That's really thoughtful - you're drawing a clear line around what feels too personal to delegate. 

Can you tell me more about what you mean by that "personal touch"? What would be lost if AI wrote those observations instead of you?

User: It's hard to put into words. I suppose it's the connection that the adult has with the child. The write-up reinforces this bond and helps to develop the adult's skills in helping children grow and learn. The adult could also get ideas for the next activity for the child while they're doing the write-up. For example, the adult is writing about how [REDACTED] did really well on the balance beam and then they think 'to develop these balancing skills further, we could do this or that next week, and that would also help [REDACTED] with his physical development.'

I think parents appreciate reading observations on their children that they know came from a person that helps their child/ren too. There's always a hint of enthusiasm and pride in it.

AI: That connection you're describing - where writing the observation sparks ideas for future activities - sounds like a really important part of your professional development too.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I collaborate with it. As I said before, sometimes the AI can brainstorm quite well on the first try - which obviously doesn't take any collaboration. But I generally give it nudges in certain directions throughout a conversation to tailor the suggestions.

AI: I can see how that collaborative approach works well for your brainstorming sessions.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Do you find yourself discussing AI use with other childcare providers, or is it something you've mostly figured out on your own?

User: We do talk about it somewhat in the workplace and everyone seems to have various opinions on it. Some educators and nannies are happy to use AI for their observational write-ups while others think that's not appropriate. We're mostly independent businesses so each person has their own way of using AI.

AI: That's interesting that there's such a range of approaches, even within the same field.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was really struggling to come up with an innovative idea for the children for Easter. Everything seemed to have been done before and I wanted something new, or even something that wasn't completely new but had an innovative aspect to it. I was struggling to come up with ideas so went to AI to brainstorm. But it was just an exercise in futility. I tried to use keywords and explain what I was after but the AI just kept spitting out generic ideas. I persevered for ages, trying different wording but it just became too frustrating and I gave up.

AI: That sounds really frustrating - especially when you had a clear vision of wanting something innovative but couldn't get the AI to understand that nuance.

What did you end up doing for the Easter activity? Did you eventually find that innovative idea you were looking for, or did you have to settle for something more traditional?

User: I asked around on some child care forums and lots of people had ideas that they had done with some success. I decided to put a bunch of their ideas together and came up with a mish mash of activities for the week - some old, some new, some all over the place, but the children liked it.

AI: That's a great example of finding a different path when one tool didn't work out. It sounds like the human network gave you what AI couldn't - that mix of tested ideas you could combine creatively.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: My job is a very practical one so I don't think it or my skills are in danger of being taken over by AI. There are definitely parts of my job I would like to see have less AI influence, such as the observational write-ups I mentioned, but otherwise, I don't think parents will be encouraging AI to look after their children over an actual person anytime soon.

AI: That's a practical perspective - recognizing the inherently human aspects of your work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you think you'll use it differently as the technology develops, or will you likely stick with the brainstorming approach that's working for you now?

User: Personally, I will likely stick to the brainstorming approach and that's about it. It would be helpful to have AI do some more mundane tasks, like noting what the children had for lunch in their planners, which is time-consuming and not particularly personal. But honestly I don't know how that would work.

Overall, I'm happy to keep using AI for brainstorming and that's it.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that personal connection in observations and how you've found AI works well for physical activities but struggles with problem-solving tasks for mixed-age groups.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, all is good

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts. The way you've thought through which tasks benefit from AI collaboration versus those that require that human touch is exactly the kind of nuanced perspective we're looking to understand better.

Have a great rest of your day!
