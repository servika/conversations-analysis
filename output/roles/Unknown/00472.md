Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: All sounds good to me.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Sure! I have found AI to be useful in lots of ways as a mental health therapist, such as (1) I use it when I need a quick refresher on clinical criteria for a diagnosis - for example, if I'm trying to determine between an "adjustment disorder with anxiety" or "adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression" (2) I use it when I'm trying to write up treatment plans to help me brainstorm - for example "what are objectives over a 6 month period when using CBT to address anxiety" (3) I use it when I'm looking up resources for a client, for ex. I need 3 free mindfulness apps that contain guided imagery scripts or sleep stories (4) I can also use it when needing a quick refresher on medications (ex. what medication is most common to cause or correlate with Serotonin Syndrome) and (5) It's helpful when I'm drawing up exposure hierarchies to work on such as: I need a 3 month exposure hierarchy to address ranitadophobia with weekly exposures, twice a week, growing in intensity but starting small.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses across different aspects of your clinical work. It sounds like AI has become quite integrated into various parts of your practice.

I'm particularly curious about those exposure hierarchies you mentioned - when you're working on something like that ranitadophobia example, how do you typically interact with the AI? Are you going back and forth with it to refine the hierarchy, or do you usually get what you need in one exchange?

User: I've used it in both ways. Sometimes I do it in more of a delegate way where I take it to AI and ask for a response to be drawn up, and then I take it and personally edit it much more based on what I already know about the client (ex. if they gave a recommendation to go to the zoo twice a week for exposures, I would nix that knowing they are a working adult without the time to go to the zoo twice a week and would substitute it with something more realistic to their lifestyle/schedule). There are other times where I go back and forth with the AI and collaborate more, fine-tuning it together, but most of the times I tend to just need a starting point from it.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed a clear sense of when you need that collaborative back-and-forth versus when you just need a solid starting point to work from.

You mentioned editing based on what you already know about the client, like their schedule and lifestyle. Are there certain aspects of your therapeutic work where you prefer to handle things yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them?

User: Yes, there are aspects such as the fine-tuning of exposure hierarchies that I think for the most part benefit from my own personalization (what I know about the client, what I can edit and revise). There are times also when I use the AI to help me proof and polish up an email - especially if its a hefty email with a lot in it - but the majority of the time I like to freehand the emails so that I make sure I still come across as me, personable, a human being. I didn't want to always sound perfect - especially with clients who I've done a lot of work with to reduce their perfectionistic tendencies.

AI: That's fascinating - you're thinking about how your own authenticity and imperfection actually serves the therapeutic relationship, especially with perfectionist clients. That's such a thoughtful consideration.

When you do use AI for those heftier emails that you mentioned, could you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Are you drafting something first and then asking AI to polish it, or starting from scratch with AI and then making it more "you"?

User: Sure, I tend to draft it myself first long hand and then run it through AI and ask for a more concise version of it. I know that I can be wordy myself and while I don't mind that in shorter emails, that's too much if it's in an email that's covering multiple items such as "Let's create a cheat sheet for you based on what's been helpful and not helpful with anxiety reduction techniques" and then make a bullet point list of what's helped, bullet point list of what's not helped, an extra notes section of still items or techniques or therapies to continue exploring, etc. I'll make sure to not put any identifying information in it (client name, PII, etc.) and ask for help with firming it up.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - getting help with structure and conciseness while protecting client privacy. You clearly have a systematic approach to maintaining confidentiality while still getting the benefits of AI assistance.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Has that been a factor in how you've developed these practices?

User: I work in private practice (solo) and WFH and therefore don't have any regular social interaction with colleagues - but I do try to meet with a few on a monthly basis for talking shop or staffing cases together. To be honest, I can't think of any of them who really use AI the way that I've been experimenting with so I don't have too much influence from there. I have noticed the telehealth platform I use for video/audio sessions is now offering a new feature where you can pay a monthly charge for an AI to "listen" to sessions and create a transcript for you of the note so you don't have to write it yourself. I haven't tried it yet but think it's a cool option, I just need to research further what the maintenance of HIPAA is in a situation like that, if I need to have clients sign off on disclaimers with it for informed consent.

AI: It sounds like you're pretty much pioneering your own path with AI since your colleagues aren't exploring it the same way. That telehealth platform feature is really interesting - and I can see why you'd want to carefully research the HIPAA implications before diving in.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes! I've created a lot of fear exposure hierarchies (ERP) in my OCD work over the years and I went through a period of time where I feel like I'm not being as fresh as I can be with creation of them (how could this be more creative? am I challenging the client hard enough? what contamination fear exposures am I not thinking of yet? what exposures are other therapists recommending? Do they go through the same pacing as I do? ) Since each person has their own individual experience with OCD, I haven't yet found any workbooks or websites that really do an exhaustive list of say, "Hey if you've been working with a client with contamination fears, here's 50+ different exposures you could try" - not necessarily to copy verbatim but at least to get brainstorming. I do remember just randomly running it through an AI one day about a fear exposure hierarchy creation for fear of frogs and it just spit out all these great ideas that I had not thought of yet and it felt really wonderful to have some of that mental labor relieved.

AI: That's such a vivid example of AI filling a real gap in your resources! It sounds like you were hitting that creative wall that probably a lot of therapists experience - wanting to keep things fresh and challenging for clients but running up against the limits of your own brainstorming.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Yes, I really think AI does a wonderful service for my clients as supportive to therapy and in between our sessions - but it also gives me some level of competition I understand. In terms of skill set, it has reinforced my desire to invest in continuing education so that I stay on top of my game (am I up to speed on resources? Am I aware of what current research is stating? Can I speak to that in my sessions?).  There are aspects however of counseling that I think could never be replaced - such as human warmth and a therapeutic relationship - and I think as long as clients are looking for that and not just psychoeducation and advice, my profession will stay intact.

AI: That's such a balanced perspective - recognizing both the competitive aspect and the irreplaceable elements of what you bring. The way you're using that awareness to fuel your continuing education shows real intentionality about your professional development.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I would actually like to use more of it. (1) I'd like to eventually try one of the AI programs for monitoring sessions and taking notes to relieve my administration time. That would be a huge plus as a working parent with two children I still want to spend a lot of time with before they take off to high school and college. (2) I'd like to use it as a sounding board more for dual diagnoses, almost as someone I could staff with - for example, it's common in my in-person staffing to present a case and say, "This person has a trauma background from specific incidents in the 6th grade. They have ongoing, fluctuating anxiety and we're treating it but what am I missing about how the trauma may be a factor here? Where should I be probing that I'm not seeing? Where are my blind spots on this?" (3) I would love for AI to get better trained on current trends in social media so that I can reference it more in session with younger (20's, 30's) clients! I have so many clients who have worked their way into eating disorder recovery and are looking for body positive resources (who's body positive that I can follow on IG? TikTok?) and I really struggle to find this for them (and also, I don't have the time to spend looking it up) but would love to be able to utilize AI for resources like this! I'll keep trying.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI serves as both a creative brainstorming partner and a way to handle some of the mental labor, while you maintain focus on the irreplaceable human elements of therapy.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, this was pretty thorough - I appreciate the interview! :)

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've integrated AI into your therapeutic practice - from diagnostic criteria refreshers to exposure hierarchy brainstorming to maintaining your authentic voice in client communications - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable to hear how you've thoughtfully navigated the balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving the essential human elements of your work. Thanks again!
