Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Happy with that. Please proceed.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I am a lawyer so I use AI to suggest clauses for inclusion in contracts, to review contracts and pick out key clauses of concern for our clients, compare two versions of a contract where one hasn't been redlined, to sense check clauses I've drafted and to draft emails to clients.

AI: That's a really comprehensive range of uses across different aspects of your legal work. 

When you're using AI for these contract-related tasks - like suggesting clauses or reviewing for key concerns - how do you typically work through that process? Do you find yourself going back and forth with the AI, refining things together, or do you more often give it a complete task and then work with what it produces?

User: I go back and forth with the model. For example, with suggesting clauses it is often too verbose or repetitive or includes superfluous provisions so I will get it to refine and edit the clause down for me until I'm happy with it.  For reviewing key issues in contracts I have found it is not 100% accurate and does miss key provisions, so I will test it by asking it to double check and confirm it has picked out every key legal risk for the client.  I do also review the contract myself against the output generated by the model due to the mentioned accuracy issues but the model speeds this up by making a good start for me.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you've developed quite a collaborative workflow where you're leveraging the AI's speed while compensating for its limitations with your expertise.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain legal tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I have found that AI is not very good with legislation and tends to hallucinate sections or make things up or confuse acts. So I still do that work myself.  I also don't tend to use it for writing emails to clients as I like to speak in my own written voice and style.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - both the precision required for legislation and maintaining your authentic voice with clients seem like areas where your personal touch is essential.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you noticed any particular attitudes or approaches within your firm that have shaped how you integrate these tools?

User: We have an in-house AI model built by our tech team so we can input confidential client information. We are encouraged to use it often to increase output and efficiency. We also have regular training sessions on how best to use it to max advantage and often share tips with each other on things we have found work well with it.

AI: That sounds like a very supportive and progressive environment for AI adoption. It's interesting that you have both the technical infrastructure with the in-house model and the cultural support through training and tip-sharing.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yes - we are a very forward thinking firm, which is great. I felt satisfied when I used AI to sense check a clause which was complex and had taken a while to draft. I put the clause into the model and asked it to explain it to me and note any potential issues and how the model explained it was exactly how I was intending the clause to work. I have also felt satisfied when I used it to prepare presentation talking points for me for an upcoming webinar I am giving and it suggested a few things I hadn't considered but which will be worth mentioning.  I have felt frustrated with it when I have asked it points of law and it gets them wrong.  This worries me as junior lawyers may use it for this and not know it is incorrect.

AI: That's a really telling contrast - the satisfaction when it confirms your expert thinking or expands your perspective, versus the frustration when it gets fundamental legal principles wrong, especially with the concern about junior colleagues potentially relying on incorrect information.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your work?

User: What do you mean by maintaining my skills where AI could take over?

AI: I'm asking about areas where AI is already helping you - like contract review or clause drafting. Do you think about making sure you stay sharp in those skills, or do you see AI as enhancing rather than potentially replacing your abilities in those areas?

User: Of course I do. I see AI as an enhancement not a replacement and even if I ask it to draft something for me I will assess it's output critically like I would when reviewing work sent to me by another lawyer. Whilst AI is very good an appearing confident in its answers, I don't just accept it's output at face value. This is also one of the reasons I challenge it to double check things.

AI: That critical assessment approach really comes through in how you described your process earlier. 

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing in particular ways as the technology develops or as you become more experienced with it?

User: I see it as continuing along a collaborative approach and using it to make my day to day work faster, especially with administrative tasks.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on developing that collaborative workflow where you're leveraging AI's speed while maintaining critical oversight, and your concern about junior lawyers potentially accepting incorrect legal information at face value.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Nope that's it.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've developed this collaborative approach - going back and forth to refine outputs, double-checking for accuracy, and maintaining that critical assessment mindset - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
