Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI in my work almost every day. Most of my interactions are centered around communicating effectively with clients, whether generating emails or quotes for jobs, and developing social media and advertising content. Sometimes I use AI to help me quickly find information about specific products or techniques, look for historic hardware, or even come up with unique ideas for projects. This often saves time, although it is more useful in some situations than others.

AI: That's really helpful - it sounds like AI has become quite integrated into your daily routine. You mentioned that it's more useful in some situations than others. 

Can you tell me more about what makes the difference? When do you find AI most helpful versus when does it fall short?

User: Well, sometimes there are accuracy issues when searching for products, but often I find something similar from the suggestions, so overall this has been very helpful. In other situations, I have taken pictures of upcoming projects and asked for suggestions. At times, these have been very useful, but in other situations the suggestions were not useful. This is more hit or miss and often depends on what the client is looking for in the finished product. For the most part, when asking for project suggestions, I can often use pieces of the suggestions, but I am still very involved in developing the final product. Sometimes the suggestions won't work due to space limitations or other constraints or require modification to be useful. Is that specific enough?

AI: Yes, that's very specific and helpful! I'm getting a clearer picture of how you navigate those different outcomes with AI suggestions.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Yes, definitely. I would say that is an accurate statement. I would consider my work artistic. I specialize in historic restoration and creating unique finishes. This is not an aspect that AI can really help with beyond project planning. For example, if a client is seeking a faux finish that creates a weathered wood look, AI can make suggestions on how to achieve the look with paint colors and techniques; however, ultimately, the human element is key to creating a beautiful finish, and experience using various techniques, products, and colors cannot be replaced. So for project planning and content creation for social media and communication with clients, AI is superb, but as far as achieving the final product, that can't be replaced by AI.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction - it sounds like there's something fundamentally irreplaceable about the hands-on artistic execution that comes from your experience and human intuition.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I am more inclined to collaborate throughout the task. If I'm creating social media content or communications with clients, I may have AI generate a first draft, then edit to add my own personal touch and have AI check it over for me. If I'm searching for information about products or specific pieces, I often allow AI to provide the information, then revise my search or information requests based on the AI response. I don't really delegate tasks but more often work in a collaborative manner with AI

AI: That collaborative approach sounds really dynamic - like a back-and-forth conversation where you're building on each other's contributions. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I own my business, so this question  doesn't really seem highly relevant to me. My company is very small-only 2 employees besides me, and they are more involved in support roles for project completion. That being said, I see value in using AI, so I guess it is more of my personal experience from interacting with AI that influences my continued use.

AI: That makes perfect sense - as a business owner, you have the freedom to integrate AI based on what works for you personally rather than navigating workplace policies or peer pressure.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Well one project that stands out was creating live edge shelving the corner of a client's tiny home. There was some asymmetry in the corner, but it could not be changed due to the physical constraints of the tiny home. I was having a difficult time creating a look that disguised the asymmetry to the client's satisfaction. I took a picture of the corner and had an AI generate an image of the live edge shelves arranged to offset the asymmetry. The image was not perfect, but it adequately resolved the issue, allowing for me to complete a mock-up that completely satisfied the customer's request. I struggled to find a solution, but within just a few minutes, AI found a solution that was functionally perfect and gave me the assistance I needed.

AI: That's such a compelling example - it sounds like AI helped you break through a creative block that was really challenging you. The fact that it could quickly visualize a solution that worked despite the physical constraints must have been incredibly satisfying.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: Like I said before, there are aspects of my job that I believe will always require a human touch. I don't have the same concerns as some other businesses or industries may. From my perspective, AI only enhances my work, often making it less time consuming. This includes from an administrative perspective, as well as from a creative perspective when planning projects. While there is definitely room for improvements in the areas that AI can assist me in my business, I find that I spend much less time on administrative tasks than in the past, and this has extended into project planning as well.

AI: That's a really balanced perspective - it sounds like you see AI as freeing up your time for the parts of the work that truly require your expertise and artistry.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I foresee continued use at a similar level in the areas I have already mentioned. I believe that AI will become even more capable in the areas of project planning, especially with regard to accuracy. One of the biggest issues I've experience when utilizing AI for project planning is that often the suggestions are not accurate with regard to measurements or placement. For example, in one project, I was building a window awning that was very close to an adjoining roofline. The AI provided an image that was perfect with regard to the aesthetics desired by the client; however, the suggestion was ultimately useless because the placement of the window and roofline made its completion impossible. I have no doubt that accuracy in this type of situation will improve in the future. And, I look forward to those improvements because it will be useful to my work and allow me to more efficiently complete projects.

AI: That measurement and spatial constraint issue is really interesting - it shows how even when AI gets the creative vision right, those practical details matter enormously in your field.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI enhances rather than replaces the irreplaceable human elements of your artistic restoration work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I can't think of anything else. Hopefully this information is specific enough to be highly useful!

AI: It absolutely is - your insights have been incredibly specific and useful! The way you've described that collaborative relationship with AI, especially in creative problem-solving like the tiny home shelving project, really illustrates how AI can enhance rather than replace specialized expertise. Your perspective as a business owner in a hands-on artistic field gives us valuable insights into how AI integration looks when someone has full autonomy over their tools and processes.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
