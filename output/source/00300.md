Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good, let's begin.

AI: Great! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: For work, I mostly use an AI-powered app to plan delivery routes. I input all the addresses, and the AI optimises the route for efficiency. Working in a pharmacy, we also occasionally use basic AI tools like Google Gemini to provide summaries of medication uses and interactions.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're using AI for both logistical optimization and clinical support. 

When you're using that route planning app, how does the interaction typically work? Do you just input the addresses and let it handle everything, or do you find yourself making adjustments to what it suggests?

User: I never have to make adjustments. I do check the output when it's done, but I haven't had any issues yet. It's quite effective and saves me a lot of time.

AI: That's impressive that it's been so reliable for you. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: AI could probably help me with drafting correspondence, or at least I could have used this heavily in my last office role, but I've always preferred to do this myself to ensure that the note or email sounds like it's coming from me, specifically.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - maintaining your personal voice and authenticity in communications. 

Tell me more about that. What is it about your own writing style or approach that you feel is important to preserve when communicating with others?

User: I think that, particularly in situations where I have an established relationship with someone, I want to maintain continuity of personality. I've also found that I have a different manner of speaking than what I've found from the AI models I've employed in the past. I guess I just use a different vocabulary. I'm autistic, so I find authenticity in my communication to be highly important.

AI: That's a really valuable insight about authenticity and continuity in relationships. It sounds like maintaining that personal connection through your unique communication style is something you prioritize.

When you do use AI for work - like with the medication summaries you mentioned - how do you typically interact with it? Do you collaborate back and forth to refine the information, or do you tend to ask for what you need and use it as-is?

User: I tend to ask one question, and if I have further queries, I'll check any links provided to reputable sources. As a pharmacy assistant, I'm not authorised to give definitive personal medication advice to our customers, but I do like to know the answer for myself, and to give the pharmacist something to start with, as I'm the go-between for them and the customer.

AI: That's a thoughtful approach - using it as a starting point for your own understanding while respecting the boundaries of your role. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have there been any discussions about it, or particular attitudes that have shaped how you approach these tools?

User: I don't recall any specific discussions in my current role. We don't use AI tools heavily in our store. In my previous industry, there was lots of discussion about it, and there are still many people heavily against it.

AI: What was your previous industry, and what kinds of concerns were people raising about AI? What drove that resistance you experienced?

User: I used to work in a branch of property management called Owners Corporation Management in Australia. Our jobs are (/were in my case), heavily administerial, even at the higher levels of management. The workdays would involve a lot of written communication in various forms. Before AI, my office would try to keep templates for every type of letter or form or email, and since the advent of AI, a lot of this can be automated. I know a lot of people are still not comfortable with this, and prefer to do it all themselves from scratch. The one thing I found it particularly useful for was language translation. I worked in an area with a significant Chinese population, so we would often need to provide a Mandarin translation of our communications. Obviously, that can present issues with trust, as non-Chinese speakers don't know whether or not it's correct.

AI: That's a fascinating contrast - moving from an industry where AI could handle so much of the routine work to one where it's barely used. 

You mentioned the translation work was particularly useful but raised trust issues. Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I'm not sure I've ever been particularly frustrated by it myself, but the time saving that AI can provide can be satisfying, especially if I don't know where to look for an answer in the first place.

AI: That's a great point about AI helping when you don't even know where to start looking. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider, especially given your experience in that more administrative role?

User: I did used to think about this constantly, especially as (in a kind of lateral similarity) we began to hire offshore workers to assist with the more menial admin tasks, which came after 2 of our local admin team members were made redundant. I don't think that the majority of people in that OC industry will ever be replaceable by AI, though. The role of an OC manager is too heavily reliant on genuine, human interaction in customer service.

AI: That's a really insightful perspective - the distinction between tasks that can be automated and those core human relationship aspects that remain essential.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see yourself using it differently as these tools develop, or do you think you'll maintain a similar approach?

User: I'm not sure about using it differently, as I don't know what the future holds, either in our business, or for AI tools in general. I think, at least for the short-term future, I'll maintain the same approach I have now. I use it for the things I need a boost with, but I can easily verify if I need to.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on authenticity in communication and how the human relationship aspects of work remain so essential, even as AI handles more routine tasks.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, I can't think of anything else.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about maintaining authenticity, the importance of verification, and the distinction between automatable tasks and essential human interactions will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!

User: Bye!

AI: Bye! Take care!
