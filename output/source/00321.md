Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good.

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I own a candle business and I use AI quite often.  I used AI to create my logo and come up with a good business name.  I have repeatedly used AI to create product descriptions for my website.  AI calculates my wax to fragrance oil ratios for large batches of candles.  AI also assists with creating contracts for business purposes.  AI also drafts emails to potential customers.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like AI has become integrated across many different aspects of your candle business, from the creative side to the technical calculations to customer communications.

Tell me more about how you use AI for those wax to fragrance oil ratio calculations. How does that process work for you?

User: I let the AI know my formula for one candle and then it will calculate the numbers for numerous candles based on the initial calculation.  It is based on the amount of liquid my vessel (jar) will hold and 10% load of fragrance.

AI: That makes perfect sense - so you're essentially using AI as a scaling calculator to maintain your exact ratios when going from single candle production to larger batches.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your candle business you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: I have not been able to use AI to send emails or make appointments yet.  It would also be great to have AI dispurse social media posts with high SEO content on a planned basis.

AI: I hear you on those limitations - it sounds like there are some automation capabilities you'd like to have that aren't quite available to you yet.

But let me ask this a different way - are there aspects of your candle business that you actually prefer to keep doing yourself, even when AI could assist? For instance, do you handle the actual candle making process yourself, or customer service conversations, or maybe certain creative decisions?

User: I will always be making the candles obviously.  I'd have to get much, much bigger to incorporate AI (robots).  Hope I get there someday.  I also like to handle the customer service issues and inquiries myself.  I like to add the personal touch so the customer feels special.

AI: That personal touch with customer service makes a lot of sense - it sounds like maintaining that human connection is important to you and your brand.

When you do use AI for tasks like writing product descriptions or drafting emails, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to work back and forth with AI to refine the content, or do you tend to give it the task and use what it produces fairly directly?

User: I usually describe what I need in very descriptive detail and the AI usually provides what I need.  I always read over the content and there may be revisions needed.

AI: So it sounds like you provide detailed instructions upfront and then review and refine - that's a pretty efficient approach.

How have your colleagues or other business owners in your network influenced the way you use AI in your work? Have you learned about new ways to use it from others, or do you mostly figure things out on your own?

User: I watch YouTube videos of other candlemakers and use any tips and tricks that sound useful.  I also read AI newsletters from various content creators.  It helps me find the best new AI information and ways to use AI.

AI: That's smart - staying connected to both your industry community and the broader AI community to pick up new techniques.

Can you share a time when using AI for your candle business made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: It has been so helpful for AI to create my product descriptions.  This task can be so daunting and it has helped so much.  It makes updating my website so much quicker when I add new products.

AI: That sounds like it's been a real game-changer for you - turning what used to be a daunting task into something much more manageable.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI is helping you so much, like writing product descriptions? Is this something you actively consider, or are you comfortable letting AI handle more of that type of work?

User: I am pretty good at creative writing but it is so much quicker with AI.  I don't have to worry as much about grammar mistakes and the descriptions are always professional.  I will not miss these tasks at all because my love is making the candles.  The administrative tasks are not my favorite.

AI: That makes perfect sense - it sounds like AI is helping you focus more on what you're passionate about by taking care of the administrative work you find less enjoyable.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI evolving as your candle business grows? Are there new ways you hope to incorporate it, or areas where you think it might become even more helpful?

User: I would love to utilize AI for inventory and ordering.  It would also be helpful to add AI to edit and create reels and shorts.

AI: Those sound like natural next steps - especially the inventory management and social media content creation, which could really streamline your operations.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about how AI fits into your business. I particularly appreciated how clearly you articulated the distinction between the tasks you want to keep doing yourself - like the actual candle making and personal customer service - versus the administrative work where AI saves you time and lets you focus on your passion.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your candle business that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No thanks for the chat.

AI: Thank you so much for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly! Your insights about how AI helps you focus on the creative work you love while handling the administrative tasks have been incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Best of luck with your candle business - it sounds like you've found a really smart way to leverage AI to support your growth while keeping the personal touch that makes your business special.

Have a great day!
