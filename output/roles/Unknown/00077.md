Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sounds good! No questions

AI: Great! Let's dive right in then.

To start, I'd love to hear about your work. Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I worked on a qualitative survey analyzing the usage of HPV vaccines in chain-based pharmacies. The goal I had was to identify barriers  and facilitators that are present that would affect the impact that increasing HPV vaccination distribution in pharmacies would entail. I designed a survey and distributed it to a select group of parents and/or pharmacists to get their feedback on how to better assess these further

AI: That sounds like really important public health research. I can picture the survey design and distribution, but tell me more about that whole process - how did you go from having that initial goal of identifying barriers and facilitators to actually getting those responses from parents and pharmacists?

User: I made a brainmap of things that I believe aid or discourage a person to get vaccinated, then crossed that with things that a pharmacy could. I then looked into any prior research, as well as the legality behind pharmacists and pharmacy techs administering vaccines. I then wrote an abstract, designed the survey tool, and voila

AI: That's a really systematic approach - starting with your own brainstorming, then layering in the research and regulatory constraints. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I used AI extensively during the background research, as it helped me find sources and prior knowledge. I wasn't at the point of using it to help me write just yet.

AI: Tell me more about how you used AI for that background research - what did that look like in practice?

User: I basically just asked the AI to do a deep search into the topic, kind of like doing a google search. I'd ask it to focus on whatever specific state or vaccine I was initially looking at, before I settled on HPV focus.

AI: That's helpful context. For that background research phase where you used AI extensively, tell me about how you decided to use AI versus doing traditional literature searches or other research methods you might normally use.

User: Truthfully, AI was easier than doing a full library search on my own. It also helped me find a starting point, where I would then go and look for resources similar to the ones that the AI shared with me.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - using it as a launching pad rather than the final word. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process - like designing the actual survey questions, writing the abstract, or analyzing responses - what's kept you from trying AI there?

User: I'm not sure. I think it felt unethical? Like it wouldn't be my own work or something. Maybe thats just my student brain conditioned to think of using AI sources as something that's similar to cheating. I don't think the thought of using AI to help me refine the language ever really came to me

AI: That's a really honest reflection - it sounds like there's this tension between finding AI genuinely useful for research but having these ingrained feelings about academic integrity when it comes to the actual writing and analysis work.

When you did use AI for that background research and it was giving you sources and prior knowledge, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced?

User: I would always make sure that it produced valid links in the NCBI or NIH databases. I'd also read the articles myself, as I would be looking for data or quotes that I could refer to in my own work. This was especially important for my abstract writing.

AI: That verification approach sounds really thorough - checking those database links and reading the actual articles yourself.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: if you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Knowing now that I could use AI during other aspects of my research, I would definitely want to use AI in scientific writing such as abstracts, manuscripts, and conference submissions. I find it hard to use the best or most accurate terminology, and instead prefer to use my own writing voice that is often not as clear.

AI: That's such an insightful point about terminology and clarity in scientific writing - it sounds like you see a real gap between your natural writing voice and what's expected in scientific communication.

Those are all my main questions - your perspective on using AI as a research starting point while being thoughtful about verification was particularly interesting, as was your reflection on the academic integrity concerns around writing.

Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: uhm I dont think so

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a launching pad for research while maintaining rigorous verification practices, and your honest reflection about the tension between finding AI useful and those ingrained academic integrity concerns, really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

It's also fascinating how you've identified scientific writing as an area where AI could genuinely help bridge the gap between your natural voice and the precise terminology that scientific communication requires.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!
