Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Let's do it!

AI: Great! I love the enthusiasm. Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: My creative work focuses on content creation and design. For example , ghost writing a blog for my client about her makeup brand including tutorials, or like yesterday, it's meant creating PowerPoint slides for a company's marketing campaign proposals. Usually,  my work means that I will receive a file of info and need to filter, organize, format, and create another kind of content with it.

AI: That sounds like a really diverse range of creative work - from beauty tutorials to marketing presentations. It sounds like you're constantly transforming information from one format into something completely different.

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: There is always a specific goal that the company has in mind for a project and I'm either provided with an overload of information (60% of which is not relatable), or I'm receive too little info and need to be creative, yet accurate in statements, to fill in the space. In these cases, I reach for AI because it is a huge time-saver. I use it to sort through and compile the connected info to the task at hand and to adjust word/character count and formatting. Sometimes I receive a project in a category/on a topic that I have no previous knowledge of or little understanding of, so in these cases I reach for AI so I can ensure that what I put together does align with the company's objective for that content. Oh, and I should mention I'm a freelancer. That's why I'll end up working with a variety of  topics. If I receive too little info to work with but have a requested content length, then I use AI to get creative and fill in the gaps, while still ensuring that everything stated is accurate

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like AI becomes your go-to tool for both information overload and information scarcity situations. I'm particularly interested in what you mentioned about ensuring accuracy when filling in gaps creatively.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: For example, a client asked me to write makeup blogs for her products. Of these, a few times I was only provided with a picture and the name of the product. 700 words based on just that?? So, I used AI to brainstorm and compile info about the company (its objectives, history, ingredients, etc). The blog needed to have depth and accuracy of statement, not "fluff" or non confirmed statements, and so I brought in AI to help fill in the gaps creatively with what a consumer would find "trustworthy" information

AI: That's a fascinating example - going from just a product photo and name to a 700-word blog post that needs to be both engaging and trustworthy. It sounds like you were really relying on AI to help you understand the broader context around that product.

When you're working with AI in situations like that makeup blog, how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what is driving the creative decisions?

User: I feel in control of the collaboration. I give AI the parameters and its focus  point and it usually works within that. Some of the suggestions it'll provide are hit-or-miss aligned with the parameters it was given, but there's always something that is useful.

AI: That's interesting that you feel in control despite sometimes getting suggestions that miss the mark. It sounds like you're actively filtering and curating what AI gives you.

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: When it comes to copywriting, I've found that it's slowly changing my focus when creating content. I uses to think more about how the content would impact/move the viewer, but now I find myself more focused on making sure it doesn't read like AI was involved. Obviously, using AI makes everything easier and more efficient, so I find myself being lazy and less able to work create on my own like I had in the past. I feel like this effects the outcome of the work because I'm not as involved in the process of trying to create that connection of the audience with the content.

AI: That's a really honest and thoughtful reflection. It sounds like there's a real tension there - AI is making your work more efficient, but you're noticing it's changing how you approach the creative connection with your audience. You mentioned feeling "less able to work create on my own" - that sounds like something you've really noticed about yourself.

What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: AI will one day replace me! hahah

AI: Ha! I can hear that you're laughing, but I imagine there might be some real feelings behind that joke too.

Tell me more about that - when you think about AI potentially replacing you, what specifically comes to mind?

User: Even those with specialized training and skills, say computer science and coding for example, AI is even able to do their job (speaking generally here, not absolutely). So then you have someone like me, who just has my creativity, ability to write engaging content, and can create nice PowerPoints - no special education or skills - yet I've found this as a means to work and support myself. There's nothing stopping AI from eventually putting me out of work in these projects

AI: That's a really genuine concern, and I appreciate you sharing that vulnerability with me. It sounds like you're thinking about what makes your work uniquely valuable when AI can handle so much of what you do.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: Society is constantly evolving and this creates new needs and new opportunities. I believe that as long as I keep adapting, I'll be better able to incorporate using AI into my work and continue creating various forms of content in different fields.

AI: That's a really thoughtful way to look at it - focusing on adaptation rather than resistance. You've shared some really insightful perspectives about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your honesty about how AI has changed your focus from connecting with audiences to ensuring content doesn't read as AI-generated, and your genuine concerns about the future while maintaining an adaptive mindset.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: That's it! Thanks for the chat :)

AI: Perfect! Thank you so much for being so open and thoughtful in sharing your experiences. Your insights about navigating the balance between efficiency and authentic creative connection, along with your perspective on adaptation in an evolving field, will be incredibly valuable for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with me today. Take care!
