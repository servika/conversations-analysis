Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude, and I'm here representing Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today.

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Sure.  Lets begin

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I typically use it to help refine customer service responses,  condense information, and. help with excel formulas, and look up specific topics are some of the main ways I use it

AI: That's a nice range of different uses. When you mention refining customer service responses, what does that process typically look like for you?

User: Someone uses our contact form for an inquiry of theirs. I would have to respond, but if there is something more challenging, or I need to make sure my response doesn't put our company or. myself liable.  Another specific way I use it is if I need to politely decline thier request. I get it to help me refine my response.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - especially around liability concerns and finding diplomatic ways to decline requests. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Totally.  I prefer to do the majority of the writing myself, I only use AI to help refine it, but afterwards i still double check it and make sure it doesnt read like a robot. People reading the responses should get some form of personal feel, and not just a generic message.  Otherwise, quick research or even item look ups I use AI as i want to find the answer as quick as possible, something like math, or state taxes, although I still double check them typically. One thing that I would want to use it for more is scheduling and helping with app integration

AI: That's really interesting - you want to maintain that personal touch in your communications. When you say you double-check to make sure it doesn't "read like a robot," what are you looking for specifically? What tells you when something sounds too generic?

User: It uses a lot of emojis, sometimes even more large and complicated words or sentences that arent really needed. Or it really reiterates and summarizes the question that it has been given. I have even had it refer to a section that is not real

AI: Ah, so you're watching for overly formal language, unnecessary complexity, and even factual errors like referencing non-existent sections. That's valuable quality control.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: I dont typically ever delegate an entire task. That might be because of the integration into my work, or also the amount of info and forework that I would have to put into it to make sure it comes out correct and using proper language, items, yanno, work specific databases.

AI: That makes sense - the setup work to get it right might outweigh the time savings. So it sounds like you're more in a collaborative mode, working back and forth with it rather than handing off complete tasks.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: Exactly, plus I would have to read through it as well to make sure it is fact checked. Some of my colleagues use it, I would say almost all of us use it for personal use. And only myself and one or two others (out of 7) use it in a work capacity

AI: Interesting that there's such a split between personal and work use among your team. What do you think drives that difference - why are you and just a couple others using it for work while everyone uses it personally?

User: i think it is honestly just the type of work that we do. We have a specifically built computer system that we use as our database, which AI does not integrate with, and I dont even know how it would. The majority of AI work is done for matters outside of that program.

AI: That makes perfect sense - the lack of integration with your core work system is a real barrier. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yep. I think a satisfied example would be when i had to tell someone no to their request. They were being a big pain and i was getting frustrated, and i wrote the message how I felt and told AI to change it to a polite NO.  that was satifying.  A frustrating time was when i was using it for Excel, and it kept giving me a formula that didnt work with my data set... and it tried to refine it but it never worked. Gave up on that one

AI: Those are great examples - the contrast is really clear. For that Excel situation where it kept giving you formulas that didn't work, what do you think was going wrong there? Was it a data format issue, or something else about your specific setup?

User: possibly the setup, or I am not sure if excel can even do what I was asking it for. A lot of differnet. variables from a few data sets and I needed find the ones that matched. But they were almost each set had to match a set (or a column) of varibles

AI: That sounds like a complex matching problem across multiple datasets - definitely the kind of thing where the specifics of your data structure would matter a lot.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I dont understand the question

AI: Let me rephrase that. When you use AI to help with things like writing responses or Excel formulas, do you ever worry about getting rusty at those skills yourself? Or is that something you think about at all?

User: i dont know how to use excel so that is why i am relying on AI.  Otherwise, no I just use it for the seped

AI: Got it - so AI is actually helping you access capabilities you didn't have before with Excel, and for other things it's really about efficiency and speed.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: i think I will continue to use it and refine the ways I use it to make it work for me and what I need to get out of it

AI: That's all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that personal touch in customer communications and how you've found AI most useful as a collaborative tool rather than for complete task delegation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: Thanks, and no

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the balance between efficiency and personalization, the integration challenges with existing systems, and how you use AI as more of a collaborative partner will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

Have a great rest of your day!
