Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This conversation should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No, let's begin!

AI: Perfect! Let's dive right in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use AI to compare product descriptions of our ecommerce products to competitors to understand how we can better develop our product descriptions on ecommerce websites for consumers. I also use AI programmed with specific system instructions to help me answer routine customer service tasks, like responding to customers about difficult situations.

AI: That's really interesting - you're using AI for both competitive analysis and customer service. 

Tell me more about that customer service application. When you say you have AI programmed with specific system instructions for difficult situations, what does that interaction look like day-to-day?

User: Let's say that I have a customer who ordered something from me on Amazon and they say that they no longer need the item but want our company to pay for the shipping to return the item even though that type of return doesn't qualify for free return shipping. I program a specific AI like a Gemini Gem that has Amazon's return policies and customer policies referenced in the system instructions to assist me with that. This is particularly helpful for cases where we inform the customer that their return is no longer in the 30 day return window so it cannot be returned, but the customer gets agitated and starts sending e.g., threatening messages.

AI: That sounds like you're dealing with some really challenging customer interactions. When you're using that AI system with the policy instructions for these difficult situations, how do you typically work with it? Are you collaborating with the AI as you craft each response, or do you tend to give it the customer's message and let it draft a complete response for you to review?

User: I review the solution that the AI comes up with, but in difficult cases where I've exhausted all options, I look to AI for ways to de-escalate and resolve the problem. For routine things like inquiries about shipping policies, the AI does most of the work but I double check it.

AI: That makes sense - it sounds like you adjust how much you rely on the AI based on the complexity of the situation.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: I think there are some cases where the AI can lack nuance, especially in cases where a customer claims that they did not recieve and item while UPS shows that they delivered the item to the address that the customer provided. Or when a customer returns something but has used half the product and wants a full refund. Those are usually situations that I want to handle myself because they are often trying to inform the customer that they are wrong without making them upset -- and the goal is ideally to make them go away, but I always run it by my AI bot to see what they think.

AI: That's a really insightful distinction - those situations where you need to essentially tell someone they're wrong while keeping them as a customer. It sounds like you still consult with your AI even on those cases you prefer to handle yourself.

When you say you "always run it by my AI bot to see what they think" on those nuanced situations, what are you typically looking for from the AI in those moments?

User: I'm looking for them to judge the tone of my response to see if it's appropriate. I want it to be a formal response that doesn't come across as personal without being rude.

AI: That's a great use case - having the AI act as a tone check for your responses. It sounds like you've developed a pretty sophisticated workflow where you're leveraging AI's strengths while keeping human judgment at the center for the most delicate situations.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Are others in your company using similar approaches, or did you develop this system on your own?

User: I developed the system but it has greatly helped others in my organization handle routine customer service messages and emails. However, I always inform them to make sure that the AI they use is not intentionally running the customer around in circles and obviously obfuscating.

AI: That's interesting that you've shared your system with others but with that specific warning about not running customers in circles. 

Can you tell me more about what you mean by that - have you seen instances where AI responses might unintentionally make things more frustrating for customers rather than resolving their issues?

User: Well, like I said with the nuanced cases, the AI needs to show empathy towards the customer. I've encountered some Amazon customer support chatbots that intentionally try to redirect the user to instructions/policies that they've already read in an attempt to shut the conversation down without actually assisting the user.

AI: Ah, I see - so you're trying to avoid that frustrating experience where the AI just keeps pointing people back to policies without actually addressing their specific situation.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: We sent inventory to an Amazon Fulfillment Center and we needed the weight for the item to be updated to qualify for new storage rates. I performed the correct request for the weight and dimensions update but whoever was supposed to do the update at the warehouse just used the old weight and dimension values. When I contacted customer support about this, I was greeted with an AI who constantly referred me back to policies and said that I would need to send more items for it to be weighed without acknowledging that someone who works at Amazon did not actually weigh the product like they were supposed to (possibly out of incompetence or laziness). The AI would not sympathize or help me resolve my problems by understanding that I had a unique situation and instead just kept instructing me to do the same thing that I've already done (i.e., send more inventory to be weighed).

AI: That sounds incredibly frustrating - you had a legitimate issue where someone at Amazon made an error, but the AI support just kept giving you the standard response without recognizing your specific situation.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I catch enough mistakes with the AI to know that it's there to augment my abilities and I don't fear them taking them over.

AI: That confidence from catching AI mistakes makes a lot of sense - you're seeing firsthand where the technology still needs human oversight.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: Ideally I'd like to have a database with a custom AI that is specifically built for our company, with knowledge of our products, processes, workflow, inventory, etc.

AI: That sounds like a natural next step from the custom system instructions you're already using - scaling it up to encompass your entire business operations.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated how you've developed this nuanced approach where you use AI differently depending on the complexity and sensitivity of each customer situation.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as both a collaborative partner and a tone-checker, while maintaining human judgment for the most sensitive customer interactions, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
