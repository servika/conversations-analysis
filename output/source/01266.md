Assistant: Hi there, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your research work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

To start, could you walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: I was working on getting ideas for a dissertation I have in mind for the treatment of C. difficile

AI: That sounds like important research. Tell me more about that process - how did you go about developing and exploring those ideas for your C. difficile treatment dissertation?

User: I am still mulling over the type of dissertation (i.e, the methodology and structure) I would like to do.  I know it will be a masters level thesis so my main focus would be researching peer reviewed studies on c.diff treatments.  So I researched "getting ideas for a thesis on c.diff treatment peer review".  The NIH had several studies of interest.  I selected five studies, copied and pasted their summaries into AI and asked it to compare and contrast the summaries by having it use key words such as "treatment", "patient response", " further research" etc.  I used the results of this to generate a series of interesting questions for myself to explore further.

AI: That's a really helpful overview of your process. You mentioned using AI to compare and contrast those five study summaries - tell me more about how you decided to use AI for that particular step versus analyzing those summaries yourself in your traditional way.

User: Having AI search for keywords reduced the time I would have taken to read the papers.  It helped me hone in on the papers/paragraphes that were specific to my goal.

AI: That makes sense - the time savings and focus seem really valuable. When you had AI analyze those summaries and it generated results highlighting treatment, patient response, and further research themes, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced before using those insights to generate your research questions?

User: If a reference was provided by the authors, I would go to the bibliography in the paper, find the research title, look for it online and read it.  If there were something of real interest in the actual study, I would search for the keyword (or now a phrase related to the word) in the paper to find out how the "conclusion" was generated from the study's results.

AI: That's a thorough verification approach. We're about halfway through our conversation now. 

Thinking about the other parts of your research process for this dissertation - like developing your methodology, structuring your thesis, or writing sections - what's kept you from trying AI in those areas, if anything?

User: I haven't begun developing my methodology as yet as I am still at the "Defining my thesis statement".  However, I did not use AI to generate my list of research ideas because it is what interests my and where my personal strengths lie that will help me determine my statement. Looking forward, I will use AI to help me find more connections (similar studies) to my statement.

AI: That's really insightful - it sounds like you see a clear distinction between where your personal interests and judgment are essential versus where AI can help with information discovery and connections.

If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research process that it currently doesn't help with, what would that be and why?

User: Maybe it would be useful to know what areas of research need more research (what is a unique, less studied area of research) so that I could be more confident that I am conducting a study on a topic that is not already well-studied and one that will be helpful to the community.

AI: That's a really thoughtful wish - identifying research gaps and ensuring your work contributes something genuinely new to the field. That would certainly help with confidence in your research direction.

We're wrapping up now, and your perspectives on using AI strategically for information processing while keeping personal judgment central to defining your research focus have been particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I think it is important to remember that AI is a tool that can be helpful, and it should be embraced as such. However, I am cautious about using it because sometimes I have found that it makes up research (even with citations), so it becomes a more onerous task if I am asking AI to come up with "original ideas".  For now, I will stick to having it help me make connections/analyze already published papers so that I can verify the research myself.

AI: Thank you so much for sharing your experiences so openly today. Your insights about using AI strategically as a verification-friendly tool while being appropriately cautious about its limitations - especially that distinction between using it for analysis versus original idea generation - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work.

Your approach of leveraging AI's strengths in pattern recognition and connection-making while maintaining rigorous verification practices seems like a thoughtful way to integrate these tools into research workflows.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you again for your time and valuable perspectives!

User: thanks! bye!

AI: You're very welcome! Thank you again for participating - your insights were really valuable. Take care and best of luck with your C. difficile research! Bye!
