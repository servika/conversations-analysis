Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds good, no questions.

AI: Perfect, thank you. Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I split my time between part-time work as a freelance writer, and volunteer work where I'm mostly writing fundraising bids for a charity.

I use AI extensively in both of those contexts, and for more general organisation and education purposes related to that work.

In terms of writing, here's a brief list of the kinds of tasks I use AI for:

* Idea generation - I have lengthy prompts set up in ChatGPT Projects that I reuse for generating ideas based on topics and other information I input. Typically I'll ask for a working title and a short bulleted outline at this stage.
* 'Workshopping' ideas - this usually takes the form of a to-and-fro conversation with AI where I share my thoughts on the piece we're working on, and get feedback and suggestions. At this stage I'm often looking for the AI partner to nudge me to more divergent thinking, and away from the obvious suggestions.
* Refining a draft - I'll paste in a rough draft and get feedback from the AI. This goes through several stages. I ask for an initial pass dealing with content and structure, to make sure I'm not missing anything obvious that should be included, and that the overall organisation works. After that I'll make changes and paste the draft back in, this time asking for line-by-line feedback that's similar to a copy editor's role. I'll pick and choose which changes I want to make, and will sometimes ask for clarification on why the model is suggesting a particular change (em-dashes are a particularly contentious point here, because I don't like to use them, but all AI models seem to love them). Sometimes this takes a few more iterations. Eventually I get to a point where I'm just asking for a final polishing draft.
* Generating formulaic content - some clients have specific rules around meta-titles, alt text etc, so I keep prompts set up specifically to generate those based on the client's preferences. For example, one client always wants five topics for their Medium posts, three popular, 'big' tags and two with a smaller, more niche following. So, I spent time building a prompt that asks specifically for tags that are verified as existing on Medium, and suggesting the appropriate ratio of popular to niche. I have lots of prompts like that that work on a single, clearly-defined task.
* For bid-writing, I like to use AI to filter the information provided by the organisation, and turn it into a format that's easier for me to process. I'll often ask for a bulleted list overview of what types of projects they're looking to fund, and a clear list of actions to take to build the application. During the application writing process, I'll usually go through a similar process to that outlined above, for my freelance clients, but will keep substantial amounts of information in the files of a Project as context.
* I'm still learning the whole fundraising thing, so have been working through an online course to learn those skills. I use Tana to organise myself generally, and have set up an AI workflow for courses. It transcribes the lesson as I watch it, and combines the transcript with my own notes to generate a summary, and then uses all of that as context so I can talk with the AI specifically about the course. I use that as a way to insert new learning into existing workflows, and to refresh my memory about relevant sections of the course while I'm writing new bids.

AI: That's a fascinating range of uses - you've really developed some sophisticated workflows. I'm particularly intrigued by how you've structured those different stages of the writing process with AI.

When you're going through that workshopping phase where you're having that back-and-forth conversation and looking for the AI to push you toward more divergent thinking, what does that interaction actually look like? How do you guide it to give you the kind of nudging you're after rather than obvious suggestions?

User: That usually looks quite conversational. I'll start a new chat for each new piece of content, but I'm working within a ChatGPT Project, so it already has context around the client's business, audience etc. I'll give it the headline and some brief notes, and then say something like, "But I feel like this is kind of cliched and stale at the moment, I need to make it more specific, less obvious examples." Then I'll proceed like that, back and forth, with the AI offering suggestions, which sparks ideas from me. I write a lot about self-care and mental health for mums, and I notice it often takes a while to nudge any AI model to go beyond bubble baths and yoga. Sometimes I'll give a list at the start of the conversation and say, "Don't use any of these examples."

AI: That's really insightful - you've essentially trained yourself to anticipate where the AI will default to generic responses and proactively steer it away. The "don't use these examples" approach is clever.

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. You mentioned you pick and choose which changes to make during the line-editing phase and sometimes push back on suggestions like em-dashes. Are there certain aspects of your writing tasks that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them?

User: I enjoy writing, so I always like to draft myself and get feedback from the AI, rather than having the AI draft for me. But I really value the suggestions, and find it helps make my writing tighter. I used to use the Hemingway app online to help with this, but find that I've mostly replaced it with AI now. I don't use em-dashes at all in my writing, I feel like that's maybe a British thing, but all the AI models I've tried seem to love them. I'd always rather use a comma, split into two sentences, or use a colon or semi colon as appropriate.

AI: That's a clear distinction - you want to maintain ownership of the creative drafting process but leverage AI as a sophisticated editing partner. It sounds like you've found a sweet spot where you're collaborating rather than delegating the core writing.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? It sounds like you lean heavily toward that collaborative approach throughout tasks rather than handing off complete tasks - is that accurate, or does it vary depending on what you're working on?

User: Yes, that's accurate, definitely more collaborative. I usually have an AI assistant open on one screen, and a Google Doc or Tana open on the other, and spend a lot of time copy-pasting between the two.

AI: That dual-screen setup really captures the collaborative nature of how you work. It sounds like you've developed quite an integrated workflow.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you're doing freelance writing and volunteer work, I'm curious if client expectations or the charity environment has shaped how you approach using these tools.

User: My clients vary in terms of their approach to AI. I have one who has a blanket no-AI policy, which I obviously respect. Mostly, though, clients don't mind how I work, they just want the finished product to be good. At this point, I can't feed a prompt in and get an article out and ship it as is, so the collaborative approach works well. I've shared prompts with clients before, particularly for those little tasks that suck a lot of time but don't require much creativity, like writing meta-titles. They're often surprised by the ways you can use AI other than just expecting it to magically produce a finished product.

The charity I work with is an adventure playground with a small staff team. So, there's very limited capacity from the paid staff's point of view, and bid writing is typically a lengthy, involved process. I'm trying to shift them towards using AI judiciously in the process, but that's a struggle. They're very attached to their email/Word document workflow, which is, from my viewpoint, outdated, clumsy, and inefficient. Again, though, they don't care how I do things, they just care about the result. I'm attending a webinar from Charity Excellence around using AI for bid writing soon, and am hoping my notes from that will encourage a shift.

AI: That contrast between your highly optimized AI workflow and the charity's traditional approach is really striking. It sounds like you're almost acting as a bridge between different approaches to technology adoption.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: Yesterday was very frustrating. I was using ChatGPT 5 to work on some shortform client content, and it was full of em-dashes (sorry, I know I keep going on about these!!) I reminded it about our rule, and asked it to redo the piece without them. It removed the em-dashes, but for some reason, also removed all the apostrophes, converting all the contractions into their full form. Don't -> Do not, etc. It took a full five turns to correct this, with the AI removing ALL the punctuation at one point.

In terms of satisfaction, I think the first time I got my Tana workflow set up for online courses. When I realised it actually worked, and how helpful it was, that was a big moment. It's completely changed the value I get from courses and webinars, because I have an easy way to translate what I'm learning into actionable notes.

AI: That punctuation battle sounds maddening! It's interesting how even sophisticated AI can get stuck in these odd loops where fixing one thing breaks something else entirely.

The contrast with your Tana breakthrough is striking - that moment when a workflow actually clicks and transforms how you approach learning. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: I'm not worried about AI taking my job, but I am aware that people using AI could take my job. So, I try to keep iterating on my processes, to keep challenging myself to find ways to use AI. I follow [REDACTED], and have bought her course. She uses a lot of AI in her workflow, and I take inspiration from that. Mostly, though, it's about stepping back and looking at what I'm doing regularly, and figuring out where AI can fit into that.

AI: That's a nuanced way to think about it - the distinction between AI itself versus people who are more skilled at leveraging AI is really insightful. It sounds like you're staying ahead by continuously evolving your processes rather than just protecting existing ways of working.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I definitely see myself continuing to use it. At the moment I use ChatGPT 90% of the time, simply because that's the product I have a paid subscription to. I've played with Claude through Tana quite a bit though, and really like the prose style of its output. So, going forward I might use agents set up in Tana more frequently, so I can have a project set up but use different AIs for different use cases. For example, I find Gemini adequate for repetitive tasks like writing meta-titles, and it's 'cheap' in terms of the number of credits it uses in Tana, but I'd likely use Claude if I wanted a finished piece of content written.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being more concerned about people using AI taking your job rather than AI itself - that's a really sharp distinction that I think captures something important about how this technology is actually reshaping work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, nothing else. Thank you.

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about developing those sophisticated collaborative workflows, the practical challenges like the em-dash battles, and how you're thinking strategically about staying competitive - all of that will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you walking me through your process in such detail. Take care!
