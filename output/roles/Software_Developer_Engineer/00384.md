Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments.

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions. Let's proceed.

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I work in an office setting. A large portion of my job is financial data analysis and understanding federal regulations. I often use AI in my day job to ask questions about federal regulations that I don't fully understand, or to help me locate federal regulations. I also use AI to assist with certain formula and formatting questions for excel. More recently, I've been using AI to help me when I get stuck making tables in PowerPoint.

AI: That's really helpful context. When you're working with those federal regulations, can you walk me through what that process typically looks like? Do you find yourself going back and forth with AI to clarify things, or are you usually able to get what you need in one interaction?

User: I work with 2 CFR Part 200 the most. I may ask if something would be considered an allowable expense, or ask it to narrow down a specific code in the uniform guidance that mentions a specific expense. When it comes to this I'm usually able to get what I need in one interaction. Recently I needed helping creating an escape room in a box activity for a work event. For that one we went back and forth a lot. So with financial and regulatory things I get my answers right away, but more creative tasks needed some back and forth.

AI: That's a fascinating distinction between how you interact with AI for regulatory work versus creative tasks. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Determining formulas for excel i prefer regular Internet searches or just asking Microsoft help in the program. The excel responses related to formulas often try to create things for me which isn't what I want.

AI: That's interesting - so the AI trying to create the formulas for you actually gets in the way of what you're looking for. 

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern with those regulatory questions? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete questions for it to handle independently?

User: I like to collaborate. One example is when I asked if gift cards could be given as a bonus to staff. Whether or not this is allowable really depends. AI gave me some circumstances when it would be allowable and other cases it wouldn't be. I used the source information the AI had and researched further myself. So AI didn't fully answer the question on the prompt(because it's situational it couldn't), but was able to tell me where to look for determine the answer.

AI: That sounds like a really effective partnership - AI pointing you toward the right sources and considerations, then you doing the deeper analysis. 

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: I have to be careful. I work with confidential information at times, so anything I ask must not contain confidential information.

AI: That makes sense - having to be mindful about confidentiality would definitely shape how you approach using AI.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: The escape room in a box activity was super helpful! I'm an analytical person so creative tasks aren't my strong point. AI helped me with my premise and the clues needed for the activity while keeping them within the theme of the world activity. One of the clues was a riddle k created myself, and I used AI to find tune it to sound nice. I would have struggled with that task on my own, so AI really came in clutch on that one.

AI: That sounds like a really satisfying collaboration where AI complemented your strengths perfectly! The riddle fine-tuning detail is particularly interesting.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: No. Overall, my line of work hasn't embraced AI and due to the nature, it won't anytime soon. I'm in health and human services and at that end of the day, human touch is required, even for a financial and data driven role like mine.

AI: That perspective about the human touch being essential in health and human services is really insightful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think I will use it more as I'm introduced to more programs and software. Training happens, but because it's a coordinated effort, I may have to use a program before I am officially trained. I can see AI helping bridge that learning gap.

AI: That's a really practical way to think about AI as a learning bridge during those transition periods.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on how AI helps you navigate regulatory complexities while you maintain the final analytical judgment, and how it's becoming a creative partner for tasks outside your usual strengths.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: I've suffered from imposter syndrome a lot on my role..I started less than a year ago, and it's an important role. AI has helped me learn a lot and helped build my confidence.

AI: That's such an important insight - thank you for sharing that. It sounds like AI has become not just a practical tool but also a confidence-building partner as you've grown into your role. That human element of how AI can support someone's professional development journey is really valuable for us to understand.

Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about the different ways you collaborate with AI - from regulatory research to creative projects to building confidence in a new role - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.
