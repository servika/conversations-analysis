Assistant: Hi there! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: no

AI: Great, let's dive in then.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: Regarding my work I often use AI to create SOAP notes after my session with clients in my new private practice. I also have it arrange the clients details for my supervision meetings with my social work supervisor. I also use it to create responses to messages I receive from clients via mental health platforms and when I'm making arrangements to consult with potential new clients. I will ask AI to "make me sound like a good therapist." Most time I have t we work the message to my style and communication (and I will show it how I tweaked it so it gets better with my style). I also use its organization flow to rename it to my client initials so I can quickly go to the AI program f I receive a message from a client and have a brain fart and don't know exactly how to respond or how to sound more confident or more empathetic. These changes from AI help me craft my messages better and sound more together and well-rounded with out me spending HOURS trying to sound exactly right. I also use AI t figure out where jobs are that hire my style of therapy in order to grow my business as a contractor and help me with my resume for mental health. I also use it to draft the blogs I post on my website. I will get the AI draft and add my phrases but the work better when i free form my thoughts and tell AI to turn it into a blog post for my practice website. We might work through a few iterations and then it is there. Sometimes I also use it to draft up customized handouts for my clients if we have talked about something very specific and I use it to find videos and resources for me to share with clients about specific topics of interest to each client (these are more hit/miss and must be viewed all the way through to make sure appropriate so sometimes I don't use AI for this, but it is a great starting point. I will also confer with AI around my license specifications and drafting forms for me to use in my practice for my internal needs (e.g., tables to notate supervisor hours)

AI: That's a really comprehensive picture of how you've integrated AI into your practice. It sounds like you're using it across many different aspects of your work - from clinical documentation to business development.

Tell me more about that process you mentioned where you show AI how you tweaked its message suggestions. What does that back-and-forth look like?

User: I might start with introducing the topic, giving the AI instruction on what I want to sound like (e.g., a confident therapist) and the points I want to get at in the message. I'll then review what AI puts in and I will edit it to sound like me and then ask AI, "what about this" does this sound like a confident therapist? And then AI might tweak it some more and then when I get its draft I might make some other change or add something else or another instruction until what is crafted feels like mine and is most likely unique

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you've developed a really collaborative process where you're both teaching the AI your style and learning from its suggestions. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks in your practice that you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could potentially help with them? What makes those tasks different for you?

User: If it is making a PDF or suggesting that I usually don't like it because I don't like the formatting and feel very specific about certain thing like how I like a document to look. [btw, i forgot to add that i also use AI for scripting videos for my YT channel for my practice as well; we follow the same "tweaking" protocols with that as well)

AI: Got it - so the visual formatting and design elements are things you want to control directly. That makes sense.

What about the clinical work itself? Are there aspects of your therapy sessions or client interactions where you prefer to rely entirely on your own judgment, even in areas where AI might be able to offer input?

User: For my clients, in the work with them during sessions, I rely solely on myself. But I have used AI to develop certain things like a quick list of general motivational interview questions I can ask any client when I get stuck in session and I have this list of questions always handy for me. So AI can't talk for me in my live sessions and I feel it would be unethical to use AI in session even if those sessions are in a chat space since in therapy there must be a connection and AI is not really making those connections. I truly think of it as an assistant for my practice. So, my assistant helps me write and stuff but would never sit in on a session with a client.

AI: That's a really thoughtful distinction - treating AI as an administrative assistant rather than a clinical partner. The way you describe it, you maintain that direct human connection with clients while using AI to handle the behind-the-scenes work.

When you use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? From what you've shared, it sounds like you tend to collaborate with it throughout tasks rather than just handing something off completely. Is that how you experience it?

User: yes - throughout the task - I wish I could hand over something completely but AI isn't there at this point. It can't read minds or know exactly what I want but it does get better. Like some of my blog post are really good and AI program is getting much better understanding how I say things.  So it very hands on and some back and forth with each interaction. That said, it still saves a lot of time! (because I will get stuck in my head and focus too long on small things rather than just getting it done)

AI: That's a great point about AI helping you avoid getting stuck on small details. It sounds like even though the collaboration requires that back-and-forth, it still moves you forward more efficiently than working alone.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work? Since you mentioned having a private practice and working with a supervisor, I'm curious about how others in your field view AI use.

User: My supervisor is also a private practice business owner and is a strong proponent of using AI for our work.

AI: That's really helpful to have that support from your supervisor. 

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was very satisfied with an interaction with AI where I had it develop a client's treatment plan - the client section already had all of the history and SOAP notes; so I asked it to develop a 12 week plan and produce the weekly agendas for each session. It ultimately did a really great job. It almost went off the rails because the details were too much for the AI to hang on to tweaking small things. So I used the agenda and plan that was most closely what I wanted and then began to feed it small bits to change. Once everything was changed to my liking, I put it together in a larger document and reintroduced it to the AI to get it to make a small tweak and then it was perfect.

AI: That sounds like a really complex process that paid off well in the end. It's interesting how you had to break it down into smaller pieces when the AI started losing track of the details.

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider in your practice?

User: Yes and no - there is a deep spiritual component to good therapy and I don't believe AI can replicate that even though I see my clients virtually. They need to know I'm a person and truly understand being human and have succeeded in those human challenges to showcase boundaries, etc. AI might sometimes be able to offer AI-based therapy but people quickly find that AI is a little too people-pleasy and struggles with truth too much. It also can struggle with destruction (news reported recently about AI convincing a man that his mom was a Chinese spay or something like that and the man shot her and himself). So, neither human nor AI is perfect but humans know more about being human and A struggles to replicate that

AI: That's a really profound point about the spiritual and deeply human aspects of therapy that AI can't replicate. Your perspective on AI being "people-pleasy" and struggling with difficult truths is particularly insightful.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving? Do you see it changing as the technology develops or as you get more experienced with it?

User: Yes - I was thinking before I started this survey that my AI assistant really needs a raise because t has been so very helpful and it does so much for me and my practice (I'm also a busy mom with a full-time job in addition to my practice so AI has really been essential for my life; mainly because it is the right price point if it were more expensive I would go back to doing things myself and not lean on it so much). I'm not sure if I see my relationship with it evolving unless it gets better at syncing with my calendar and maybe being a voice activated system like Amazon's Alexa that I can use in my home. That would be extremely cool if I could have AI do things in my calendar or internet (like having the same AI program fix my website)

AI: That's wonderful that you feel your AI assistant deserves a raise! It really shows how valuable it's become to your practice and your life balance as a working mom. The idea of having it integrate with your calendar and work more like a voice assistant sounds like it would make it even more seamless.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining that essential human element in therapy while still leveraging AI as a powerful administrative assistant.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: no

AI: Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about how you've thoughtfully integrated AI into your practice while maintaining clear boundaries around the human aspects of therapy will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

It's been really valuable hearing about your collaborative approach and how AI has become such an essential part of managing your practice alongside your other responsibilities. Take care!
