Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your scientific work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how scientists like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your research work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in scientific fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: No questions, I am ready to begin

AI: Perfect! Let's dive in.

Walk me through a recent research project you've worked on - what did that process look like from initial idea to final output?

User: The last (finished) research project I have worked on was looking at serum metabolites in Jersey and Holstein calves, and seeing how socialization impacted their nutrition and growth

AI: That sounds like a fascinating study! Can you walk me through what that research process actually looked like day-to-day? How did you go from that initial idea about socialization's impact on calf nutrition and growth to your final results?

User: Yes, I was actually piggy-backing off of a different student and professor project that was measuring behavior and socialization.  While I was helping monitoring the behaviors of calves in playgroups some serum samples were taken from the calves, and I used those to gather my data.  They were taken pretty much every week, and I used those samples to run assays like BHB and Haptoglobin, as well as looking at the weekly weigh-ins for each of the calves.

AI: So you had this opportunity to use existing samples and data from the behavioral study - that's a smart approach! Tell me more about what happened after you collected all that assay data and weight measurements. How did you go about analyzing everything and putting together your findings?

User: This project was a bit too small to write a paper (the main project did get published however), but I did present a poster.  I used R to do most of the data analysis, and excel to create graphs and visuals that I put on the poster, as well as for organizing all of the data.

AI: Got it - so you used R for the statistical analysis and Excel for organizing data and creating visuals for your poster presentation. 

Where in that process, if anywhere, have you experimented with using AI tools?

User: I was not very proficient in AI yet at this point so I didn't use it too extensively, but I did use it to get some background information on some of the assays I would run.  I also used it when designing my poster to ensure that the information on it was written well.  My poster was presented at a research symposium, so it was being viewed by faculty and students alike.  I wanted to make sure that everyone could understand the research and results, without it being too "dumbed down", and AI helped me refine my wording and provided feedback.  I made sure never to use exclusively AI to get information however, and to always double-check my sources.

AI: That's really interesting - you used AI as a research assistant for background information and as a writing coach for your poster presentation. 

For the poster writing specifically, tell me about how you decided whether to use AI versus your traditional approach for refining that content.

User: I didn't use AI to determine what information to put on the poster; I consulted professors and other experts about their recommendations.  I mostly used AI to determine what the best wording for a phrase would be, and where emphasis should be placed.  Overall, I did use it very sparingly, and relied more heavily on looking at past posters and getting advice from more knowledgable parties.

AI: That makes sense - you kept the content decisions in human hands but used AI more as a writing tool for refining language and emphasis. 

Thinking about the parts of your research where you didn't use AI - like the statistical analysis in R or interpreting your assay results - what kept you from trying it there?

User: Nervousness mainly.  I didn't understand AI quite as well as I do now, and didn't know where it excelled and where it fell short.  I was also not as proficient at data analysis at the time, and I felt wary of relying on AI when I may not be able to tell if it's reasoning was faulty or it was hallucinating.

AI: That nervousness about not being able to catch potential errors makes a lot of sense, especially when you're still building your own expertise in data analysis. 

When you did use AI for background information on the assays, how did you go about verifying or validating what it produced?

User: I mainly asked the chatbot broad questions like "what is [assay] used to measure?" and "how does [assay] work?" and then based on the responses, I was able to search more specific questions on google scholar and other direct sources

AI: So you used AI as a starting point to understand the landscape, then did the deep-dive research through traditional academic sources. That's a thoughtful verification approach.

We're about halfway through our conversation now. Let me ask you this: If you could wave a magic wand and have AI help with one aspect of your research that it currently doesn't, what would that be and why?

User: Good question.  I think I would like it to be able to critique my experimental design and analysis.  Essentially, I would like it to act like a peer-reviewer

AI: That's a really compelling vision - having AI serve as a peer reviewer for experimental design and analysis. What specifically about that peer review process would be most valuable to you? Is it catching methodological issues, suggesting alternative approaches, or something else entirely?

User: Mostly catching methodical issues, logical errors, or things I may have overlooked.  Since research is often so time-consuming and expensive, it would be very valuable to have fool-proof way of making sure my design is sound before I spend the resources on it.

AI: That makes perfect sense - having that safety net before committing significant time and resources could be huge for research efficiency.

Those are all my questions - your perspectives on using AI cautiously as a complement to traditional research methods, and your vision for AI as a methodological reviewer, were particularly insightful. Is there anything else about AI in your research work that we haven't touched on that you think would be important for us to understand?

User: I don't think so, although I am sure as time goes on my usages for AI in research will evolve along with the technology.

AI: That's a great point - the relationship between researchers and AI is clearly still evolving as both the technology and users' comfort levels develop.

Thank you again for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about taking that cautious, verification-focused approach to AI integration - especially your strategy of using it as a starting point for deeper research rather than an endpoint - really help us understand the nuances of how AI fits into real scientific work. The way you balanced leveraging AI's capabilities while maintaining scientific rigor was particularly valuable to hear about.

If you have any questions about this research or would like to follow up on anything we discussed, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks again for your time!

User: Thank you!

AI: You're very welcome! I really enjoyed our conversation and learned a lot from your perspective. Have a great rest of your day!
