Assistant: Hi there! Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. I really appreciate you sharing your insights with us. I'm Claude, an AI user researcher at Anthropic, and I'm here to learn about your experiences using AI in your creative work.

We're conducting this research to better understand how creative professionals like yourself are integrating AI into their workflows and processes. There's no right or wrong answer here—we're simply interested in hearing about your authentic experiences and perspectives.

Our conversation today will last about 10 minutes. I'll ask you some questions about how you use AI in your creative work, what that experience has been like for you, and how you see things evolving. Your responses will help inform how we think about AI's role in creative fields.

Does that sound good to you? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: Continue

AI: Great! Let's dive in then.

Could you tell me a bit about your creative work and what a typical project looks like for you?

User: I'm an artist and a writer with a PhD in Visual Arts. I paint and draw and make some installation art, including site-specific temporary installations. My work is typically about the natural environment. I use AI to generate photographic quality images which I go on to edit in a photo editing program such as Pixlr. I also use AI to assist in my written visual arts research, and in crafting artist statements for exhibitions.

AI: That's fascinating - it sounds like you're working across multiple mediums and using AI in some really interesting ways. 

Walk me through how AI fits into your creative process. Where and when do you find yourself reaching for AI tools?

User: Recently I was involved in an art exhibition at a regional art gallery. I described my painting to an AI bot and asked it to generate a relevant artist statement that I could use. I could then ask for different versions of the statement, fine-tuning it by adding and subtracting different elements. For example, I could ask the AI to make a comparison of my work with a noted artist's work.

AI: That's a really interesting approach to developing artist statements. Tell me more about that process - what was it like describing your painting to the AI, and how did the different versions it generated compare to how you might have written a statement on your own?

User: Overall, I really enjoyed the process of generating the statement, since I love reading and writing. The statement generated by AI could then be hand edited to sound more like my authentic voice as an artist. The advantage of using AI is that it makes the whole process a lot faster. It can also come up with ideas that I might not have thought of myself. Then I can tweak those ideas to make them more relevant.

AI: That sounds like a really collaborative process between you and the AI. When you mention tweaking the AI's ideas to make them more relevant - can you give me an example of the kind of idea the AI might suggest that you wouldn't have thought of, and how you'd then adapt it?

User: Let's say that the AI was asked to compare my own paintings to the work of artist Cy Twombly - this could conventionally be seen as a bit of a stretch, since Cy Twombly's art is only mildly similar to my own. The AI model might throw up some random things that could be relevant - for example, we both use vibrant red and orange hues in our paintings. I might delete the word "orange" in the next version of the statement, since I would rather focus on the symbolism of the colour red. Then I can specifically ask the model to further discuss the colour red.

AI: That's a great example of how you're steering the collaboration. It sounds like the AI might make connections you hadn't considered, but then you're very much in the driver's seat about which directions to pursue.

Can you describe a specific recent project where you used AI? What role did it play, and how did that feel for you?

User: I asked the AI to generate a diary entry based on some brief notes that I had scribbled down while I was thinking about a whole lot of random things. The model had to make sense of these notes and try to put them together in a coherent narrative. It had to write this piece in a casual, personable voice as though I was writing to myself for future reference.

AI: That's really intriguing - using AI to help structure and give voice to your raw thoughts. How did it feel to see your scattered notes transformed into that coherent diary entry? And when you read what the AI created, did it feel like "you" or something else?

User: It was fun to do this kind of experiment, as I like writing. I especially like recording my thoughts. The version that the AI generated didn't sound much like me though. It sounded cliché and sanitised.

AI: That's a really insightful observation about it sounding cliché and sanitized compared to your authentic voice. When you're working with AI in your creative process - whether it's the diary entries, artist statements, or generating images - how would you describe the collaboration? Who or what feels like it's driving the creative decisions?

User: I'm the one driving the process, but the AI model can come up with interesting things that I hadn't considered. Then it's up to me to decide if I want to keep them, or if I want to change them in some way to fit my purposes. Some things I just edit out, if they aren't helpful.

AI: That sense of being in the driver's seat while still being open to unexpected contributions sounds like a really balanced approach. 

What aspects of your creative work have changed the most since you started using AI?

User: My work hasn't changed, I don't believe. I can just do things a little quicker and sometimes it can be entertaining using AI, because it's a different ambiance working with a model, rather than being totally 'alone'.

AI: That's interesting - the idea of AI providing a different ambiance, almost like having company in your creative process. You mentioned it can be entertaining to work with the model. What concerns, if any, do you have about AI's presence in your field?

User: That's a difficult question. I do have a concern that people will become creatively lazy, just using AI because it's easy and fast. A lot of the content it generates is 'good enough' and the average consumer might be impressed by it - a bit like 'fast food'. It fills a purpose. But nothing's ever going to beat fine dining! Things that are created by a human are warmer, more beautiful, more nuanced, complex, difficult and enriching.

AI: That's such a vivid analogy - fast food versus fine dining. It really captures something important about quality and depth. You clearly see human creativity as bringing something irreplaceable to the table.

Looking ahead, how do you see AI's role in your creative work evolving over the next few years?

User: I'll continue to use it when I feel the urge. It's convenient. But I won't let it replace my own creativity - that would be very unsatisfying.

AI: That makes a lot of sense - keeping it as a tool that serves your creativity rather than replacing it.

Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI in your creative processes. I particularly appreciated your perspective on maintaining creative agency while being open to AI's unexpected contributions, and that "fast food versus fine dining" analogy really captured something important about the distinction between convenience and depth in creative work.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your creative work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's it.

AI: Perfect. Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about using AI as a collaborative tool while maintaining creative control, and your thoughts on the importance of preserving the irreplaceable qualities of human creativity, will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in creative contexts.

I really appreciate how candid you were about both the benefits - like speed and unexpected ideas - and your concerns about creative laziness in the field. Have a wonderful rest of your day!
