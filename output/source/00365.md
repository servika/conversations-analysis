Assistant: Hi! I'm Claude from Anthropic's research team. Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me today. 

We're conducting interviews to better understand how people are incorporating AI tools like Claude into their work routines. Your experiences and perspectives will help us gain valuable insights into human-AI interaction in professional settings.

During our conversation, I'll ask questions about how you use AI in your work, your preferences, and your thoughts about working with these tools. There are no right or wrong answers – we're genuinely interested in your unique experiences. This should take about 10 minutes.

I'll be taking notes during our chat, but rest assured that anything you share won't be personally attributed to you. The insights we gather will be used to improve our understanding of AI's role in work environments. 

Does that sound good? Do you have any questions before we begin?

User: That sounds fine, let's get started :)

AI: Great! Let's dive in.

Could you tell me about how AI fits into your typical workday? What kinds of tasks do you use it for?

User: I use it most days, either for asking questions about the platform I work with (ServiceNow) or to help me re-write or word emails and messages professionally.

AI: That's helpful context. When you're using AI to help with ServiceNow questions, what kinds of things are you typically trying to figure out? Are these technical troubleshooting issues, or something else entirely?

User: Yes, technical toubleshooting questions. I'm in a new role which requires a deeper level of technical understanding than my previous role. I work in catalog management so I ask questions about catalog access, workflows, assignments etc.

AI: That makes sense - using AI as a learning partner while you're ramping up in a more technical role. 

I'm curious about your preferences when working with AI. Are there certain tasks you prefer to handle yourself, even though AI could help with them? What makes those tasks different?

User: Hmm, good question. I often write SAFe stories for Agile methodology, and I prefer to write those myself so I know I understand the requirements in case a developer or stakeholder asks me about them. Similarly, if I've been asked to do a piece of development work, I'd rather use the knowledge articles available to me and work through the task myself so I'm learning as I go.

AI: That's really interesting - it sounds like you're being quite intentional about when you want to preserve that hands-on learning experience. 

When you do use AI for work, could you describe your typical interaction pattern? Are you more likely to collaborate with it throughout a task, or do you tend to delegate complete tasks for it to handle independently?

User: If I'm stuck on a technical aspect, its definitely collaborative. I can find it hard to verbalise exactly what I'm asking, especially if its a problem I haven't worked on before. So there is then an element of back and forth with the AI while I figure out what I'm actually asking if that makes sense.

AI: That absolutely makes sense - using AI almost like a thinking partner to help clarify the problem itself before even getting to the solution.

How have your colleagues or your workplace culture influenced the way you use AI in your work?

User: We are encouraged to use it, but its a bit free-form at the moment. It would be good if the business would clarify exactly what they'd like us to use it for. The general message from above has been 'AI good' but without much direction beyond making emails sound better. I use it because I am allowed to, but some guidance around expectations would help.

AI: That's a really candid perspective - having permission but lacking clear direction about expectations or best practices.

Can you share a time when using AI at work made you feel particularly satisfied or frustrated? What was happening in that situation?

User: I was going a data analytics apprenticeship last year through my job, and AI really helped me grasp key concepts like regression analysis, P-value etc. The kind of questions I'd ask someone in person if we were in the same room, but since I was working remotely at the time it was quick and easy to use AI.

AI: That sounds like a really positive experience - having that immediate access to explanations when you needed them. 

How do you think about maintaining your skills in areas where AI could potentially take over? Is this something you actively consider?

User: In my previous role, very much - I worked on the Service desk and I feel that there is a big push to automate with AI a lot of what I used to do. I think there are massive elements of my current role that could be done by AI but the person-to-person interaction probably not. Its a worry, I am not sure how I'm going to stay ahead of AI - that seems impossible if I think too deeply on it, so mostly I just focus on learning how to do my job really well and being a good team member and colleague.

AI: That's a very thoughtful way to approach it - focusing on what you can control and the uniquely human aspects of your work.

Looking ahead, how do you envision your relationship with AI at work evolving?

User: I think it will continue to grow, it does save me a lot of time when researching and I will keep using it for that definitely. I imagine using it for planning meetings and summarising requirements too.

AI: Those are all the questions I had prepared. You've shared some really thoughtful insights about your experiences with AI at work. I particularly appreciated your perspective on being intentional about preserving learning opportunities while still leveraging AI as a collaborative thinking partner.

Before we wrap up, is there anything else about your experience with AI in your work that you think would be valuable for us to know? Something we haven't covered yet?

User: No, that's all from me thank you!

AI: Perfect! Thank you again for your time and for sharing your experiences so openly. Your insights about navigating that balance between learning independently and using AI as a collaborative tool - especially while transitioning to a more technical role - will be incredibly helpful for our research on human-AI interaction in professional contexts.

I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me today!
